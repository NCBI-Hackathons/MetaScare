"9468085","In most types of cancer, the formation of distant metastasis is the point at which the disease becomes lethal. At present, there is no clinical method to detect metastatic dissemination and colonization of distal sites until radiologically evident, at which point the function of the organ has already been compromised. The Shea lab has developed a biomaterial implant that recruits metastatic cancer cells in xenogeneic human and syngeneic mouse models of breast cancer. Scaffold implantation has facilitated detection of metastasis prior to colonization of organs and has been shown to reduce metastatic disease burden, ultimately resulting in enhanced survival with surgical intervention. This survival benefit associated with scaffold implantation in animal models is hugely promising, however the mechanism behind this benefit is not currently understood. Mechanistic understanding of the underpinnings of this observation will provide knowledge that will suggest if this observation can be expected in humans, and will thus inform the design of planned clinical trials. Furthermore, understanding of the mechanism underlying the observed survival benefit will also provide unprecedented evidence for how metastasis can be manipulated at a physiological systems level and inform other therapeutic targets and interventions. The specific aims of this proposal will test two hypotheses for the demonstrated therapeutic benefit. Aim 1 will quantify phenotypic heterogeneity of implant-captured tumor cells and investigate the hypothesis that these cells represent a highly plastic or stem-like population. This will be tested via isolation of scaffold captured tumor cells, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), primary tumor cells, and metastatic tumor cells in an organ (lung, liver or bone). The phenotype of cells from different locations will be compared via isolation of RNA and subsequent targeted q-RT-PCR to study differential expressions of genes associated with stemness, metastasis, differentiation, the poor-prognosis gene signature, and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition between different subpopulations. These differences will also be validated via functional assays in vitro such as migration, invasion, transendothelial migration, and mammosphere formation assays. Aim 2 will investigate the hypothesis that the scaffold immune microenvironment influences tumor cell phenotype including stemness and plasticity. This will be tested via immunomodulation of the scaffold microenvironment in vivo via lentiviral delivery of immunomodulatory factors and subsequent analysis of immune cell recruitment and subsequent tumor cell recruitment and phenotype. This data set will allow correlation of the immune composition of a pre-metastatic niche with the efficiency of tumor cell capture of that niche as well as how the niche influences tumor cell phenotype. Overall, biomaterial scaffolds capable of recruiting metastatic tumor cells in vivo represent a transformative approach that can not only to serve as a platform for early detection and intervention, but also serves as a defined site in vivo to study metastasis as a physiological systems level event."
"9445740","The proposed work is to take quantitative approach to study the effect of interplay between chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) affinity and antigen density on CAR T cell efficacy and toxicity. Aside from a limited number of surface-expressed tumor neoantigens, there is a widely acknowledged paucity of tumor-specific targets. Selectively tuning a CAR?s affinity for its target molecule can maintain its ability to lyse tumor cells exhibiting high density target expression while preventing this occurrence in normal cells with lower, basal expression. However, our current understanding of how the threshold for T cell activation and cytotoxicity is defined by the interplay between CAR affinity and antigen density is still in its infancy. Relevant studies to date have examined this relationship using CARs with crude affinity variations and target cells devoid of quantitative, antigen density measurements. Furthermore, the potential for systemic off-tumor toxicity mediated by affinity- tuned CAR T cells has yet to be evaluated in a pre-clinical environment where the CAR in question can cross- react with natural levels of its cognate host antigen, thereby rigorously performing risk assessment and therapeutic index studies of off-tumor CAR reactivity. To systematically examine the affinity tuned CAR paradigm, we have designed a CAR that specifically targets intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, a molecule that is over-expressed in multiple tumors but which retains weak expression in healthy tissue. This CAR?s antigen recognition domain is derived from the inserted (I) domain of an integrin called lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1, which we previously adapted by introducing point mutations such that step-wise variations of ICAM-1 affinity could be derived ranging from 1 mM to 1 nM Kd or 106-fold. Human LFA-1 I domain binds murine and human ICAM-1 with comparable affinity, allowing simultaneous in vivo evaluation of CAR reactivity against human ICAM-1 expressing, transplanted tumor tissue alongside any potential on-target, off-tumor reactivity/toxicity against murine ICAM-1. We have also recently developed and evaluated a genetic reporter, human somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), that enables quantitative, non-invasive real-time monitoring and tracking of T cells using positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) and clinically approved imaging reagents. In this proposal, we will 1) determine threshold CAR affinity that restricts CAR T cell cytotoxicity to tumors with over-expressed antigens, and 2) examine the influence of CAR affinity and antigen density on spatiotemporal kinetics of T cell expansion and contraction, and on the rate of tumor elimination, relapse, and systemic toxicity. The outcome of this study has the potential to significantly impact the study of CAR T cells by providing a quantitative framework for CAR T cell design and evaluation to maximize their therapeutic index."
"9501102","Project Summary     Viruses  exploit  cell  surface  receptors  to  gain  access  to  the  interior  of  host  cells.  These  receptors  are  now  appreciated as major obstacles to virus spillover, a process by which animal viruses move from one host species  into another. In the many documented examples of spillover, viruses typically use the same entry receptor in the  old  and  new  host,  but  need  to  acquire  mutations  to  make  them  compatible  with  the  specific  ortholog  of  that  receptor  found  in  the  new  host.  Diverse  viruses  such  as  avian  influenza  viruses,  rodent  arenaviruses,  MERS  coronavirus, and possibly SARS and Ebola viruses all overcame receptor barriers in humans as they transmitted  from  their  animal  hosts.  Here,  we  explore  the  following  hypothesis  of  disease  emergence:  viruses  can  more  easily  overcome  receptor  barriers  when  host  individuals  of  specific  receptor  genotypes  come  into  contact. We use the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) reservoir in African primates as a model for this, and  investigate the role that the SIV/HIV receptors, CD4 and CCR5, play in limiting spillover of these viruses. Primate  lentiviruses (SIV/HIV) are an excellent model because the HIV/SIV receptors CD4 and CCR5 serve as significant  host barriers to the spillover of these viruses between primate species. We and others have shown that (1) CD4  and CCR5 vary from one species to the next in their ability to serve as receptors for HIV/SIV, and (2) different  individuals  within  primate  populations  have  different  virus  susceptibilities  because  of  receptor  polymorphisms.  We leverage genetic data and biomaterials from approximately 1,300 primates representing 15 different species,  and  a  broad  array  of  different  HIV  and  SIV  variants,  to  test  the  idea  that  certain  individuals  within  populations  are better poised to transmit or receive infection during spillover scenarios. The main innovation of the proposal  is  to  define  the  role  of  host  genetic  variation  in  disease  emergence,  beyond  a  strict  focus  on  the  evolutionary  properties  of  viruses.  The  project  will  aid  in  our  understanding  of  the  evolutionary  processes  leading  to  the  emergence of new diseases. It is significant because the work here will be widely applicable to diverse viruses  beyond lentiviruses, and to host barriers beyond receptor blocks.       "
"9581301","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Miami's South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities (SUCCESS) aims to improve the health of South Florida's most vulnerable populations through collaborative, participatory research. Our primary focus has been to improve early detection and prevention of diseases that disproportionately affect communities, disenfranchised from the formal healthcare system. Towards this end, we have tested the effectiveness of multiple Community Health Worker (CHW)-led interventions to improve screening uptake for four priority health conditions: HIV, Hepatitis C, Colorectal Cancer (CRC), and cervical cancer. However, a major limitation of all such projects is that each has existed as distinct, standalone initiative targeting a specific community and/or individuals who meet narrow eligibility criteria. The current proposal will address this gap. We propose to develop and implement a clinical trial that offers screening for all four health conditions in a no-clinical setting, circumventing known structural and access barriers to care. Our partners in this application are our longstanding collaborators: the Health Choice Network- a consortium of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and the Center for Haitian Studies. Based on their input, we propose a pragmatic trial of 900 people ages 50-65 who self-identify as Hispanic, Haitian, and/or African and have not been appropriately screened for the aforementioned diseases of interest. Our specific aim is to determine whether a CHW led intervention, which provides innovative, home based screening increases uptake among medically underserved individuals who are in need of at least of these tests. This multi-modality approach will use oral swabs for HIV, finger stick testing for Hepatitis C, Fecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT) for CRC, and self- sampling for Human Papilloma Virus, the primary cause of cervical cancer. The proposed pragmatic trial, grounded in the tenets of community-based participatory research (CBPR), will help identify optimal strategies for delivering prevention services to medically-vulnerable population sub-groups. Our study testing innovative, cost sensitive approaches will help inform health reform strategies that increasingly prioritize population health and precision medicine."
"9406148","PROJECT SUMMARY The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), primarily associated with cigarette smoking (CS), including emphysema and bronchitis, remain unclear. Our published studies have suggested that autophagy, a lysosome-dependent pathway for the degradation of organelles and proteins, represents a major cellular and tissue response to CS exposure, in both experimental and human COPD lung. Emerging studies suggest that autophagy, while well established as a cellular survival process, can exert homeostatic or detrimental effects in complex diseases. Our studies were the first to demonstrate deleterious effects of autophagy and mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in experimental models of COPD. Mice genetically deficient in the mitophagy regulator PINK1 were resistant to experimental COPD. We discovered that mitophagy induced by CS in response to mitochondrial dysfunction activates programmed epithelial cell death, in particular the necroptosis mode of cell death. Our Preliminary Studies indicate that CS exposure can disrupt metabolic pathways, including dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and inhibition of fatty acid (FA) synthesis. Hence, we put forth the following Hypothesis: CS exposure causes epithelial cell metabolic disruption and impaired FA synthesis that causes mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to activation of PINK1-dependent mitophagy. Mitophagy in turn drives a pro-pathogenic mechanism dependent on the activation of necroptosis. Activation of this mitophagy-dependent necroptosis pathway in response to metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction may adversely affect airway function and emphysema outcomes during CS-induced COPD pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms by which CS induces mitophagy in the lung. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of impaired OXPHOS and FA synthesis on the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis and their impact on experimental COPD. Specific Aim 3: To determine the regulation of cellular necroptosis by CS, and its impact on lung functional impairment in experimental models of COPD.  "
"9406145","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as atherosclerosis and hypertension are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in our community. Furthermore these vascular complications are accelerated in the diabetic population. Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in several common human diseases, including CVDs, due to the influence of the environment which can affect epigenetic states. Evidence shows that the hormone Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a major player in the pathologies of hypertension and atherosclerosis due to its vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, and growth promoting effects in target cells such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). During the previous funding period, we reported the first functional roles for epigenetic chromatin histone modifications and non-coding RNAs in mediating some of these deleterious actions of Ang II in VSMCs. In addition, our new preliminary data show that Ang II can regulate specific novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and enhancers in VSMCs that modulate the expression of target genes associated with VSMC inflammation and dysfunction. Despite these advances, the functions of specific lncRNAs and their subtle interactions with other epigenetic factors like enhancers to modulate Ang II-induced gene expression are still not fully understood. Furthermore, the roles of enhancers, superenhancers and specific lncRNAs in Ang II-mediated VSMC dysfunction and related CVDs are not known. Our central hypothesis is that dynamic control of key lncRNAs and VSMC- specific enhancers/superenhancers, as well as epigenetic cross-talk among these factors, contribute to Ang II-induced VSMC dysfunction associated with CVDs. This will be tested through 3 Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the molecular mechanisms of regulation and functional roles of two novel lncRNAs that we found to be induced by Ang II in VSMCs. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the roles of Ang II-regulated enhancers and superenhancers in the expression of Ang II-regulated genes involved in VSMC functions. In Specific Aim 3, the in vivo expression and functional roles of the two lncRNAs and candidate enhancers/SEs will be examined in mouse models of Ang II induced vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis. This study examines several new concepts and uses innovative platforms along with functional in vivo models to gain novel insights into VSMC regulatory networks. The results and can have potentially far reaching clinical and therapeutic implications for CVDs.    "
"9507327","PROJECT SUMMARY:  During herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection, chromatin is dynamic and multiple opposing factors affect the quantity and state of histones on viral genomes. Although it is widely accepted that chromatin suppresses viral gene expression during latency, it is unclear to what extent histones participate in the temporal expression of viral genes during productive infection. Furthermore, the role chromatin remodeling complexes play in the regulation of viral genes is poorly understood. Although nucleosomes are not abundant on viral genomes during productive infection, several lines of evidence suggest that histones and chromatin remodeling factors contribute to the precise timing of the ordered expression of viral genes. During initial infection, the viral tegument protein VP16 interacts with factors to convert repressive histone modifications to active marks and remove histones from the promoters of immediate early genes. The immediate protein ICP0 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a role in the removal of repressive chromatin from incoming and quiescent genomes to promote viral gene expression. Immediate early protein ICP4, which is a transcriptional activator of early and late genes and repressor of immediate early genes, interacts with members of the SWI/SNF, NuRD, and INO80 chromatin remodeling complexes, suggesting a role for these factors in the regulation of viral genes. Specific chromatin remodeling complexes were found to associate with viral genomes during early and late stages of productive infection by iPOND (isolation of proteins on nascent DNA), including members of the FACT, SWI/SNF, NuRD, and INO80 complexes, as well as several other chromatin associated and modifying proteins. Furthermore, the INO80 and NuRD complexes were found to selectively associate with viral replication forks, suggesting involvement in the regulation of replication or replication-coupled events such as late viral gene expression. Therefore, the hypothesis to be tested in the proposed experiments is that cellular chromatin remodeling factors modulate histone interactons with viral genomes to precisely control the temporal expression of viral genes during productive infection. The overall goals of this proposal are to map the genome-wide histone landscape on viral genes at various stages of productive infection, as well as to dissect where, when, and how select chromatin remodeling complexes function during productive infection. The aims outlined in this exploratory project are to 1) map and quantify interactions between histones and chromatin remodeling proteins with HSV-1 genomes a defined stages of productive infection and 2) determine the effects of knockdown of select cellular chromatin remodeling factors on histone and RNA polymerase II occupancy on viral genomes, viral gene expression, and virus multiplication. Results from these studies will reveal epigenetic mechanisms that control viral gene expression during productive HSV-1 infection and will be used in the future to propose more developed hypotheses and in depth studies."
"9469690","Obesity is one of the greatest risk factors towards the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The rapidly increasing rates of obesity among children and adults in the United States presents a need for understanding the mechanisms of susceptibility to T2DM. Rare obesity disorders, such as the obesity ciliopathies Alström Syndrome and Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), are a valuable tool for investigating these mechanisms. Both Alström and BBS are characterized by high prevalence of obesity; however, they have strikingly different rates of T2DM. The rate of T2DM is 70% by age 20 among Alström patients, and as low as 2-6% among BBS patients. Whole transcriptome sequencing has identified several exocrine pancreas enzymes including chymotrypsin-like elastase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, which are differentially expressed between models of these disorders, potentially impacting endocrine pancreas function and development of T2DM. These enzymes were significantly downregulated in models of Alström and significantly upregulated in models of BBS. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that depleted ?-cell capacity in alms1- deficient animals is due to the loss of pancreatic proteases, and is not seen in BBS-gene depleted animals because of increased expression of the genes encoding these enzymes. We will test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: (1) Determine the role of ciliopathy proteins in protease production/secretion. (2) Determine a role for pancreatic proteases in ?-cell production. The objective of this study is to define the role that the exocrine pancreas plays in the development of T2DM in Alström and BBS, and to determine the mechanism through which this effect is carried out. This study will investigate a novel mechanism of susceptibility to the development of T2DM, loss of pancreatic proteases, and a potential novel interaction between the exocrine and endocrine pancreas."
"9397561","Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common form of valve disease in the western world and affects over 2.5 million individuals in the US. Despite the large burden of disease, there are no medical treatments to slow its development, due in large part to our incomplete understanding of this disease. With the expected increase in the burden of AS due to the aging US population, research targeted to understanding the risk factors and causes of AS is needed, and could lead to new treatment strategies. We recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, that genetic variants in LPA are strongly associated with aortic valve calcium (AVC) and clinical AS implicating circulating lipoprotein(a), an usual form of cholesterol as a cause of aortic stenosis. Although the role of Lp(a) is not fully understood, Lp(a) is a major carrier of circulating oxidized phospholipids (oxPL) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (LpPLA2). OxPLs (and by-products of their cleavage by LpPLA2) are pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory and pro-calcifying, suggesting that oxPL and Lp-PLA2 may be major determinants of Lp(a)-mediated AS. We propose to characterize the relations of Lp(a), oxPL and LpPLA2 and their potential interactions with AVC prevalence cross-sectionally and progression longitudinally, using molecular and genetic epidemiology methods in the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) and the Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). By combining two large ongoing NHLBI cohorts, we will create one of the largest cohorts worldwide with sequential valve imaging (n= 7,178; including sequential AVC measurements in 6,777 participants) to address the following aims: Specific Aim 1. To relate circulating levels of Lp(a), oxPL and LpPLA2 to the presence and progression of AVC in FOS and MESA participants and determine their relative contributions to AVC using formal mediation and/or discordance analysis. We will include 1,298 FOS participants and 5,880 MESA participants with available AVC data and relate the biomarker levels to AVC prevalence cross-sectionally and to AVC progression longitudinally using multivariable analyses adjusting for known confounders. Specific Aim 2. To evaluate for effect modification of Lp(a) (and/or oxPL) by LDL-C and/or predisposition to inflammation in the relations with presence and progression of AVC in FHS and MESA participants. We will develop multivariable models incorporating appropriate interaction terms to evaluate AVC prevalence cross- sectionally and AVC progression longitudinally. Specific Aim 3. To provide evidence in support of a causal association between these biomarkers and AVC presence/progression using Mendelian randomization in FHS and MESA participants. Our proposed project is well-aligned with the recommendations of the 2011 National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's AS Working Group and proposes to directly address several important research priorities. Findings from our proposed project will lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of AVC and may inform novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of AS."
"9414618","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Voltage-gated ion channels have evolved to open and close in response to changes in the membrane potential and rapidly conduct ions selectively. The members of the family that longest eluded isolation were the voltage-gated proton channel, Hv1, and its relatively close relative, the voltage sensing phosphatase (VSP). Hv1 plays a central role in innate immunity and other physiological processes. The biological function of VSP is not known. This proposal focuses on 3 fundamental aspects to the function of these VSD proteins, which, despite their similarities, differ radically in their effectors: with Hv1 having is channel effector uniquely situated within its VSD, while VSP's effector is the only one so far to have its effector outside of the membrane, in this case on the internal side. Our aims for Hv1 are to elucidate its pore pathway, understand how it is gated, how the gating apparatus in one subunit influences that of the dimeric partner and elucidate the mechanism by which Hv1 detects the absolute transmembrane gradient of pH and uses it to regulate gating. Our aim for VSP is to understand how conformational sequences in the VSD induce conformational sequences in the enzyme domain to alter the choice of substrate. Our goal is to arrive at mechanistic molecular models of gating, cooperativity and modulation of the VSD by pH and modulation by the VSD of the effector. The proposed studies should provide insight into the function of VSDs across voltage-gated proteins and the new methods should be applicable to a range of other channels and receptors whose protein motions, subunit interactions and modulation by ligands are of interest. The proposed work is designed to elucidate the mechanism of function of the voltage-gated proton channel (which is fundamental to innate immunity, reproduction and epithelial transport, and appears to have a role in stroke and cancer) and its relative, the voltage sensing phosphatase. The approach employs several novel optical methods that should prove to be applicable to the study of a broad set of ion channels and receptors."
"9572777","Combination drug treatment for tuberculosis (TB) can extend over 6 months which provides the perfect setup for the development of drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis (M.tb). With approximately 2 million new cases of TB each year, short course drug therapy would rapidly reduce the burden of M.tb infection and have significant impact on global public health. Targeting host responses during TB drug treatment is a novel approach to provide quicker and more effective drug treatment for TB. We hypothesize that IL-10 is the driver of the reported immune dampening properties of PZA, and that modification of IL-10 can be exploited to shorten the drug treatment time for M.tb infection. Our hypothesis is built upon preliminary data showing that PZA can clear M.tb infection to sterilization in IL-10 deficient mice within 45 days, a significant shortening of treatment time. We propose experiments to establish the causal relationship between PZA and IL-10 that accelerates the clearance of M.tb infection. These include blocking the action of IL-10 in vivo and investigating immune function during infection with a PZA resistant strain of M.tb. At the completion of these studies we will have determined the specific mechanism for how the anti-mycobacterial action of PZA is accelerated on an IL- 10 deficient background."
"9603786","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Safely escalating the radiation dose to locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients to improve local tumor control and survival remains a challenge due to the numerous types and large magnitude of day-to-day geometric change in these patients. Deformable image registration (DIR) has emerged as a powerful tool for day-to-day mapping of target and risk structures and assessing the cumulative delivered dose to guide adaptation of the treatment plan to mitigate geometric changes. However, change in tissue and organ character - tissue formation, disintegration, and change of tissue condition between healthy and diseased - during the treatment course violates the fundamental principles upon which current DIR algorithms are based. Tissue character changes are common in lung cancer, due to primary tumor and involved lymph node mass changes in response to therapy and formation, resolution, or progression of partially collapsed lung, pleural fluid, and other associated pathologies. Tissue character changes are the type of geometric change most susceptible to delivery errors, the most likely to benefit from plan adaptation, and the most common site of failure of current DIR algorithms. Consequently, failure of DIR introduces error into the adaptive radiotherapy process, limiting the ability to safely escalate the radiation dose. We propose to develop and evaluate a new type of DIR algorithm designed to perform accurately under the difficult conditions of tumor and lung tissue character change. The algorithm is specifically designed to identify and register regions of anatomy consistent in shape and tissue character from day to day, while ignoring regions of variable character (such as collapsed lung and tumor) in the registration, and reconstructing deformation in the pathological regions using the measured deformation of the adjacent, consistent anatomical features. The project will be accomplished in three specific aims. In specific aim 1, consistent anatomy registration will be developed and validated against a database of fan beam CT images of breath hold and free-breathing lung cancer patients undergoing image- guided radiation therapy. In specific aim 2, we will extend consistent anatomy registration to cone beam CT images to enable rapid estimation of tissue location and delivered dose with the patient in the treatment position. In specific aim 3, the impact of DIR error on the ability to accurately adapt the treatment plan will be measured for consistent anatomy registration and for conventional DIR, for a variety of forms of adaptive radiotherapy. This project will provide the radiation therapy community with accurate DIR to support adapting the radiation therapy treatment plan to geometric change in locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer."
"9406862","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cadmium is a heavy metal and carcinogen that is present at superfund sites, in battery manufacturing facilities, in and around zinc smelters, and in cigarettes (the most common exposure pathway). An epidemiological study of 5- to 14-year-olds in a heavily Cd-contaminated area indicated a high correlation between Cd exposure and immunomodulation1. Although the mothers of these children were likely carrying a heavy Cd body burden during the gestation of their children, the direct effects of prenatal exposure (as opposed to postnatal exposure) on measured immunomodulation cannot be distinguished-an important consideration, since the postnatal effects of prenatal and adult exposure to xenobiotics often differ markedly. Prenatal exposure of C57Bl/6 mice to Cd causes reduced regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers and markedly increased antibody (Ab) in female offspring up to 20 weeks of age. Wnt levels are also markedly reduced2 and Wnt signaling has been linked to Treg cell production and stability. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that prenatal Cd exposure decreases Wnt signaling that results in decreased Treg cell function and subsequently, increased Ab production. The limited epidemiological evidence, coupled with our laboratory studies using mice, imply that the probable immune consequences of prenatal Cd exposure are cause for alarm. The study we propose will address the overall hypothesis that prenatal exposure to Cd reduces regulatory T cell (Treg) function resulting in marked increases in antibody (Ab) which may lead to a higher propensity to developing autoimmune disease or reduced tumor surveillance. It comprises three aims: Aim 1: Determine the Effect of Prenatal Cd Exposure on T Regulatory Cells; Aim 2: Determine the Role Decreased Wnt10b Activity in CdTx Newborn Offspring Plays in Thymocyte Development; and, Aim 3: Determine the Potential for CdTx Offspring to Exhibit Exacerbated Autoimmune-Induced Pathology due to Increased Ab Production."
"9419711","Project Summary / Abstract Allelic variation in tumors is a heavily investigated topic in cancer. Some mutants in oncogenic Ras appear more oncogenic than others, leading to an overrepresentation in the frequency of those mutant alleles. However, cancer biologists have not been able to derive the molecular mechanism of allelic variation. I would like to take a molecular approach to addressing this genetic question. K-Ras(G12C) is commonly mutated in 40% of K-Ras-driven non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma tumors, and yet K-Ras(G13C), a supposedly similar mutant, only represents 1% of that tumor population. By designing chemical probes for K-Ras, we would like to elucidate fundamental mechanisms of K-Ras as an oncogenic driver. I would like to investigate the biochemical and structural differences between K-Ras(G12C) and K-Ras(G13C) using chemical probes. I hypothesize that covalent docking is a viable strategy for developing covalent probes for targets previously labeled as chemically intractable such as small GTPases such as Ras. DOCKovalent is a molecular docking software developed at UCSF by the combined efforts of the Shoichet and Taunton groups. Aim 1 involves testing DOCKovalent on K-Ras(G12C), a clinically relevant oncogene for which our group has amassed chemical and structural data. With the Shoichet lab, I have obtained preliminary data that suggests that DOCKovalent can be used to predict potent and specific small molecule probes for K-Ras(G12C). We will attempt to validate the covalent docking results using structural techniques such as X-ray crystallography and Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry. Aim 2 covers the application of covalent docking to the novel and uncharacterized oncogene, K-Ras(G13C), which has no inhibitors to date. Here, I will use a multipronged approach including structure-based linker design, molecular docking screening, and fragment- based disulfide tethering to find new potent inhibitors for K-Ras(G13C). Preliminary data reveals that K- Ras(G13C) is reactive and can be labeled by covalent electrophiles. Aim 3 involves investigating the mechanism of allelic variation in lung adenocarcinoma for K-Ras(G12C) and K-Ras(G13C). Biochemical investigations of similar mutant alleles of K-Ras have determined that K-Ras mutants differ slightly in their biochemical function and structural conformation. I will use functional assays coupled with X-ray crystallography to investigate if the same is true for K-Ras(G12C) and K-Ras(G13C). I will also use our small molecules to examine if comparable K-Ras(G12C) and K-Ras(G13C) lung adenocarcinoma cell lines have differential sensitivity to inhibition of downstream Ras-driven pathways. Completion of this project will elucidate the differences between these two important oncogenic mutants with the potential for future application to other K-Ras mutants. This project will furthermore validate the DOCKovalent method as a strategy for mutant- specific inhibitor development for small GTPases."
"9282270","Abstract  Congenital pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency (PDCD) is a life-threatening mitochondrial disease of metabolic integration in which the efficient conversion of carbohydrate fuel into energy is perturbed. There are no proven therapies for PDCD. However, dichloroacetate (DCA) represents targeted potential therapy for this disease by stimulating residual PDC activity, decreasing hyperlactatemia and improving mitochondrial energetics. This background and our preliminary data suggest that DCA may benefit the clinical status of PDCD children. We have worked closely with the FDA and a parent-driven organization to develop an appropriate study design and identify prospective subjects. We now propose to undertake a 4 year phase 3 clinical trial to test the hypotheses that oral DCA will improve at-home functionality of affected children compared to placebo and will be well-tolerated and safe for chronic use. Our primary endpoint will be based on an improved clinical status, as determined by a novel, Observer Reported Outcome (ObsRO) measure. Our secondary endpoints will include 1) confirmation of better clinical outcome by the Karnofsky/Lansky performance scale of home functionality in children with life- threatening disease; and 2) decreased lactatemia."
"9450382","Project Summary Acute Lung injury especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been identified as life threatening conditions associated with significant mortality rate. Despite advances in the past decades in the knowledge on lung diseases, ARDS continues to claim the lives of more than 40% of its victims. The increase in health care associated costs has a major economic impact, while major clinical efforts to manage this disease are insufficient due to an uncomplete understanding of the mechanisms that control the pathology manifestations. Blood platelets, neutrophils and endothelial cells have been identified as the key components in the progression of ALI/ARDS. Moreover, our understanding of platelets function has shifted over the past years from a simple hemostatic tool to dynamic modulators of the immune response. The current paradigm of platelets intents to uncover the molecular mechanisms that make these cells major orchestrators of inflammation. Previous reports have demonstrated that the absence of platelets leads to increase endothelial damage, aberrant neutrophil function and hemorrhage during inflammation. Moreover, these effects have been shown to be controlled by the release of platelet granules during activation. To date, the identity of the platelet granule molecule or molecules involved in this remains to be elucidated representing gab in our knowledge. Accordingly, this study seeks to identify key platelet components that modulate systemic response during inflammation through the modulation of neutrophil-endothelial cell crosstalk and mechanisms involved. To dissect that question we will evaluate a platelet granule product known as TLT-1 in the mediation of the signaling mechanisms that modulates neutrophil -endothelial cell cross-talk during inflammation. The basis for the selection of TLT-1 as a potential target emerges from previous studies that demonstrated that TLT-1 knockout mice exhibited increased edema and hemorrhage together with a marked dysfunction of neutrophils during inflammation elicited by the Schwartzman reaction derived vasculitis. Moreover, we have evaluated TLT-1 functions in other models of inflammation including a mouse model of ALI using intranasal inoculation of LPS. Our preliminary data shows that TLT-1 prevents inflammatory associated hemorrhage while facilitate neutrophils transmigration in lung leading to decrease endothelial damage. Therefore, based on these previous observations we hypothesize that TLT-1 mediates the signaling mechanisms that regulate neutrophil capacity to transmigrate to the inflammatory site and modulate neutrophil- endothelial cell interactions during inflammation and therefore controlling the immune response. We developed two specific aims to answer that question. The aims are as follows: (i) Define a role for TLT-1 in platelet-neutrophill-endothelial cell interactions during inflammation and (ii) Elucidate the therapeutic effects of TLT-1 on ALI/ARDS. This two aims will help to fulfill our current understanding of platelet biological functions in inflammation. The answers obtained through the realization of this research work will empower our knowledge to be able to develop new alternative treatments directed to control systemic response to inflammation."
"9546423","PROJECT SUMMARY Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are the most common type of cytotoxic proteins produced by bacterial pathogens. At high levels, these toxins can lyse target host cell membranes, but during an actual in vivo infection it is likely rare that PFTs reach lytic concentrations. Instead, recent work from our lab and others indicates that sub-lytic amounts of PFTs can affect host cell functions in more indirect ways by modulating host signaling and proteolytic cascades. The PFT ?-hemolysin (HlyA) is often expressed by strains of Extraintestinal Pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), the leading cause of both bloodstream and urinary tract infections (UTIs). During an infection, HlyA can inactivate host phagocytes, alter inflammatory responses, and disrupt tissue barriers. Consequently, ExPEC strains that express HlyA are able to cause more severe and disseminated infections. The mechanisms by which HlyA and related PFTs alter host functions and elicit tissue damage without causing outright host cell lysis are poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that HlyA intoxication triggers the cellular redistribution and activation of TRY4. HlyA-induced activation of TRY4 in bladder epithelial cells and macrophages leads to the proteolytic cleavage of numerous host components, including several cytoskeleton- associated factors and central regulators of host inflammatory responses. Interestingly, others have shown that the aberrant activation and extracellular release of TRY4 can stimulate the metastatic growth of several cancer cell types and may also promote the development of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The pathways by which TRY4 is activated and re-localized in these diseases, or in response to HlyA intoxication, are for the most part unknown. Here, we propose to define the mechanisms and consequences of HlyA-induced TRY4 activation and re-localization using cell culture and murine models of UTI and sepsis. This work will provide fresh insight into the functions of a widespread ExPEC-associated toxin, and will likely be relevant to HlyA- like PFTs that are encoded by a number of other important bacterial pathogens. In addition, our results may aid the development of new anti-virulence strategies for combating ExPEC and could help explain the dysregulation of TRY4 that occurs with other pathological conditions that are not typically associated with infectious disease."
"9407304","PROJECT SUMMARY Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States (US) and the world, accounting for over 150,000 deaths per year in the US alone. Recently, understanding of the biology of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has increased. Although many patients are treated with agents targeting specific driver mutations in their tumor, such agents are unavailable for most patients, and resistance eventually emerges.  Agents directed against the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint have recently shown great promise. Although associated with an objective response rate (ORR) of about 20% in unselected metastatic NSCLC patients, the quality and duration of responses can be profound, particularly in a field accustomed to progression of disease after six months with even the most effective therapies  A substantial debate is based on the predictive nature of biomarkers to select patients for therapy. Many were surprised by the results of a study of 495 NSCLC patients I led suggesting an association between ORR and PD-L1 expression. In a training set, we found that staining for PD-L1 in at least half of the tumor cells predicted a greater ORR. When we looked to validate our results in independent patients, the ORR was 45.2% in those with staining in at least half of their tumor cells compared to 16.5% and 10.7% in those with lesser or absent staining respectively. Similar results were seen for progression free and overall survival.  Further evidence has been generated looking at other potential biomarkers. We collaborated with others to show that the number of non-synonymous mutations correlated with durable clinical benefit (partial response or stable disease lasting at least 6 months). We also saw correlations with outcome and a history of current or prior cigarette smoking, pre-biopsy CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and expression of certain genes and miRNAs. Yet, no single factor predicts outcome at the level of precision that would be ideal for clinical practice. Further, despite the correlation of each factor with clinical-outcome, the different factors don't correlate with one another particularly strongly.  We have banked specimens from well over 100 patients treated with a PD-1 inhibitor to date. In light of recent drug approvals, working with our affiliated satellite offices and a network of community oncologists with whom we collaborate, the TRIO-US network, we will rapidly bank additional high quality specimens that are associated with clinical data. With these specimens, we plan to be able to create models that can effectively predict which patients stand to benefit from PD-1 inhibitors. The specific aims of this project are: 1. Define the clinical characteristics and the properties of the tumor and immune microenvironment that predict response to single agent PD-1 inhibition in a training set 2. Create models to identify the likelihood of benefit from PD-1 inhibition in NSCLC 3. Validate the models generated from the training set samples in an independent set of samples"
"9416694","ABSTRACT Noise-induced hearing loss affects more than 25 million adults, with the majority of these cases suspected to be the result of exposure to environmental sounds. Importantly, some humans with no overt indications of hearing loss have extraordinary difficulty processing speech in noisy environments, but only recently has a potential explanation emerged. Noise exposure at sound pressure levels that cause a temporary threshold shift but no permanent threshold shift results in a loss of ribbon synapses (synaptopathy) without any hair cell loss, and a reduction in the amplitude of auditory brainstem response (ABR) Wave I. Low spontaneous rate (LSR) auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) seem particularly susceptible to this loss. While these effects are well described in rodents, it is not clear that they occur in humans. It is impossible to demonstrate synaptopathy directly in humans. We propose to bridge this gap by performing parallel experiments in humans and an animal model that shares great similarity, both anatomically and mechanistically, with humans: macaques. Our recently developed macaque model of synaptopathy shares some features with the established rodent model, but also reveals differences in susceptibility, which may also be present in other primates such as humans. We propose parallel experiments in control and noise-exposed macaques (without and with synaptopathy, respectively) and in two groups of humans with normal hearing thresholds: a control group and a noise-exposed human cohort. Our overarching hypothesis is that synaptopathy caused by noise exposure impairs temporal processing, resulting in deficits in physiological (Aim1) and behavioral (Aims 2) metrics of suprathreshold stimulus processing, and these deficits will be correlated with the amount of synaptopathy, which will be verified by histology and ANF recordings in macaques (Aim 3). We predict that physiological measures of processes that involve LSR fibers (including coding of modulation in suprathreshold sounds and masked sounds, middle ear muscle reflexes, and recovery from forward masking) will be impaired in subjects with synaptopathy relative to normal subjects (Aim 1). We predict that behaviors that require temporal cues to process simple stimuli (detection of amplitude modulation, suprathreshold masked detection, forward masking thresholds, and the contribution of temporal cues to the detection of suprathreshold tones in noise) and complex stimuli (speech-in-noise and spatial-attention tasks, and release from masking) will be impaired in subjects with synaptopathy (Aim 2). The synaptopathy will be histologically verified and its ANF correlates (loss of LSR fibers) verified directly in macaques (Aim 3). The results of these studies will reveal sensitive physiological and behavioral markers of synaptopathy, validated by histological and neurophysiological findings in macaques. These parallel studies in humans and macaques will elucidate the functional consequences of synaptopathy on auditory perception. Results of our coordinated research program will be used to develop reliable, clinically viable physiological and behavioral indicators of human synaptopathy."
"9488317","Project Summary Rejection remains a major hurdle to long-lasting transplant survival. From a clinical standpoint current immunosuppression protocols are fantastic in short-term transplant survival, but do little in promoting long- term graft outcomes. Thus, there is a pressing need to uncover effector programs that may emerge under broad immunosuppressive conditions that can mediate graft loss, with a goal of further improving long term transplant outcomes. We recently discovered that unlike other Th subsets, Th9 cells are robustly induced in an immunosuppressive milieu, suggesting that Th9 cells may be especially relevant to graft loss under conditions of immunosuppression. Th9 cells are induced in massive numbers when the default Th1/Th2 programs are inhibited and require the formation of super-enhancers at Il9 locus (not lineage specific transcription factors). Importantly, formation of Il9 super-enhancers requires OX40 signaling. Also, OX40 is remarkably potent in redirecting Foxp3+ Tregs to inflammatory Th9 cells. Based on the unexpected potency of OX40 in robust Th9 induction, as well as the unexpected mode of actions of OX40 stimulation, we propose to test a unifying hypothesis in this proposal, namely- suppression of the default T cell programs in an immunosuppressive milieu allows OX40 to promote alternative Th9 programs in triggering rejection of otherwise tolerant grafts. We propose 3 Aims in this proposal. Aim 1 focuses on identifying novel mechanisms by which OX40 promotes massive Th9 cells, examining formation, structure, and activities of super-enhancers at Il9 locus. Aim 2 investigates how OX40 redirects Foxp3+ Tregs to Th9 cells, focusing on the newly identified Foxp3 repressors in shutting down Foxp3 expression and examine whether Foxp3 may disrupt IL-9 super enhancer formations. Aim 3 examines the impact of Th9 cells in transplant survival, testing whether targeting super-enhancers or checkpoints in Th9 induction enables robust allograft tolerance. We believe that the proposed studies will unravel new mechanisms of tolerance resistance in transplant recipients, and findings from these studies will have broad impacts on other immune-mediated diseases as well, including cancer immunotherapies and autoimmune diseases."
"9436450","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. There is an urgent need for new, shorter drug regimens. This proposal addresses two critical impediments for TB drug development: (1) limited understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) phenotypes that persist during the late ?sterilizing? phase of TB treatment and are the cause of relapse and (2) lack of accurate markers of treatment response for use in clinical trials. Our central innovation is evaluating drug activity based on non-coding precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA), an unstable intermediate product that is transiently present during rRNA synthesis. This measures a fundamental bacterial process ? the rate of bacterial rRNA synthesis ? that is directly correlated with bacterial replication rate. Our experiments have suggested that Mtb subpopulations that persist after exposure to different antibiotics have a spectrum of rRNA synthesis and replication rates ranging from non-replicating (rifampin, bedaquiline) to continuing active replication (isoniazid, streptomycin, clofazamine). Our overall hypothesis is that the ratio of pre-rRNA to 23S rRNA will demonstrate that: (1) Mtb persister phenotypes range from non-replicating and dormant to actively replicating, depending on drug exposure and (2) the physiologic state of Mtb in human sputum is transformed by TB treatment. Our long-term objective is to develop novel surrogate markers for trials and provide critical biologic insights into persistence. Our scientific approach involves paired in vitro experiments and clinical studies. Using several complementary experimental approaches, we will first validate pre-rRNA to 23S ratios in vitro as accurate markers of Mtb replication state. We will then determine the impact of antibiotics (individually and in combination) on pre-rRNA to 23S ratios and Mtb replication. Finally, we will determine if pre-rRNA to 23S rRNA ratios independently predict Mtb growth in the sputum of Vietnamese and Ugandan patients during the intensive phase of TB treatment. This will lay a foundation for definitive testing in TB clinical trials. We believe this work has potential to lead to a new era in which TB drug trial decisions are based not on culture-based surrogates but rather on precise, in vivo molecular markers of the pathogen's physiologic state. This will accelerate design and evaluation of shorter and more effective TB drug regimens, and suggest new targets to be explored for future TB drug development."
"9404412","Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a novel analytic software module for tumor growth rate assessment during therapy in advanced lung cancer patients. Tumor growth rate is a novel concept for evaluation of clinical benefit of cancer therapy and is proposed as objective guides for treatment decisions, however is not included in the current standards of tumor response evaluation. The concept of tumor growth rate is especially important in patients with specific mutations in their tumors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in lung cancer, treated with personalized therapy specifically targeting their mutations. EGFR-mutant patients show initial dramatic response to targeted therapy using EGFR inhibitors; however, their tumors grow back and eventually progress. Current clinical practice lacks objective guidelines about when EGFR inhibitor therapy can be safely continued while tumors are growing back, and the decision is left to treating physicians? discretions. Similar clinical scenarios are observed during therapy using other targeting agents for various cancers, indicating an increasing clinical demand to fulfil this unmet need for objective guides for treatment decisions in the era of precision cancer therapy. Investigators of this academic-industrial partnership team have developed a method to objectively characterize of tumor growth rate over time using the serial clinical CT imaging data obtained in patients receiving cancer therapy. The method was applied to EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients as a well-studied paradigm, and provided a reproducible reference value that indicates fast versus slow growth. Given the demonstrated feasibility as a clinical investigation, the team proposes to deliver this novel analytic functionality to the clinical setting, by developing an automated analytic tool for tumor growth rate assessment and interpretation, which is essential to make the approach more widely adaptable within the clinical workflow. The academic-industrial team consists of accomplished investigators from Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women?s Cancer Center and industrial scientists from Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, with expertise in oncology, radiology, biostatistics, and engineering, who have a track record of productive collaboration. The team has started to work together to address the following aims: Aim 1) Develop an analytic software module for tumor growth rate in lung cancer during therapy, which operates on an existing workstation; Aim 2) Optimize the module based on the reproducibility assessment and user feedback in a pilot cohort of 30 EGFR-mutant patients; and Aim 3) Apply the analytic software module for tumor growth rate in lung cancer patients treated in prospective trials. Delivery of the novel analytic module for tumor growth rate to the clinical setting will provide objective guides for treatment decision making during cancer therapy, and help to maximize the benefit of precision therapy for cancer. The demonstrated productivity of academic-industrial partnership with bidirectional research relationship further ensures successful completion of the project goal."
"9403260","Project Summary/Abstract Metabolic imaging using hyperpolarized (HP) 13C and 15N substrates offers the potential to monitor intermediary metabolism in tissues throughout the human body. HP-[1-13C]pyruvate is the molecule most widely used in HP studies, but there are several other TCA cycle intermediates that meet the requirements of a good metabolic imaging candidate probe. In this TR&D Project we propose to develop new 13C- and 15N-enriched compounds as reporters of tissue physiology and metabolism. We will apply these hyperpolarized sensors to measure important physiological parameters at sensitivity levels never before achieved by MRI. One of the main thrusts of this proposal is to develop HP-13C labeled mono-esters of TCA cycle intermediates to image whole-body glucose production because this could potentially have an enormous impact on development of new drugs to control glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patient populations. Thus, Aim 1 will focus on the design, synthesis and DNP hyperpolarization of monoesters of 13C-labeled TCA cycle intermediates such as [4-13C]oxaloacetate-1-ethyl ester, [4-13C]malate-1-ethyl ester, and [1-13C]-2-ketoglutarate-4-ethyl ester. The 13C-enriched carbon in these molecules should display long T1 values and these derivatives should enter hepatocytes quickly via mono-carboxylate transporters and hydrolyze to their respective dicarboxylate intermediates. 15N is another attractive nucleus for the design of HP-probes but its potential for metabolic imaging has largely remained unexplored. In Aim 2 novel 15N- labeled molecular design platforms are proposed that will yield HP-15N-agents for imaging pH and free Zn2+-levels in zinc-rich tissues.. Considering the fact that HP-[1-13C]pyruvate is the most popular molecule of choice for metabolic MR imaging, in Aim 3, a practical chemical approach will be developed to produce gram quantities of HP-[1-13C]pyruvate by starting with an ester of pyruvate and para-H2. If we are successful, this would make HP-[1-13C]pyruvate more widely available to MRI clinics across the country for molecular imaging of cancer and other metabolic diseases. The overarching goal of this core project is to develop and implement novel hyperpolarized agents in vivo to image important biomarkers and metabolic pathways in type 2 diabetes, cancer and other diseases."
"9597530","There is a fundamental lack of understanding in how the structure and architecture of a synthetic polymer influences recognition in biological systems. Furthermore, there is a disconnection between the properties of polymers in solution and the solid state with their relationships with biological systems. Understanding how the conformational dynamics of a synthetic polymer can enhance biological recognition will advance fields including targeted drug delivery, antimicrobial agents, and tissue engineering. However, gaining the knowledge required to address this fundamental gap first necessitates the capability to synthesize precision macromolecules and scaffolds through a biocompatible approach. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a modular polymerization technology, using organic photocatalysts, for 3D printing of scaffolds with precisely defined molecular, chemical, mechanical, and geometric properties targeting lung tissue restoration. The central hypothesis of this research program is that the ability to use our biocompatible photo- mediated polymerization technology for 3D printing of scaffolds with defined components over several different length scales will enable tuning the scaffold for nurturing tissue growth. The overall objective of this application is to advance our polymerization technology using organic photocatalysts to mediate a metal free atom transfer radical polymerization en route to realizing a stereospecfic radical polymerization through flow chemistry reaction engineering design. With the capability to synthesize functionally diverse stereoregular polymers, we will determine the effects of polymer tacticity on their antimicrobial activity and selectivity for bacteria and compatibility with mammalian cells. Through catalyst development and expansion of monomer scope, we will establish a photographic photolithography approach to write distinct 2 and 3D polymer patterns in chemical composition through monomer selection. Furthermore, our approach to connect polymers in solution to those in the solid state will investigate molecular brush copolymers as intermediate macromolecules that possess characteristics similar to both forms. We will introduce these molecular brush copolymers into biological systems to explore the differences between them and the discrete polymer chains from our concurrent cell studies. These findings will help resolve the essential structural features of polymers to yield efficient solid state scaffolds for tissue engineering. The innovation of this research is within the methodology built upon our group?s foundational and ongoing work of developing an organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization, which promises to yield new materials for introduction in biomedical applications. The rationale for this research is that it brings forth new materials that are only accessible through the development of our polymerization technology, which will allow the design and synthesis of polymers that more efficiently mimic natural systems for enhanced biological recognition."
"9503534","Candida albicans is a leading fungal pathogen, causing over 10,000 lethal invasive infections per year in the US. This organism can grow in several morphological forms, notably budding yeast and hyphae. Hyphae are prominent in infected tissue, and many lines of evidence indicate that the program of hyphal formation is required for pathogenicity during invasive infection. C. albicans is surrounded by a cell wall that is the target of echinocandin antifungals, which are used clinically, as well as several other therapeutic strategies under development. The organism's response to stress caused by cell wall inhibitors enables it to survive echinocandin treatment. Defects in known cell wall stress response regulators, such as the conserved Cell Wall Integrity MAP Kinase pathway components, cause C. albicans to become hypersensitive to echinocandins. The yeast and hyphal growth forms differ considerably in cell wall constituents. For example, the highly expressed yeast-specific gene YWP1 encodes a cell wall protein; the highly expressed hyphal-specific genes ALS3, HWP1, and HYR1 encode cell wall proteins. On this basis we suspected that the cell wall stress response may differ between yeast and hyphae. To date, the response to cell wall stress has been characterized primarily in yeast-form C. albicans cells. Because of the role of hyphae in pathogenesis, we hypothesize that the cell wall stress response in hyphal cells may be significant for its relevance to drug therapy and, potentially, for enabling resistance to arise. Our preliminary results have revealed unique features of the cell wall stress response in hyphae. First, RNASeq data show that the hyphal gene expression response to echinocandin treatment is distinct from that observed in yeast-form cells. Second, we have found that the transcription factor Cup9 is required for echinocandin tolerance in hyphae, but not in yeast. A cup9?/? mutant fails to express ~10% of the hyphal echinocandin-inducible genes, thus suggesting that additional transcription factors mediate the hyphal cell wall stress gene expression response. We propose to extend our studies through three specific aims. First, we will determine the functional role of the hyphal cell wall stress transcriptional response. Second, we will determine which regulators govern the hyphal cell wall stress transcriptional response. Third, we will determine which hyphal cell wall proteins influence functional aspects of the hyphal cell wall stress response."
"9405919","PROJECT SUMMARY The homeodomain transcription factor, NKX2-5, is the most commonly mutated gene associated with congenital heart defects (CHDs), accounting for 1-4% of specific malformations with a predilection for abnormalities at the arterial and venous poles of the heart. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac malformations found in patients with NKX2-5 mutations remain poorly understood. To improve diagnostic and therapeutic measures in these cases, a more precise understanding of early cardiac developmental processes at the outflow (OFT) and inflow (IFT) tracts is critical. The embryonic heart begins as a linear tube derived from first heart field (FHF) progenitors, with expansion occurring through accretion of late-differentiating cells of the second heart field (SHF) to the arterial and venous poles. Nkx2-5 is expressed in both the FHF and SHF and, while vital functions of Nkx genes in the FHF have been implicated in cardiac specification and morphogenesis, little is known about the distinct mechanisms regulated by Nkx genes in the anterior (aSHF) and posterior (pSHF) SHFs. By exploiting benefits of the zebrafish model, we recently published evidence demonstrating that nkx2.5 and nkx2.7, two NKX2-5 homologs expressed in the zebrafish heart, play essential roles in maintaining ventricular identity and display similar chamber-specific functions in SHF cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, our preliminary data provide new evidence that nkx genes exhibit previously unappreciated, crucial functions in regulating SHF progenitor populations through discrete mechanisms at OFT and IFT. We find that Nkx genes promote aSHF progenitor augmentation at the arterial pole and restrict isl1, a LIM homeodomain transcription factor, to the sinus venosus. In this proposal, we test the novel hypothesis that nkx genes are required to recruit aSHF progenitors to the OFT and to restrict pSHF progenitors via isl1 to the IFT. In Aim 1, we will dissect the cellular and temporal roles of Nkx genes in specification, accretion, proliferation, and identity maintenance in the aSHF and pSHF employing heat-shock inducible overexpression of nkx2.5, time series analysis, EdU incorporation studies, developmental timing assays, and state-of-the-art microscopy. In Aim 2, we will utilize the zebrafish model along with CRISPR and ChIP methodologies to examine previously unrecognized direct and indirect downstream effectors of Nkx genes and also new candidates associated with CHD in humans. Combining the tools available in zebrafish and human genomics data, our research will uncover the developmental mechanisms regulated by Nkx genes that are responsible for SHF-derived CHDs, some of the most severe and lethal malformations associated with NKX2-5 mutations."
"9425403","Abstract We propose an open label, dose-escalation, phase I/II study in which a single dose of the novel recombinant AAV vector, AAV2/8 HLP FVIII-V3co, will be administered into a peripheral vein of  adult subjects with severe hemophilia A . Our premise is that this will be a safe and efficacious  approach for limiting the bleeding propensity of these patients . Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked  recessive bleeding disorder that results from a defect in the factor VIII (FVIII) gene. FVIII encodes a glycoprotein procofactor which, when activated by thrombin, interacts with factor IXa in the coagulation cascade, leading to clot formation. Clinically, the disease is characterized by frequent spontaneous bleeding, which can be life-threatening. There are several novel aspects to our approach to liver-targeted AAV-mediated FVIII gene transfer, including 1) a unique FVIII cDNA that meets the size constraints of AAV and mediates synthesis of fully functional FVIII protein, 2) an expression cassette that improves the efficiency of FVIII expression and secretion and 3) an improved method of recombinant AAV vector production. Our extensive studies in murine models and rhesus macaques have shown that AAV2/8 HLP FVIII-V3co vector safely establishes therapeutic levels of FVIII in these animals. In addition, we now have the unique experience of having conducted a successful phase I/II clinical trial of liver-targeted, AAV-mediated FIX gene transfer for hemophilia B that has provided new insights to the design of our AAV-mediated FVIII gene transfer trial. We propose to test three dose levels: 6x1011, 2x1012 and 6x1012 vg/kg. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of systemic administration of this vector while the secondary objectives are: 1) to determine the dose of vector particles required to achieve stable expression of FVIII ?5% of normal; 2) to explore the impact on quality of life, emotional health and neurocognitive function; 3) to describe the immune responses to the FVIII transgene product and AAV capsid proteins and 4) to assess viral shedding into various body fluids. Recruitment will be limited to adults (?18 years of age) with a confirmed diagnosis of severe HA caused by a mutation in the FVIII gene not associated with a high incidence of inhibitor formation. In addition, participants must have had ?50 exposure days of treatment with FVIII protein concentrate without having developed an inhibitor. Dose escalation will proceed based on safety (primary) and efficacy (secondary) criteria. Immunosuppression will not be given routinely to patients receiving the lowest dose of vector; rather, only for those low dose patients who develop ALT elevation >1.5-times baseline. However, based on our AAV2/8 FIX experience, all patients in the intermediate and high dose cohorts will receive prophylactic steroids from weeks 6-13. Stopping rules are in place which include: 1) the occurrence of Grade IV or V toxicity in one patient or Grade III toxicity in two patients at a given dose level or 2) the development of neutralizing antibodies to FVIII in one patient."
"9470179","Project Abstract Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The World Health Organization recently released guidelines that endorse alternatives to cytology-based screening, including HPV-based screening and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), which will facilitate increased screening coverage and detection of curable precursors to cervical cancer. In order to reduce the burden of cervical cancer, highly effective screening strategies must be combined with affordable and accessible treatment of precancerous lesions. The standard treatment for cervical precancer, gas-based cryotherapy, is often not accessible in LMICs because gas tanks are generally expensive, difficult to obtain, and hard to transport. With the number of screening options increasing, an urgent need exists for a point-of- care treatment technology that is accessible, portable, and inexpensive. We innovated the original thermoablator, an existing cervical precancer treatment device with a probe heated to 100-120º C, for use on a wider scale by customizing the device for LMICs in order to meet this need. This academic-industrial partnership will compare this novel device to traditional CO2-based cryotherapy for the treatment of cervical precancer in LMICs. The Specific Aims of this project are to 1) modify a novel thermoablation prototype adapted and optimized specifically for treatment of cervical precancer in LMICs, determine a more nearly optimal patient- centered protocol for treatment of high-grade precancer, demonstrate that the efficacy of LMIC-adapted thermoablator is non-inferior to CO2-based cryotherapy for the treatment of cervical precancer, and determine the cost-effectiveness of all evaluated therapeutic and post-treatment surveillance strategies. The hypothesis being tested is that this novel device is non-inferior to CO2-based cryotherapy in terms of clinical validity and cost- effectiveness. The research team has well-established relationships with leading regional organizations that provide guidance to government-run cervical cancer prevention programs. Deployment of the LMIC-adapted thermoablator to existing programs will not only improve program efficacy, but will also serve as a model for adoption of this technology in the region. The results of this study will affect other research areas by serving as a springboard to exploring treatment alternatives that are amenable to low-resource settings and thus will reach the most vulnerable populations."
"9521768","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart disease remains the most common cause of death in our society. While therapies have evolved considerably over the past decades, this evolution has paralleled the creation of a growing number of patients with chronic heart failure. Our broader understanding of the pathophysiology of disease beyond the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system is necessary to develop additional tools to treat heart failure. The role of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy in maintaining critical protein quality control functions in the heart has gained increasing attention due to the apparent role of misfolded proteins in the pathogenesis of heart failure. However, there is a broad gap in our understanding of how the UPS and autophagy systems are directed by ubiquitin ligases, the proteins that give specificity to both systems. The broad long-term goal of this project is to delineate the mechanisms that Muscle Ring Finger (MuRF) ubiquitin ligases regulate PPAR?, PPARß/?, and PPAR?1 activities, mitochondrial dynamics, and autophagy in the context of heart failure. Based on our preliminary studies, our central hypothesis is that the MuRF ubiquitin ligases are regulate PPAR?, PPARß/?, and PPAR?1 activities, control mitochondrial ROS, and are involved in autophagy to contextually protect cardiomyocytes in heart failure. A corollary hypothesis is that inhibiting MuRF1 may specifically protect against Calpain1-induced heart failure to provide a more specific cardioprotective anti-Calpain1 target in vivo. Our hypothesis predicts that inhibiting specific MuRF activities may be detrimental in heart failure where PPAR signaling is central to its pathogenesis (diabetic cardiomyopathy) or helpful where Calpain1 is mediates heart failure (ischemia reperfusion injury). The central hypothesis will be tested by completing the following Specific Aims (SA): (1) Elucidate the unique roles of MuRF family ubiquitin ligases in diabetic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. (2) Determine the molecular mechanisms MuRF1-dependent Calpain1 activity regulates cardiac mitochondrial function and ROS. (3) Determine the mechanisms cardiac MuRF1 regulates autophagy in vivo to enhance the heart's resistance to ischemia reperfusion injury and heart failure. For SA1, we will characterize the mechanisms MuRF2 and MuRF3 are protective in a high fat diet induced diabetic cardiomyopathy. For SA2, we'll determine the role of MuRF1-dependent Calpain1 in regulating ROS, mitochondrial dynamics, and eEF2 in heart failure. SA3 investigates the mechanisms MuRF1 regulates autophagy to integrate additional ways in which inhibiting MuRF1 may be contextually protective in heart failure. The present studies offer innovative paradigms elucidating the mechanisms in which MuRF proteins may be targeted for their ability to protect the heart in the context of heart failure."
"9471109","Prostate cancer (PCa) accounts for an estimated 26,120 deaths in 2016 representing the second-greatest cause of cancer death among men. Recent molecular characterization of PCa has revealed striking genomic heterogeneity and defined distinct molecular subclasses that may provide insight to the variable clinical course. Recurrent mutations in SPOP are the most common point mutations in prostate cancer, occurring in about 10% of patients across early and advanced disease. SPOP is a substrate receptor of the Cullin 3-based ubiquitin ligase, which recruits androgen receptor (AR), TRIM24 and SRC-3 and other key regulators for ubiquitination and degradation, thereby governing the threshold of AR transcription, DNA damage repair, and tumor suppression. SPOPmut defines a distinct molecular class of prostate cancer characterized by activation of AR signaling and impairment of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair with transcriptional response (gene set signature) similar to that of BRCA1 inactivation. We have interrogated the TCGA RNA-seq datasets on primary (untreated) prostate cancer to define a SPOPmut transcriptional signature of 213 differentially expressed genes, and validated in independent RNA-seq cohorts for significant enrichment of this gene set in multiple cohorts of SPOPmut cases. Surprisingly, we also detected primary prostate tumors without mutation of the SPOP gene, yet showing the same gene expression characteristics to the SPOP mutant subclass, indicating that other events can phenocopy SPOP mutations in these primary ?SPOPmut-like? PCa.  To further understand the function and regulation of SPOP in prostate tumorigenesis, we performed tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry analysis, and identified G3BP1 as a novel SPOP- binding protein. G3BP1 is not a substrate of SPOP, but acts as a potent inhibitor of the SPOP ubiquitin ligase. This first-in-kind SPOP inhibitor revealed previously unrecognized means of SPOP inactivation that is independent of PCa-associated SPOP gene mutations. Importantly, we detected abnormally high levels of G3BP1 in PCa either with or without SPOP mutations. We hypothesize that dysregulation of G3BP1 defines a new subclass of prostate cancer with SPOPmut-like molecular signature, pathophysiological characteristics, and sensitivity to AR- and PARP targeting therapeutics. This application is built upon the unique and complementary strengths and resources of a team of investigators in prostate cancer genomics and pathology (Rubin), molecular classification, clinical management and precision therapy of PCa patients (Barbieri), computational genomics (Sboner), and cullin-based ubiquitin ligases (Zhou). In this proposal, we will 1) determine the clinical value of G3BP1 dysregulation in PCa classification and potential therapeutic implications, 2) determine the biochemical mechanisms underlying SPOP inhibition by G3BP1 and the roles of this newly discovered G3BP1-SPOP ubiquitin signaling pathway in AR transcription, DNA repair and prostate tumorigenesis, and 3) assess the susceptibility of G3BP1high PCa to AR- and PARP-targeting therapies."
"9454087","PROJECT SUMMARY Child mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders are a critical public health problem, affecting between 13%- 20% of U.S. children. A barrier constraining the ability of existing interventions to more effectively combat these disorders is a lack of understanding regarding how preventive interventions achieve positive change. This project seeks to use existing data from a landmark effectiveness trial of an evidence-based parenting intervention to determine the intervention components most functional in achieving positive outcomes. The proposed R03 project will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Develop an observational coding system capable of measuring fidelity to specific core components of the evidence-based PMTO parenting intervention; 2) Empirically determine the extent to which each observed PMTO core component is associated with changes in parenting following intervention exposure; and 3) Examine associations between observed PMTO core components and child outcomes (i.e., internalizing, externalizing) from baseline to 9-year follow-up, mediated by changes in parenting. A five-step process will be employed to systematically develop an observational coding system using video data depicting weekly PMTO parenting group sessions. Multilevel modeling will then be employed to determine the extent to which each observed PMTO core component is associated with child outcomes over time, with changes in parenting included in the model as a mediator. A better understanding of the intervention components most functional in achieving positive outcomes can advance intervention research and improve clinical practice by enabling interventions to be delivered more efficiently in real-world settings. These efforts can ultimately improve the prevention of child mental, emotional, and behavioral problems."
"9412784","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Overview: Prevalence of PGD in returning Veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation New Dawn (OND) appears to equal that of PTSD (Bolen et al., 2007). This is not altogether surprising, given that loss of life is widespread in most combat theatres. Moreover, combat Veterans experience a 'Dual Burden' of (a) loss and (b) trauma exposure (Iverson et al., 2005; Papa, Neria, & Litz, 2008) in which the potentially added negative impact of repeated significant life threat combines with loss of close attachment and support to cause impairment. Indeed, fully 21.3% of a sample of OIF/OEF Veterans reported significant difficulty coping with grief over combat death; and those who reported difficulty coping with grief were 2.4 times as likely to report health problems, and significantly more likely to report both missing work and increasing medical care use. Even more striking was the finding that effects of grief were independent of either PTSD or Depression, in that, after controlling for both PTSD and MDD, risk of reporting poor health was doubled among those reporting high grief (Toblin et al., 2012).  Unfortunately, treatments for grief in Veterans remain understudied. Our research group has recently completed pilot work on an innovative, technology-leveraged treatment protocol for PGD that combines Behavioral Activation with Therapeutic Exposure and appears readily applicable to the Veteran and Military populations. We propose to evaluate this intervention through a repeated measures randomized controlled trial design (pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3 & 6 month follow-up) in order to compare it to the treatment most commonly offered to Veterans with PGD: Cognitive Restructuring and Supportive Grief Counseling (as outlined by the VA / DoD Iraq War Clinician Guide, 2nd ed.) (Pivar, 2007). Both treatments will be delivered over 5 sessions in which sessions 2, 3, and 4 of both treatments will be delivered via televideo to Veterans' homes to increase contextual relevance of treatment components. Measures will cover clinical outcomes, process outcomes, and cost outcomes in order to assess relative effectiveness of treatment across multiple parameters. Participants will be Veterans of OIF/OEF/OND who meet PGD cutoff criteria but do not meet criteria for PTSD (as a 5 session intervention is not considered appropriate for this diagnostic group).  This study has the following Specific Aims: (1) To compare the efficacy of BATE-G vs. Cognitive Restructuring and Supportive Grief Counseling in terms of PGD and psychological outcomes in 140 OIF/OEF/OND Veterans, aged 21 years and older, who meet criteria for PGD. (2) To evaluate BATE-G with respect to its relative effects on increasing the frequency of community based reinforcing activities. (3) To evaluate BATE-G with respect to its relative effects on distal treatment targets, including perceived social support and health-related functioning.  The following are the study Hypotheses: (1) BATE-G will be more effective than Cognitive Restructuring and Supportive Grief Counseling in reducing symptoms of PGD, both at post-treatment and follow-up. Moreover, BATE-G will be more effective in reducing acute emotional distress and preventing long-term emotional distress in terms of general depression and anxiety symptoms. (2) BATE-G will result in increased frequency of completed positively reinforcing, community-based events when compared to Cognitive Restructuring and Supportive Grief Counseling. (3) BATE-G will result in greater improvements in perceived social support and health. Note: this project is the first evidence-based treatment for PGD in military populations, thus addressing a significant service gap."
"9592518","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In cerebellum-like circuits, multiple sensory and motor streams are integrated by principal cells to compare expected and actual sensory information, a process that involves transforming input signals so that they can be effectively compared. The unipolar brush cell (UBC) is a glutamatergic interneuron in cerebellum-like systems that profoundly reshapes the duration and even polarity of input signals carried by mossy fibers. UBCs make contacts onto granule cells and other UBCs. Recent work in electric fish showed that transformation by UBCs is essential for generating images of corollary discharge necessary for synaptic plasticity. In mammals, UBCs are found in vestibular cerebellum and the cerebellum-like dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), yet the function of these mammalian neurons is not clear. Our work has shown that subtypes of UBCs differ dramatically in how they alter their glutamatergic mossy fiber signals, with ON UBCs responding to glutamate with prolonged excitation and OFF UBCs responding with inhibition or profoundly delayed excitation. How these ON/OFF signals are generated requires clarifying the synaptic mechanisms of UBCs, mechanism that may be unique in the brain. Knowing the function of these cells requires defining what signals are actually carried by the diverse mossy fiber inputs to UBC subtypes. Also unknown are the actual synaptic targets of each UBC subtype and how the UBCs alters the firing patterns of those targets. This proposal answers these major questions in the field in both vestibular and auditory regions using cutting edge anatomical and electrophysiological approaches in mice."
"9398246","The delivery of healthcare in the U.S. is increasingly based on healthcare teams, with an emphasis on coordination among providers from different disciplines. Poor team functioning is associated with poor patient care through adverse events, lack of coordination, and spiraling costs. In contrast, good team functioning is associated with improved patient outcomes, heightened staff satisfaction, and reduced burnout. Within VA, teams are being used in a variety of treatment settings including primary care (e.g. Patient Aligned Care Teams) and mental health outpatient services (e.g. Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program teams [BHIPs]). Unfortunately, many healthcare teams both within and outside of VA continue to perform poorly.  What does it take to build an effective healthcare team? Numerous models suggest a set of common elements including leadership support, shared goals, and attention to communication. However, enhancing team functioning requires a significant time and resource investment?and time and resources are in short supply for many VA healthcare teams. Many studies have held up high-performing teams as examples of good teamwork?but such teams are frequently selected without regard for the baseline resources they have available. This raises the possibility that much of what we think we know about high-performing teams could be better labeled as ?what we know about well-resourced teams.? In such cases, the lessons learned may not be applicable to the lower-functioning, lower-resourced teams most in need of assistance. There is therefore an urgent need to develop concrete, actionable guidance for improving team outcomes for these teams.  Research Objectives: In the context of VA outpatient general mental health (GMH) clinics, which are in the process of implementing BHIP-based team care, we aim to refine a process for identifying teams with good staff outcomes in the context of high workload-to-staffing ratios. We will also explore the teamwork processes and contextual factors that characterize these types of high-performing teams. This mixed-methods study will therefore lay the foundation for a follow-up IIR that aims to more comprehensively identify generalizable ways for teams to achieve good staff outcomes specifically in the context of high workload-to-staffing ratios.  AIM 1: Classify VA outpatient GMH clinics as high versus low in staff outcomes (staff satisfaction, burnout, and turnover), and high versus low in workload-to-staffing ratios using existing VA data sources (the All- Employee Survey and Corporate Data Warehouse). We will contact VISN- and facility-level mental health leaders to identify outpatient BHIPs located within those clinics?two with high workload-to-staffing ratios and good staff outcomes; and two with low workload-to-staffing ratios and poor staff outcomes?in which to conduct qualitative interviews in Aim 2.  AIM 2a: Use semi-structured qualitative interviews to validate our team selection process from Aim 1.  Hypothesis 2a: We hypothesize that qualitative findings will suggest potential refinements to our team selection process undertaken in Aim 1 (specifically in terms of staff outcomes and workload-to-staffing ratios).  AIM 2b: Based on the interviews from Aim 2a, we will identify teamwork and contextual factors that most strongly differentiate these two types of teams, consistent with a Positive Deviance approach. Analyses will be pursued by Directed Content Analysis, with additional attention given to emergent themes. Outpatient BHIPs embedded within the identified outpatient GMH clinics provide an ideal environment for this aim given their interdisciplinary, heterogeneous structure; their national mandate to work together as a team; and the commitment from the Office of Mental Health Operations to enhance staff outcomes via the BHIP initiative.  Hypothesis 2b: We hypothesize that a number of teamwork elements (especially psychological safety and relational coordination) will differentiate BHIPs with good staff outcomes despite high workload-to-staffing ratios from teams with poor staff outcomes despite low workload-to-staffing ratios."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood cell production in the acute settings of trauma, surgery, sepsis, sickle cell crisis and after stem cell transplant is critical for survival and yet is often dysfunctional in those settings. We have recently used a single cell, proximity based analysis to define a distinctive mesenchymal cell subpopulation in the bone marrow that differentially expresses molecules governing hematopoietic stem and progenitor quiescence. These molecules, IL-18 and angiogenin are differentially regulated with stress and we hypothesize, participate in dysfunctional hematopoiesis. We seek to define the role of these specific molecules in models of sepsis and transplant to determine if modulating them will improve blood cell production and survival. Further, we seek to extend the advantage of defining specific subsets of marrow stromal cells more broadly and propose unbiased, single cell analytic tools to define the complexity of marrow stroma and how it may be altered in settings of stress."
"9454667","PROJECT SUMMARY Salmonella enterica is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. S. enterica causes acute gastroenteritis and is also responsible for systemic diseases that result in fatal infections. Salmonella infection presents as intestinal outgrowth, penetration of the epithelial barrier, and subsequent uptake by macrophages, where Salmonella is ultimately trafficked to secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen. S. enterica encodes two type three secretion systems encoded in the Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1 and SPI-2) that are essential for cell invasion and intracellular survival, respectively.  Regulation of virulence traits is an essential strategy for bacterial pathogens to cause disease. Ethanolamine is an abundant metabolite in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is also present in the intracellular environment. In the GI tract, the bacterial transcription factor EutR promotes expression of genes encoding ethanolamine metabolism, which enables S. enterica to utilize ethanolamine as an energy source and establish infection. During later stages of infection, EutR activates expression of SPI-2 to enhance S. enterica survival within macrophages, and thus promote dissemination. Although EutR is important for S. enterica disease progression, very little is known about EutR regulatory circuits operative during infection or how these regulatory circuits influence S. enterica interaction with the host. In Specific Aim 1, we will perform a detailed characterization of the role of EutR-dependent gene regulation in modulating host responses. In Specific Aim 2, we will elucidate EutR-regulatory circuits operative during infection that influence disease outcome. These studies are important to developing new strategies to treat infectious diseases."
"9404049","Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases represent the number one cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting a broad spectrum of ages from babies that are born with congenital heart defects (CHDs) to adults that suffer acute myocardial infarctions and/or develop congestive heart failure over time. My research program is motivated by the simple assumption that we can use the zebrafish model organism to understand on a molecular and cellular level how the cardiovascular system is established during development and how it regenerates during adulthood. Here, I plan to leverage the longer-term support and increased scientific flexibility afforded by the NHLBI R35 Emerging Investigator Award to continue and expand my laboratory?s two main research focuses in great vessel morphogenesis and heart regeneration to address significant challenges in each field. Specifically, I will use the genetic and regenerative attributes of the zebrafish system: (1) to model human CHDs that disrupt great vessel establishment and, (2) to uncover critical barriers to mammalian heart regeneration. In regards to the former, we have made paradigm-shifting observations concerning the cellular etiology of the cardiovascular phenotypes present in DiGeorge Syndrome patients that are caused by hemizygous microdeletions on chromosome 22q11.2, a region that harbors the TBX1 gene. We plan to delve deeper into these cellular mechanisms and break new ground by identifying biologically relevant targets of the Tbx1 transcriptional complex using a proprietary knock-in zebrafish strain. As ~20% of individuals carrying the 22q11.2 deletion lack any discernable pathology, we anticipate that the genes we discover as Tbx1 transcriptional targets will represent novel candidates that profoundly influence the severity of DGS cardiovascular defects. We also plan to create new CHD models in an effort to link previously identified genetic variants that segregate with great vessel CHDs in newborns to the pathology and to uncover the cellular and molecular basis of disease. The outcomes of the proposed studies will contribute significantly to our fund of knowledge and likely influence genetic counseling, pre-natal diagnosis, and possibly pre-natal repair. Additionally, we have uncovered novel determinants of myocardial proliferation in regenerating zebrafish hearts that likely contribute to the regenerative failures observed in mammalian hearts, including humans. Specifically, we plan to further explore the required role of Notch signaling in zebrafish heart regeneration, understand how alterations in the epigenetic landscape and in chromatin accessibility influence cardiomyocyte proliferation, and determine whether myocardial ploidy affects regenerative capacity. The outcomes of the proposed studies will directly guide future approaches to coax mammalian hearts towards regeneration instead of scarring and identify practical inroads for regenerative medicine. !"
"9407159","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension is a serious risk factor for myocardial infarction, heart failure, vascular disease, stroke, and renal failure. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure (BP). Recent genome wise association studies (GWAS) have shown that an A/G SNP (rs2004776) located at +1164 in intron-I of the human angiotensinogen (hAGT) gene is associated with hypertension. The nucleotide sequence of hAGT gene containing +1164A allele has stronger homology with HNF-3 binding site as compared to +1164G. HNF3 family belongs to pioneer transcription factors whose binding to promoters and enhancers enables chromatin access for other tissue-specific transcription factors. SNPs in the promoter and intron I of the hAGT gene can be divided in 2 major haplotypes: haplotype-I (containing +1164A) and II (containing +1164G). Nucleotide variants in haplotype-I bind more strongly to transcription factors as compared to haplotype-II and reporter construct containing haplotype-I has increased promoter activity as compared to haplotype-II on transient transfection. Transgenic mice containing either haplotype-I or II of the hAGT gene were generated by knock-in approach at the HPRT locus. Preliminary studies have shown that: (a) CpG dinucleotides in the hAGT promoter of TG mice containing haplotype- I are hypo-methylated and accessible to transcription factors as compared to haplotype-II, (b) male TG mice containing haplotype-I have increased basal and GR induced expression of the hAGT gene in liver, kidney and fat as compared to haplotype-II, (c) chromatin from liver and kidney of transgenic animals containing haplotype-I binds more strongly to HNF3?, C/EBP?, STAT-3 and GR as compared to haplotype-II, (d) double TG mice containing hREN gene and haplotype-I of the hAGT gene have increased BP as compared to haplotype-II which is further increased by Western diet containing high carbohydrate: high fat: high salt diet. In the present application, th role of SNP at +1164 and other cis-acting DNA elements in intron-I on transcriptional regulation of the hAGT gene will be analyzed by DNA methylation assay, chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay, ChIP assay and transient transfection assay. The effect of Western diet on the expression of the hAGT gene, blood pressure regulation, and end organ damage will be analyzed using male/female double transgenic mice containing hREN gene and either haplotype-I or haplotype-II of the hAGT gene."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is a growing global health problem that causes untold suffering for patients and their loved ones, and challenges health care systems. Motor symptoms are the classic features for which there are effective interventions; however, non-motor symptoms, especially cognitive impairment, are very common, may precede motor symptoms, and do not respond well to existing therapies. Solutions will come only from research. The Pacific Northwest Udall Center (PANUC), one of nine NINDS-funded Morris K. Udall Centers of Excellence for Parkinson's Disease Research, is our response to this research imperative. PANUC is committed to contributing to the long term, ambitious goal of developing the knowledge and tools for optimally targeted and timed interventions for cognitive impairment in PD. Our innovative three Cores and three Projects are structured around genetic risk for different types of cognitive impairment in PD. Our research focuses on molecular pathology and mechanisms of disease, investigation of neural systems using novel brain imaging, and mechanisms of balance and gait problems, in part an expression of cognitive impairment, in genetically-defined subgroups of patients with PD. Each of our research goals is ranked among the highest priority recommendations of two recent NINDS Conferences: Parkinson's Disease 2014: Advancing Research, Improving Lives and 2013 Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias: Research Challenges and Opportunities (which included PD dementia)."
"9529147","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 50-70% of Chlamydia trachomatis infections, the most common cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infections, are asymptomatic. This increases the risk of widespread transmission and untreated infections, resulting in pelvic inflammatory disease or infertility in women. Further, the CDC estimates that 10% of women between the ages of 15 to 19 test positive for Chlamydia. Hence, there is a great need to identify strategies to reduce/prevent transmission, limit infections to the primary site of inoculation or interrupt/control chlamydial growth and development. Within the host cell, elementary bodies (EBs) differentiate into reticulate bodies (RBs) in a pathogen-specified parasitic organelle termed the chlamydial inclusion. To maintain its autonomy, the chlamydial inclusion interacts with very specific host cell pathways, which ultimately influences the lipid an protein content of the inclusion. Paramount to chlamydial survival within the host is the organism's ability to obtain and utilize host cell-derived lipids. These lipids contribute to the membrane of the chlamydial inclusion, as well as, the chlamydial cell membranes. It is well established that Chlamydia will mimic the lipid composition of their host cells, but the organisms will not incorporate all available host-derived lipids into their cell membranes. During development, the RB has a close association with the inner leaflet of the chlamydial inclusion, where it acquires lipids. This is consistent with the notion that the specificity of interaction ofthe chlamydial inclusion membrane with host cell vesicles is not only important for the maintenance of the pathogen-specific parasitic organelle, but ultimately, is important for dictating the lipid content of the pathogens. Our laboratory focuses on the function of eukaryotic SNAREs at the chlamydial inclusion. SNARE proteins serve to decrease the energy required to fuse a host vesicle with a target membrane. In this case, the target membrane is the chlamydial inclusion. We have demonstrated that syntaxins 6 and 10 and VAMPs 3 and 4 localize to chlamydial inclusion. Further, we have demonstrated that syntaxin 6 and VAMP4 (2 out of 4 required proteins to form a fusogenic SNARE complex) interact at the chlamydial inclusion. We hypothesize that the chlamydial inclusion specifically intercepts multiple fusogenic SNARE complexes to create and maintain a defined lipid composition in the inclusion membrane. To test this hypothesis, first, we will identify the eukaryotic and chlamydial binding partners for SNARE proteins known to localize to the inclusion, as protein-protein interactions often dictate purpose. Second, we will knockdown these proteins to understand the role of these proteins in determining chlamydial lipid content and subsequent outer membrane organization. Third, we will determine how knockdown of these proteins affects chlamydial growth and development. By examining protein-protein interactions that occur at the chlamydial inclusion, we will determine how SNARE proteins contribute to chlamydial lipid content, and ultimately, to chlamydial pathogenesis. These studies will underlay the bases for strategies to alter chlamydial infectivity via interruption of lipid acquisition to the inclusion membrane, which will ultimately impact the infection and transmission rates of Chlamydia."
"9507607","Project Summary Collectively, the leishmaniases (cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral) afflict approximately 12 million people worldwide, mainly in regions of severe poverty. Current anti-leishmanial therapies can be costly, are often poorly tolerated and the incidence of resistant parasites is increasing. Hence, new and improved drugs are desperately needed. A better understanding of the basic biology of Leishmania would aid in the identification of differences between the parasite and its host that are potentially exploitable for drug development. To this end, we propose to develop and validate a suite of novel tools that will facilitate the analysis of protein function, localization, and regulation in these parasites. The proposed tools are designed to exploit the ability of virally derived 2A peptide sequences to mediate the formation of two polypeptides from a single open reading frame (ORF) via a cotranslational, intra-ribosomal ?cleavage? mechanism. All of these tools will be used to create gene targeting constructs that encode an in-frame genetic fusion between a drug marker, a short 2A peptide sequence linker, and a tagged gene of interest. This will allow integration of the tagged gene into its endogenous chromosomal locus by selecting for drug resistance. Although encoded within the same ORF, cotranslational cleavage mediated by the 2A-peptide sequence will cause the drug marker and protein of interest to be expressed as separate proteins. Tools following this general principle will be created to address two problems. First, traditional systems for expressing tagged proteins in Leishmania can provide unregulated, non-physiological, and often heterogeneous expression. The proposed ?2A-tagging cassettes? will overcome these issues by facilitating integration of a tagged gene at its endogenous locus in a manner that preserves the cognate 5' and 3' flanking sequencing, and potentially maintains normal expression and regulation. We will generate and validate 2A-tagging cassettes encoding 3XHA, GFP, HB tandem affinity tags, DD-FKBP and ltDHFR inducible destabilizing domains, and two different drug markers. Second, commonly used methods for distinguishing between translational and post-translational regulatory mechanisms are cumbersome to apply, particularly to multiple candidates such as those derived from global proteomic studies. We will develop and validate a novel reporter system, employing ?2A-reporter cassettes?, that will allow the contributions of translational and post-translational mechanisms to be readily discerned. Because 2A peptide sequences are functional in every eukaryote yet tested, the 2A-reporter concept will have broad applicability and impact. The modular design of these tools is compatible with our published method for rapidly generating gene targeting vectors, increasing the speed and throughput of the system. Published data support the principles behind both the tagging and reporter systems, making it highly likely that successful completion of the specific aims in this proposal will provide the community with a set of versatile and valuable new tools."

"9404472","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although numerous genetic loci have been associated with complex human disease through genome wide association studies (GWAS), further efforts are required to understand the mechanisms of association and thus disease risk. We need to understand how causal variation regulates expression of causal genes, and increasingly findings point to the interaction of cis- and trans-acting transcriptional mechanisms in this regard. These observations, and the apparent clustering of disease associated variation in transcriptional networks, have led us to study the transcription factors (TFs) associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), and in particular the bHLH factor TCF21. We have identified this TF, which is involved in vascular smooth muscle biology, as the causal gene at 6q23.2, and shown that it binds in target regions that are highly enriched among those identified by GWAS to be CAD associated, commonly in linkage disequilibrium with causal variants. This enrichment suggests that TCF21 mediates its effect on disease risk at least in part through regulation of expression of other CAD associated genes, and by inference these genes may also be involved in vascular wall related biology. TCF21 thus provides an exemplary model to explore cis- and trans-acting transcriptional interactions in highly relevant CAD loci. We thus propose our Central hypothesis: In CAD loci where the CAD causal variant (CCV) mediates TF binding, these TFs interact directly with TCF21 to regulate causal gene expression. In loci where the CCV is not located in a consensus TF binding motif, the causal variant indirectly regulates TCF21 binding and its mediated effects on chromatin structure and gene expression. In studies proposed here we aim to investigate in greater detail the mechanisms by which causal variation in CAD GWAS loci regulates TCF21 binding and gene expression. For CCVs located in TF binding motifs, studies in Aim 1 will determine whether the CCV related TFs regulate TCF21 binding by cooperative interaction or modulation of chromatin state or accessibility. In Aim 2, to study causal variants that do not reside in TF binding sites, we will map genome-wide quantitative trait variation that regulates TCF21 binding, H3K27Ac status, and chromatin accessibility. With these data, we will determine whether this type of disease variation indirectly mediates TCF21 binding through regulation of basic local chromatin availability. In Aim3 we will map chromosomal looping mediated by TCF21-DNA interactions with ChIA-PET, and use 3C to investigate the allelic effects of CCVs on these TCF21 mediated chromosomal structures in target CAD loci. Findings from these studies will vertically advance understanding of mechanisms by which causal variation mediates risk for CAD and other complex human diseases, bridging the gap between fundamental observations on regulatory variation and disease associations."
"9544547","Project Summary Annual immunization against in?uenza infection is one of the largest coordinated international public health ef- forts. Current in?uenza vaccination strategies elicit protection primarily through the generation of long lasting, type-speci?c, neutralizing anti-HA IgG antibodies. A major reason for the success of the seasonal in?uenza vac- cination is that it induces antibodies that bind to molecularly similar in?uenza subtypes. However, we currently lack both high throughput assays and multidimensional analytic methods to rapidly characterize comprehensive individual and population level IgG mediated immunity to a broad range of in?uenza strains, or to predict popula- tion immunity against new strains. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop an innovative multidimensional assay and quantitative modeling framework to characterize population level immunity to a large number of in- ?uenza strains, and predict responses to new in?uenza vaccines. In Aim 1, we will use a novel multiplex assay to measure pre-and post- vaccine anti-HA IgG reactivity against 50 in?uenza strains in 150 subjects. We then will test and validate a predictive model for vaccine induced changes in anti-HA IgG levels. In Aim 2 we will use the data from Aim 1 to estimate changes in population immunity pre- and post-standard seasonal in?uenza vacci- nation. Multidimensional scaling will be used to develop functional immune repertoire cartography, quantitatively modeling both the similarity of subject immune states and a model of vaccine-induced changes in the anti-HA IgG repertoire vector. Successful completion of these Aims will establish a new hybrid experimental-modeling method for predicting in?uenza vaccine responses and estimating population resistance to emerging in?uenza strains."
"9412183","Project Summary  Vascular homeostasis plays an important role in maintenance of normal vessel and organ function. Recent studies from our and other laboratories have established that continuous endothelial fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling input is critical for the maintenance of vascular integrity, permeability and cell fate. One particularly important consequence of the loss of FGF input is the development of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) that represents a fate transition from endothelial to a mesenchymal-like (smooth muscle cell (SMC), fibroblast) phenotype. Induced by chronic inflammation and other poorly understood stimuli, EndMT leads to formation of neointima that consists of a combination of different cell types, SMCs, fibroblasts and various inflammatory cells as well as remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM).  We have observed extensive EndMT in atherosclerotic coronary arteries in patients and in mouse atherosclerosis. These data suggest that EndMT may make a major contribution to disease progression in illnesses associated with chronic inflammation, such as atherosclerosis, and transplant arteriopathy. If correct, this hypothesis would open a possibility to fundamentally change the natural history of these illnesses with considerable clinical impact.  To this end, we aim to test whether suppression of EndMT will inhibit will inhibit initiation, progression and regression of atherosclerotic lesions, and to unravel the signaling and gene expression pathways that connect EndMT, ECM remodeling and inflammation that mediate these effects."
"9407790","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transport of gases across cell membranes is one of the most fundamental of physiological processes-O2 for oxidative metabolism, CO2 for acid-base balance, and NH3 for waste disposal. CO2 retention and hyperammonemia are key components of diseases that are major public health concerns. The traditional dogma had been that all gases cross all cell membranes by diffusing through membrane lipid. However, some membranes are gas impermeable and require protein 'gas channels' such as the aquaporins AQP1 (abundant in red blood cells) and AQP5 (abundant in airway epithelia) to conduct gases such as CO2 and NH3. Movement of these gases through AQPs results in a disturbance of pH in microdomains around the channels that we can measure using a pH microelectrode. However, the mechanism of gas conduction is poorly understood. Molecular dynamic simulations, measurements of the pH beneath an electrode touching the surface (pHS) of a model spherical cell (Xenopus oocytes), as well as a mathematical model addressing these pHS changes have provided the first insights into CO2 and NH3 movement through channels. However, a fundamental understanding of such movements across cell membranes requires more advanced multi-scale mathematical models (microscopic, mesoscopic, sub-macroscopic and macroscopic) in order to elucidate mechanisms of gas permeation in normal and pathological states. The PIs (Drs. Boron, Somersalo, and Tajkhorshid) propose to combine state-of-the-art molecular dynamic simulations and computational modeling with novel experimental studies to develop a predictive mathematical model for permeation of various gases across diverse cell membranes of different protein composition, based on integration of data from complementary methodologies across a range of spatial and temporal scales. We will run molecular dynamic simulations of NH3 and CO2 passage through wild-type, mutant, chemically modified, and metal-bound aquaporins in Aim 1 to predict single channel permeabilities (microscopic scale) that will inform the modeling in Aim 2 and cell physiology in Aim 3. In Aim 2, we will create new computational models of gas transport through single and multiple aquaporins in a lipid bilayer (mesoscopic scale), beneath the pHS electrode (sub-macroscopic scale) and in the whole cell (macroscopic scale). Finally in Aim 3, informed by Aims 1 and 2, we will validate the simulations and models in oocytes using electrophysiological and optical methods."

Infection can cause flu-like symptoms, and severe infection can be fatal, in particular in the immunosuppressed and the elderly. Current methods for babesiosis diagnosis include microscopy, PCR, IFA and ELISA-based methods that detect antibodies in serum from patients or donors. Each of these methods has major limitations. PCR detection of the parasite DNA is the most sensitive of all current diagnostic methods used. However, PCR only tests for the presence of parasites within a fraction of a sample being tested (typically 1ml out of 500 ml). Thus, at very low parasitemias, a false negative result is possible when the test sample happens to be devoid of infected red blood cells. In sum, current screening criteria reduce the probability of blood contamination but do not completely eliminate the risk of transmission by transfusion to individuals with a weakened immune system. Here we propose to develop a capture ELISA assay that can detect the most highly expressed and immunogenic antigen of the parasite, BmGPI12/BmSA1. Our preliminary studies using short-term in vitro culture as well as controlled mouse infections demonstrated that a capture assay targeting this antigen detects infection before the parasite is detectable by microscopy or PCR, with parasitemia levels lower than 0.067%. Because each infected cell releases thousands of BmGPI12/BmSA1 molecules into the serum, we expect that our antigen detection assay will prove more sensitive than any method detecting the parasite itself, including PCR. Building upon our preliminary data, we propose the following two specific aims towards the development of a test that could be implemented for high-throughput detection of B. microti in blood donations. In Aim 1, we will optimize the assay procedure using a set of well-characterized blood and sera from infected and non-infected laboratory mice. To achieve regulatory standards of reproducibility in a commercial assay, we will develop monoclonal antibodies against BmGPI12/BmSA1 to replace the polyclonal serum used in preliminary experiments. In Aim 2, we will use the optimized assay to screen a collection of 100 human serum samples available at Yale University and L2 Diagnostics. These samples have previously been characterized by B. microti PCR detection and serology. Our experiments will provide proof of feasibility needed for future efforts and collaborations with major blood organizations to use the assay in large scale blood screening. The success of the proposed studies will set the stage for use of this assay to screen the blood supply to prevent transfusion-transmitted babesiosis."
"9466396","Boothman, DA Abstract In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), >80% tumors have elevated NQO1 levels 5- to 200-fold above associated normal tissues, while Catalase levels are expressed at extremely low levels in NSCLCs compared to all normal tissue in the body. We showed that unique and novel NQO1 bioactivatable drugs, ß-lapachone (ARQ761 in clinical trials) and a new drug, isobutyldeoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ), are `bioactivated' by NQO1, resulting in massive H2O2-induced, apyrimidinic/apurinic (AP) site- and DNA single-strand break-mediated hyperactivation of poly(ADP- ribosyl) polymerase 1 (PARP1) that causes dramatic NAD+/ATP losses. ß-Lapachone is also an excellent radiosensitizer against cancer cells overexpressing NQO1. We hypothesize that exposure of NQO1+ NSCLC cancers with low dose ionizing radiation (IR), followed immediately with nontoxic NQO1 bioactivatable drugs (ß-lapachone or IB-DNQ for 2 h) will cause an elevated level of DNA lesions that hyperactivate PARP activity in cells that over-express NQO1. Low doses of IR or ß- lapachone, which are not able alone to cause a significant level of DNA lesions to hyperactivate PARP, will be used together. Since IR causes DSBs that are quickly repaired, this agent must be delivered before or at the same time as NQO1 bioactivatable drugs,18,19 which then must be applied for at least 2 h for maximal DNA lesion formation, PARP hyperactivation and metabolic alterations7,8,12 that inhibit DSB repair and cause synergistic lethality of NQO1+ NSCLC cells. Three aims will be performed: Aim 1: To define DNA repair inhibitory effects (on homologous recombination (HR) and non- homologous end joining (NHEJ)) after IR + ß-lapachone. (Yrs 0-5). Premise: Nonlethal, low doses of IR or ß-lap can be used to cause DSBs and PARP hyperactivation that depletes NAD+/ATP levels and inhibits DSB repair (NHEJ and HR) to enhance efficacy against NSCLC. Aim 2: To define the inhibition of carbon metabolism (glycolytic and TCA cycle inhibition due to NAD+/ATP losses) after IR + ß-lapachone (Yrs 0-5). Premise: PARP hyperactivation causes dramatic NAD+/ATP losses that greatly suppress glycolysis (via GAPDH inhibition) and TCA cycling by LDH inhibition and other NAD(P)H-dependent pathways to maximize efficacy against NQO1+ NSCLC. Aim 3: To elucidate the most efficacious use of IR + NQO1 bioactivatable drug combination against NQO1+ NSCLCs. (Yrs 0-5). Premise: IR + NQO1 bioactivatable drugs will induce DSBs + DNA lesions that hyperactivate PARP, lead to dramatic NAD+/ATP losses, inhibit DSB repair, greatly suppress glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolism that induces tumor-selective programmed necrosis. An outstanding research team will explore the effects of IR + NQO1 bioactivatable drugs on DSB repair, metabolism and efficacy against NSCLC xenograft models, leading to a clinical trial in 3-5 years."
"9395895","Mitochondria-dependent apoptosis is a major cell death pathway necessary for ensuring normal development and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Abnormal blockade of this pathway is required for tumor formation and cancer metastasis. On the other hand, the core machinery in this pathway is required for the actions of many cancer therapeutics. The Bcl-2 family proteins, including the anti-apoptotic members, the effectors (Bax and Bak), and the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, are the major regulators and effectors of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a central control point leading to apoptosis. Through biochemical and genetic studies, it has been established that Bax and Bak are two essential effectors of MOMP, and are activated during apoptosis. The mechanism of Bax/Bak activation has been considered the life-to-death switch of the cell, and has been intensively investigated in the past two decades. Recently, an overwhelming consensus has been reached to support the Direct Activation model, in which Bax/Bak activation is primarily triggered by three ?direct activator? BH3-only proteins, Bid, Bim, and Puma, which transiently engage and attack Bax/Bak during apoptosis. However, in our preliminary studies, we found that none of these three proteins are necessary for the activation of Bax/Bak and apoptosis once the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are suppressed. As these results are incompatible with the Direct Activation model, we propose to examine the mechanism of Bax/Bak activation in the absence of Bid, Bim, and Puma. We hypothesize that the direct activation activities of all putative direct activator BH3-only proteins are not necessary for Bax/Bak activation. Following a BH3-only protein-mediated neutralization of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, Bax/Bak activation occurs spontaneously. In addition, Bid, Bim, Puma or p53 may have a modulatory function in accelerating Bax/Bak activation following neutralization of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Using genetics, cell biology, and biochemical interaction studies, the following three specific Aims are proposed to investigate the mechanism of Bax/Bak activation without Bid, Bim, and Puma. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of Bid, Bim, Puma, and p53 in the kinetics of Bax/Bak activation after neutralization of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. In Aim 2, we will examine the involvement Bik, Bmf, Noxa, and Hrk in Bid/Bim/Puma-independent Bax/Bak activation. Overall, we propose to investigate the mechanism of Bax/Bak activation in the absence of Bid, Bim, and Puma following neutralization of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in cancer cells. Results from the proposed studies should either significantly modify the current model, or provide critical clues to novel and physiologically relevant models of Bax/Bak activation."
"9413379","The mitochondrial dynamism/fitness/biogenesis interactome in cardiac disease Dorn GW II Abstract  Cardiomyocyte mitochondria are essential providers of ATP that fuels contraction and normal or reparative cardiomyocyte growth. Observationally, cardiomyocyte utilization of metabolic substrates evolves during cardiac development from a fetal preference for carbohydrates to the normal adult preference for fatty acids. In adult hearts, pathological reversion toward mitochondrial utilization of carbohydrates is postulated to contribute to cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and myocardial infarction. However, our grasp of specific mechanisms that direct cardiac substrate utilization is incomplete, and forced genetic production of cardiomyocyte mitochondria has not proven therapeutic in experimental models of heart disease.  Our conceptual breakthrough was that cardiac metabolism is not determined by a ?master regulator?, but is directed by the interplay between mitochondrial dynamism, fitness and biogenesis. We posit that myocardial metabolic remodeling requires coordinated modulation of mitophagic mitochondrial removal, biogenic mitochondrial replacement and fusion/fission-mediated mitochondrial redistribution. By individually disrupting these pathways and defining the consequences on mitochondrial, cell and organ functioning we determined how these three processes are co-regulated and functionally-interdependent, therein defining a central role for Mfn2 as orchestrator of mitochondrial fate (i.e. retention vs removal). By engineering artificial Mfn2 mutations and studying damaging human Mfn2 mutations identified through DNA sequencing of cardiomyopathy cohorts we are learning how each major process within the interactome is internally fine-tuned through modulation of functionally opposing pairs. Specifically, Mfn-mediated mitochondrial fusion is opposed by Drp1- mediated mitochondrial fission; PGC1-mediated biogenesis of fatty acid-catabolizing mitochondria is opposed by PRC-mediated biogenesis of carbohydrate-catabolizing mitochondria; and mitochondrial replication is opposed by Parkin-mediated mitochondrial elimination. Based on these insights, which represent a convergence of the research aims of HL59888 (mito fusion) and HL128441 (mitophagy), we developed novel genetic and biochemical tools, namely Separation-of-Function mutant Mfn2 proteins and cell-permeant peptides, to specifically manipulate mitochondrial dynamism or mitophagy in vitro and in vivo. We will employ these new concepts and reagents to dissect the molecular mechanisms that drive metabolic remodeling in normal and diseased hearts, and to develop translatable means of optimally matching cardiac metabolism to pathophysiological status by ?dialing- in? mitochondrial quality and quantity via precision manipulations within the interactome."

Dr. Ow has devoted his early research career to the study of factors associated with locoregional treatment failure in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This research addresses a major unmet need for the current diagnosis and management of patients with HNSCC. The research builds on Dr. Ow?s previous work, and proposes to use both clinical and laboratory research to examine the relationship between key genetic and molecular characteristics (TP53 mutation, p16INK4A/p14ARF expression, and BCL-family pro-survival molecule expression) of HNSCC and tumor cell resistance to cisplatin and radiation. The career development plan, through mentorship and formal training activities, builds on Dr. Ow?s previous training in laboratory methods, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and translational research methods. Upon completion of the K23 funding period, it is anticipated that Dr. Ow will be well-positioned to submit a Research Project Grant (RO1).  Dr. Ow?s mentorship and advisory teams are composed of individuals who have had great success in all aspects of translational research, and will help Dr. Ow develop core skills necessary to carry out independent T1 translational research. Dr. Chandan Guha, MBBS, PhD, a radiation oncologist and translational scientist, will serve as primary mentor, while Mimi Kim, ScD (Biostatistics), Evripidis Gavathiotis, PhD (Biochemistry), and Nicolas Schlecht (Epidemiology) form a strong mentorship committee, each providing expertise in disciplines that are fundamental to the proposed research plan and translational science. Dr. Ow receives protected time, laboratory space, salary for a full-time research technician, supplies, and administrative support from the Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (Primary Appointment) and from the Department of Pathology (Secondary Appointment).

"9405929","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hippocampal formation is critical for the formation and retrieval of autobiographical memories, which consist of information about what happened when and where. It is known how objects, context and space (what, where) are represented in the hippocampus and it has recently been described that time (when events occur) on a scale of seconds to minutes is represented by the sequential activation of hippocampal cells. On a longer time scale, a time-varying neural code has previously been shown by theoretical models to be suitable for estimating the recency of a remembered event. In recently published results and results presented as preliminary data, we identify a novel, time-varying hippocampal neural code that can represent how long ago an event occurred on a time scale of hours and days. Our data first identified that the neuronal firing patterns of CA1 cells are characterized by a monotonic accumulation of rate differences as a function of time between experiences. However, we demonstrate that stored information does not simply deteriorate in the CA1 area, but that the code for time can co-exist with reliable coding for other aspects of an event, such as the spatial location or the context. We also found that CA3 contains an exquisitely precise code for context and space that does not vary over time. New preliminary data show an effect in CA2 that is opposite of CA3. CA2 cells represent elapsed time but no information about context. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the neuronal code for extended time is combined with spatial and contextual information in the CA1 cell population to guide behavior in which the recency of a previous event is remembered. Using a combination of behavioral testing and single-unit recordings in awake behaving rodents, this hypothesis is tested in three aims that: (1) determine whether the neuronal code for extended time intervals is generated in the hippocampal CA2 neural network, (2) determine whether the input from the hippocampal CA3 subregion is necessary for maintaining the stable memory coding component in the CA1 neural network over hours and days, and (3) determine whether a time-varying neural code in hippocampal CA1 and CA2 subregions is correlated with remembering how long ago. The first two aims address how different subregions contribute to the time-varying and stable components of the neural code. In addition to defining the function of CA2 for temporal coding and the function of CA3 in enabling stable memory representations, we will also ask whether the entorhinal cortex can represent time on an extended scale and is thus a brain region in which temporal coding over a large range of scales can be found. In the third aim, we will use a behavioral task in which it has been shown that rats remember how long ago over extended time periods. We will measure the similarity of activity patterns in place cell populations between two time points and determine whether the change in neuronal firing patterns corresponds to the rat's estimate of elapsed time. Taken together, these studies will be important for understanding the neural network mechanisms for long-term memory stability and temporal event coding in the brain structures that support episodic memory. Understanding the key mechanisms for memory processing will guide efforts to repair circuit dysfunction in psychiatric, neurological, and neurodegenerative diseases."
"9416106","More than 1/3 of the world?s population is anemic, making the process of erythropoiesis central to human health and disease. The maturation of a committed erythroid progenitor to a functional erythrocyte is characterized by a global decline in transcription and progressive chromatin condensation that ultimately culminates in enucleation. Although these processes occur in parallel, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate them are unknown. We hypothesize that Setd8 is a critical regulator of mammalian erythropoiesis that functions to coordinate the fundamental processes of transcriptional repression and chromatin condensation. Setd8 is the sole enzyme in mammals capable of mono-methylating H4K20 (H4K20me1), and is expressed at significantly higher levels in CD71+ erythroid cells than in any other cell- or tissue-type. In addition, Setd8 has functions that are independent of its methyltransferase activity. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of Setd8 in the regulation of mammalian erythropoiesis. Data from our laboratory demonstrates that conditional erythroid Setd8 deletion results in severe defects in primitive erythropoiesis, with visible anemia at E9.5 and death from anemia by ~E12.5. Erythroblasts from these embryos fail to undergo the typical semi-synchronous maturation observed in erythroblasts from control embryos and have a profound defect in nuclear condensation. The goal of Aim 1 is to delineate the function of Setd8 during mammalian erythropoiesis. In Aim 1, in vivo analyses of conditional Setd8 disruption will be coupled with knockdown of Setd8 in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to gain a comprehensive understanding of the function of Setd8 in mammalian erythropoiesis. Preliminary data from our laboratory further demonstrates that Setd8 functions as a transcriptional repressor in erythroid cells, and that the Gata2 locus is a direct Setd8 target. Knockdown of Setd8 leads to increased Gata2 expression, with loss of H4K20me1 and increased H4Acetylation in the Gata2 locus. Although Gata2 is a key regulator of erythroid differentiation, Gata2 overexpression alone does not account for the severity of the Setd8 phenotype, especially the profound impairment in nuclear condensation. The Condensin II complex recognizes H4K20me1 and mediates both transcriptional repression and higher order chromatin condensation. Interestingly, Setd8 and a member of the Condensin II complex co-occupy key regulatory regions of the Gata2 locus. The goal of Aim 2 is to delineate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the role of Setd8 in erythropoiesis. In Aim 2 we will determine the mechanisms by which Setd8 regulates key erythroid loci, and the degree to which the Setd8-H4K20me1-Condensin II pathway mediates transcriptional repression and chromatin condensation in erythroid cells. Taken together, the studies in this proposal will delineate the function of a novel regulator of erythropoiesis and provide critical insights into pathways involved in both inherited and acquired human disease."
"9434292","Several arenaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) disease in humans and pose a serious public health problem in their endemic regions. Thus, Lassa virus (LASV) infects several hundred thousand individuals yearly in West Africa resulting in a high number of Lassa fever (LF) cases associated with high morbidity and mortality. Notably, increased traveling has led to the importation of LF cases into non-endemic metropolitan areas around the globe. Besides their impact in public health, several arenaviruses, including LASV, have features that make them a credible biodefense threat. There are no FDA-licensed vaccines to combat arenavirus infections and current anti-arenaviral therapy is limited to the off-label use of ribavirin, which is only partially effective and associated with side effects. The significance of arenaviruses, including LASV, in human health and biodefense readiness, together with the limited existing armamentarium to combat their infections, highlight the importance of developing effective vaccines to combat arenavirus induced disease in humans. The central goal of this application is to test the novel hypothesis that a codon deoptimized (CD)-based strategy can be used for the development of a safe, immunogenic, stable and protective live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) to combat HF disease caused by LASV infection. Moreover, we also hypothesize that a recombinant LASV expressing a codon deoptimized (CD) glycoprotein (GP), rLASV/GPCD, will prove investigators with a valid LASV surrogate that could be safely used in BSL2 facilities to facilitate the investigation of LASV-host cell interactions as well as the identification and characterization of anti- LASV candidate therapeutics without the need of BSL4 containment, currently needed to work with live forms of this important human biodefense pathogen. The bases for our hypothesis are: 1) Existing evidence that CD can be used to generate attenuated viruses, including arenaviruses, that are able to provide protection against a challenge with wild-type (WT) virus. 2) CD LAV have identical immunogenic properties than WT virus, but the large number (>100s) of silent mutations within the genome of CD LAV makes impossible its reversion to a virulent strain. 3) CD LAV, including arenaviruses, are able to grow to high titers, compatible with vaccine production, in FDA-approved Vero cells for vaccine production. 4) Generation of CD recombinant LASV can be rapidly achieved using our state-of-the-art reverse genetics technologies. To test our hypothesis, we will first use the prototypic LCMV system that provides us with an excellent reference virus that can be safely used in BSL2 facilities to test whether a CD LASV GP can convert a virulent strain into an attenuated (Aim 1) and stable (Aim 2) form still able to induce protective immunity (Aim 3) using the well characterized mouse model of LCMV infection. We will use this knowledge to generate a rLASV/GPCD whose potential as LAV will be evaluated using the well-established guinea pig model of LF disease (Aim 4)."
"9452284","Abstract Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) successfully reduces distress and pain, and improves psychological functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with chronic conditions such as cancer. MBSR interventions have also been efficacious at promoting the uptake and adherence of health behaviors. Patients living with chronic conditions such as cancer are recommended to adhere to long-term oral, anti-cancer medication regimens in order to prevent disease progression or recurrence. However, persistent side effects (e.g., fatigue, mood & sleep disturbance, vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes, arthralgia, vaginal dryness) from oral medication regimens such as endocrine therapy (ET) for breast cancer interfere with optimal adherence to the medication. Despite the benefits of ET, documented non-adherence rates to ET range from 47% to 73%. Although there is a growing literature documenting the efficacy of MBSR on reducing the very same symptoms that interfere with optimal adherence to ET in breast cancer, no study has investigated the utility of MBSR in improving optimal adherence to life-saving oral medications via reductions in medication-related side effects and improvement in HRQoL. We have a unique opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of interventions such as MBSR in improving adherence to life-saving oral medications that have high rates of non-adherence. We propose to establish the feasibility of a web-delivered, group-based MBSR program to improve adherence to oral medication?a NCCIH high priority research topic. This is the critical first step to develop a pragmatic, scalable and accessible web-based MBSR to increase adherence to ET. Our primary outcome will be feasibility (i.e., acceptability, demand, practicality, intended limited effects) of a group, web-based MBSR program. We will also assess variability in medication adherence, ET side effects, and HRQoL as secondary outcomes as these factors may explain the effect of MBSR on adherence to ET. Our aims are 1) Develop an MBSR plus education for ET side effects condition (MBSR + ET education) and an attention-matched health plus ET education condition (health + ET education) for managing ET side effects, 2) finalize our protocol for objectively assessing adherence to ET (i.e., electronic monitoring of ET & pharmaceutical record extraction), 3) conduct usability testing with a sample of participants (N=15) on our web-delivered, group-based MBSR intervention platform to refine and finalize the web-based platform, and 4) establish the feasibility of our MBSR intervention to improve medication adherence project by implementing our study procedures and conditions (MBSR + ET education vs. health + ET education). Breast cancer survivors (N = 80) will be randomized to the conditions (MBSR + ET education n = 40; health + ET education n = 40). We hypothesize that the MBSR + ET education will have higher feasibility outcomes (i.e., acceptability, demand, practicality, limited efficacy) than the control condition due to the inclusionof MBSR self-management content and training skills."
"9607689","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral malaria is the deadliest form of malaria, potentially killing half of its victims-primarily children in sub- Saharan Africa. However, most children in malaria-endemic regions appear to develop immunity to severe malaria early in life, a phenomenon that correlates with the production of antibodies to malaria parasite antigens that are expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes. These variant surface antigens (VSAs) are the most polymorphic families within the parasite genome: Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane proteins (PfEMP1), repetitive interspersed family proteins (RIFINs) and the sub-telomeric variable open reading frame proteins (STEVORs). Each malaria genome has hundreds of genes encoding these diverse parasite surface antigens, of which only a small subset are expressed on the surface of a given infected erythrocyte. If a subset of VSAs is specific to cerebral malaria, they would be an important target for a malaria vaccine to protect children and travelers from the deadliest consequences of malaria. Work at our field site in rural Mali suggests that malaria parasites express a stealth subgroup of these parasite surface antigens more commonly in cerebral malaria than in milder forms of malaria. Our overall goals are to determine the VSA contribution to the pathophysiology of cerebral malaria and the importance of an individual's development of antibodies to VSAs in the acquisition of immunity to cerebral malaria. This project combines novel genomic and proteomic approaches with the use of a new animal model to measure the association between particular variant surface antigens and the development of cerebral malaria and also protective natural immunity. We will determine the genetic sequences of VSAs in cerebral malaria infections and in matched uncomplicated malaria controls in a cerebral malaria case-control study and ascertain which VSAs are found on the surface on infected erythrocytes (Aim 1). Mice will be infected with these field-derived parasites and the microvascular pathophysiological effects will be identified in the brain, including associations with expressed VSAs (Aim 2). Multiple VSA fragments will be encoded onto microarray chips, which will then be exposed to patients' sera to study antibody interactions with all of these proteins at once (Aim 3). This project introduces cutting-edge research techniques-some from outside the malaria research community-including next-generation sequencing, custom microarrays, proteomics, and a promising new animal model, to advance our understanding of cerebral malaria and the development of a cerebral malaria vaccine."
"9412090","PROJECT ABSTRACT  Retroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that cause cancers and immunodeficiency diseases in humans and animals. Our laboratory studies Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), an avian retrovirus that causes solid tumors in domesticated fowl, as a model for dissecting the molecular underpinnings of retroviral assembly. Our discovery that the RSV structural protein Gag transiently travels through the nucleus in a Crm1-dependent fashion challenged the traditional view of retroviral assembly. Treatment with a Crm1 inhibitor or mutation of the nuclear export signal (NES) effectively traps RSV Gag in the nucleus, allowing us to further study the role of Gag in the nucleus. Recent studies have revealed additional retroviral Gag proteins that undergo nuclear localization, suggesting there may be common functions of Gag within the nucleus.  Retroviruses are unique in that they package two copies of their genome as non-covalently linked genomic RNA dimers. Genome dimerization is facilitated by cis-acting sequences located in the 5?UTR of the viral RNA. Dimerization of the genome is conserved in orthoretroviruses and is required for viral replication. Despite its critical importance in replication, the mechanisms underlying genome dimerization within infected cells remains poorly understood. RSV affords a unique opportunity to investigate genome dimerization using our extensive toolbox of genetic, biochemical and imaging methods because we can readily manipulate the subcellular localization of Gag with our well-characterized collection of viral mutants. In recent work, we have developed methods to visualize fluorophore-tagged RSV Gag proteins co-localized with viral genomic RNA in the cell. Our experiments suggest nuclear trafficking of Gag is required for the efficient packaging of retroviral genomic RNA. This proposal thus aims to understand the mechanism governing genome dimerization in RSV, and we will test the hypothesis that nuclear trafficking of Gag plays a role in facilitating genome dimerization.  In these studies, we will utilize the MS2 and Bgl RNA labeling system to visualize two distinct viral RNA populations to examine genome dimerization. This approach will allow us to determine the subcellular location of dimerization; whether there is preferential formation of heterodimers, which contain two genetically distinct viral genomes, or homodimers, composed of two identical viral genomes; and whether dimerization occurs in a co-transcriptional manner. We will also examine the role of nuclear Gag in genome dimerization and determine whether RSV Gag initially binds monomers or dimers. Studies that express the viral RNA and Gag in trans will investigate whether Gag facilitates genome dimerization within different compartments of the cell. The findings from this proposal will greatly contribute to the understanding of this critical step in the replication cycle and may provide support for future anti-retroviral therapeutics. Overall, this program is designed to provide a comprehensive experience consisting of opportunities in laboratory-based research, scientific career development, educational seminars, and mentoring to advance physician-scientist training."
"9412866","Abstract Atypical speech rhythms, like those observed in children with childhood apraxia of speech, autism spectrum disorders, and stuttering, limit social interactions and can impede normal development and cognitive functioning. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to provide a developmentally sensitive model of language production that explains the emergence of typical and atypical speech rhythms. Current models of production are based on sophisticated descriptions of adult language. Influences from slowly developing speech motor, language, and other cognitive skills on speech plan representations and production processes have rarely been investigated. The paucity of research on such influences leads to fundamental gaps in understanding typical and atypical rhythm development, including understanding why young school-aged children do not chunk grammatical words with content words in connected speech to the same extent as adults. This chunking is important because it yields the rhythms we associate with prosodic words in adult language. The proposed research will investigate age-related changes in grammatical word production in typical development to explain prosodic word acquisition. The working hypothesis is that, once lexical stress is acquired, adult-like English rhythm production depends on a meaning- based chunking process at the intonational phrase level. The chunks evolve over developmental time into the supralexical production units we hear as prosodic words. We will test this hypothesis against well-defined alternatives using long-distance coarticulation to index production units. English-speaking school-aged children (5 and 8 years old) and adults will produce sentences designed to elicit either anticipatory or perseveratory lip rounding at different distances from a target content-word vowel. Metrical contexts will also be varied, and children's linguistic and cognitive development independently assessed. An audio-visual gating paradigm will be used to test for coarticulatory onset/offset at specific phonological and temporal locations. Perceiver agreement and acoustic measures will be used to gauge coarticulatory strength. The influence of specific linguistic and cognitive factors on the development of long-distance coarticulation will also be investigated. In all, the proposed research will accomplish 3 specific practical aims. It will (1) identify the scope of ?look ahead? in children's speech and factors influencing the development of anticipatory coarticulation across word junctures; (2) measure the strength of perseveratory and anticipatory coarticulation on grammatical word production across different metrical contexts and ages; and (3) assess the effect of long-distance coarticulation versus other factors on the perceptual coherence of grammatical-content word sequences. The results will inform theory and provide new insights into why speech rhythm is atypical in children with speech planning deficits. The research will also provide important normative data on the extent and strength of long-distance coarticulation in school-aged children's speech, and fundamental information about language and speech interactions in typical development. Finally, it will determine which cues most influence the perception of immature speech rhythm, with implications for clinical intervention."
"9406325","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-oriented research of infections in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) provides the opportunity to directly affect outcome of HCT recipients. Infections continue to be a major cause of morbidity and death after HCT. This award renewal will provide protected time for the applicant to mentor trainees in clinical research that is directly related to understanding the biology of infections after HCT. Results wil provide the basis for translation into improved management strategies. This proposal will address four areas of transplant infectious diseases: respiratory virus infections, genetics of infections, the microbiome, and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV- 6) disease manifestations. The Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1. To investigate clinical, host and viral factors affecting advers outcomes in HCT recipients with human rhinovirus (HRV) infection, which is now the significant cause of upper and lower respiratory tract disease after HCT. In large cohort study (N=1750) we will define risk factors for progression from upper to lower respiratory tract disease (LRD). We will also examine the role of host responses (cytokines, gene expression profiles) in patients with HRV and correlate with clinical symptoms and outcomes (progression, mortality), and determine the impact of viral load, strain differences and viral shedding on disease progression, morbidity, and mortality. Specific Aim 2. To determine the impact of donor and recipient innate genetic factors on the risk and outcome of infectious complications following HCT. Using a unique cohort of 5000 donor and recipients we will perform genome-wide association studies. We will define and validate invasive aspergillosis (IA) phenotypes based on fungal antigenemia and clinical outcomes, and then define genetic variants that increase risk for IA acquisition. Using the same cohort, we will define genetic variants that increase the risk of important viral infections. Specific Aim 3. To determine how the use of antibiotics and dietary fiber intake affect gut microbiota and subsequent infections after HCT. In a prospective cohort study (N=500) we will determine the effect of antibiotic regimens and dietary fiber intake on the gut microbiota and bacterial complications, and determine if changes in gut the microbiota modulate susceptibility to viral infection and affect adaptive immunity. Specific aim 4. To conduct studies to characterize HHV-6 as a pulmonary pathogen in HCT recipients. In a cohort of patients evaluated for pneumonia by bronchoalveolar lavage (N=725), we will examine HHV-6 viral load, viral integration and cytokine expression profiles of HHV-6 LRD and characterize factors associated with overall mortality and death due to respiratory failure. These aims support an innovative approach toward POR in the field of transplant infectious diseases and the proposed studies have a high potential of advancing our knowledge of the spectrum of infectious complications, the genetic basis of diseases, and the role of microbiome."
"9378730","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Severe delayed post-polypectomy induced ulcer (PPIU) bleeding is a common problem with increased numbers of colonoscopies being performed and with more patients taking anti-coagulants or anti-platelet drugs. Current medical guidelines are not effective for prevention of delayed bleeding nor is empiric closure of PPIU's with clips because the underlying artery is still  patent in the ulcer base as shown by our recent Doppler endoscopic probe (DEP) studies. Specific Aims: The primary aim is to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare rates of delayed hemorrhage after DEP detection of arterial blood flow and focal treatment in PPIU's (treatment arm) with standard treatment using medical guidelines alone (controls) for prevention of delayed bleeding in high risk patients after snare resection of benign colon polyps. Secondary specific aims are quantitate hospitalization rates and hospital days for delayed PPIU bleeding and study the natural history and risk factors. Methods: This is a RCT performed by the CURE Hemostasis Research Group for high risk patients - those with PPIU's 15 mm in size with or without drugs associated with bleeding; or patients who require anti-coagulants or anti-platelet drugs and have PPIU's 10 mm or larger. Outpatients, scheduled for screening or surveillance colonoscopies, who give written informed consent and meet entry criteria will be randomized to control/no DEP (medical treatment without PPIU closure) or DEP (as a guide to arterial blood flow detection and focal obliteration of it with hemoclips and/or low power MPEC probe). Patients will be prospectively followed at 7, 14, and 30 days for bleeding, hospitalization complications, or unscheduled visits for healthcare after polypectomies. Data will be prospectively collected, checked for completeness, de-identified, entered onto data files, and managed with SAS. Univariable and multivariable analyses will be performed to evaluate the clinical, endoscopic, and blood flow risk factors for delayed PPIU hemorrhage. Based upon recent results, our sample size estimate is for 330 patients, 165 in each treatment group. With the numbers of colonoscopies done here for screening surveillance, abdominal pain, or change in bowel habits in high risk patients and the referral of large polyps for removal, we anticipate completion of enrollment and follow-up in 4 1/2 years and the RCT in 5 years. To increase the generalizability of results to the US population and the scientific scope, we plan to enroll patients at both WLA VA medical center (primary center) and additional Veterans and many more females in a secondary center - UCLA which is a closely affiliated, university medical center where the investigators also attend."
"9396556","Teledermatology has emerged as an effective option to enhance the access of patients to high quality skin care in VA. VA's Office of Connected Care has developed two innovative mobile apps for VA teledermatology. One app, VA Telederm, streamlines the current workstation-based consultative process between primary care providers, teledermatology imagers and dermatologists, and is intended to lower the threshold for utilizing teledermatology in VA primary care clinics. The other app, My Telederm, will allow established dermatology patients to follow-up with VA dermatologists remotely rather than using in-person, clinic-based appointments. The app is intended to reduce the distances that appropriate established patients must travel to dermatology clinics and to improve the reliability of follow-up. It is also anticipated to free up appointment slots for new and established patients who actually must be seen in-person. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that successful implementation of each app will facilitate access of Veterans to dermatologic care. Each mobile app and its associated technical and clinical support resources will be rolled out in a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design involving sites that are most likely to benefit from their use. The proposed research will compare outcomes for sites that have received the app to those that have not yet received it. Aim 1 will explicitly test the hypothesis by examining the following primary outcomes for both apps: 1) Measures of temporal access will be assessed by comparing intervention and control groups with respect to all dermatology consult and appointment completion times; 2) Measures of geographic access will include travel distance and rurality; 3) Measures of total access will be reflected in the total instances of care as reflected by the total numbers of dermatology/teledermatology encounters. In addition, outcome measures for the My Telederm app will also include timeliness of follow-up with respect to the target date, and the no-show rate, and the proportion of new patients in conventional dermatology clinics. Results will also be stratified by rurality. Aim 2 will examine the factors that affect successful implementation and impact of each app. Guided by the Replicating Effective Programs framework and Weiner's Organizational Theory of Implementation Effectiveness, we will conduct in-depth formative evaluations at 3 early adopter sites for each app to determine organizational, leadership, and end-user characteristics that correlate with implementation of the apps. In addition, using nationally and remotely available enterprise-wide data, we will measure implementation and adoption of apps at all participating sites. At the end of the study period, the proposed research will result in a novel documentation of mobile teledermatology's effectiveness in enhancing Veterans' access to dermatology services, as well as produce a comprehensive understanding of the factors leading to successful mobile telehealth implementation. The results will be of significance to VA as it develops and implements other mobile telehealth programs, and more generally to other healthcare organizations planning for large-scale telehealth interventions."
"9397649","By 2023, it is expected that the number of VHA enrollees aged 65 and over will increase from 4.1 million to 4.7 million. To meet the growing demand for long-term care services, VA expanded its home and community- based services (HCBS) through the Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act. These expansion efforts were based on the premise that HCBS provide care in Veterans' setting of choice for a lower cost than in institutional settings and with comparable outcomes. However, there is sparse evidence about the ability of HCBS to reduce long-term care costs in VA or in other settings. Further, previous VA evidence on HCBS expansion has been unable to: 1) look at a time horizon over which cost savings are likely to be realized, 2) identify a well-matched control group; or 3) employ robust methods that enable causal assessments of the impact of HCBS on subsequent outcomes. Strengthening this evidence base will help VA understand Veteran and system-level effects of HCBS expansion and achieve an appropriate level of HCBS investment. In this pilot study, we will conduct a longitudinal cohort analysis using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to evaluate the effect of VA HCBS expansion on Veterans' quality of life, the probability of nursing home entry, and the use of formal and informal home care services. Recent linkages between the HRS and VA and Medicare administrative data present a unique opportunity to test the appropriateness of using non-Veteran Medicare users, who were not exposed to HCBS expansion efforts, as an innovative control group. With HRS data, we will use previously unavailable information on functional status and formal and informal home care use to address differences between Veterans who are VHA users and non-Veteran Medicare users. We will also assess outcomes over a much longer time horizon than previous studies to overcome the abovementioned limitations of existing literature. Specifically, in this pilot we will 1) compare the functional status and other characteristics of VHA users and non-Veteran Medicare groups; 2) identify the best methods to match the two groups on observable characteristics; 3) describe trends in quality of life, nursing home use, and formal and informal home care service use for these groups pre- and post- HCBS expansion; and 4) identify the most appropriate methods to determine the causal effects of HCBS expansion on each outcome. These analyses will inform a future IIR that will use the linked HRS-VA and Medicare administrative data to determine the effect of HCBS expansion on Veteran and caregiver outcomes and VA system-level costs. This will allow us to assess whether HCBS expansion has been cost-effective from a VA perspective. The results of this pilot project will be relevant to Veterans, their caregivers, and VA policy makers involved in allocating long-term care funding and will be an innovative contribution to the broader literature on the value of HCBS expansion."
"9402059","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent form of adult leukemia and is currently incurable. Two thirds of patients diagnosed with CLL are age 65 or older, and while fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy is standard initial therapy for younger patients, the optimal therapy for older patients is less clear. Both a randomized phase III study and a retrospective analysis of Cancer and Leukemia Group B trials showed no benefit to fludarabine over chlorambucil in the elderly population, while rituximab offers benefit irrespective of age. While recent data suggest that administration of the alkylator agent chloramubucil or benadmustine together with rituximab is feasible in this population, outcome is still suboptimal for what represents the largest population of CLL patients. Additionally, the relevance and impact of new biologic markers and minimal residual disease status predictive of response duration and survival in younger patients has not explored in the elderly. New therapies and validation of biomarkers identified in younger patients is therefore a high priority for research in this population. Ibrutinib is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of Bruon's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), a critical kinase involved in B cell development and signaling through the B cell receptor (BCR). In a Phase Ib/II trial co-led by our group, the clinical activity associated with this agent has been extraordinary, with a 26 month PFS of 76% for patients with relapsed and refractory CLL, and 96% for elderly patients with previously untreated disease. This agent has been well tolerated as well with extended continuous dosing. Building upon our previous work, in this application we propose a Phase III clinical trial investigating ibrutinib alne or ibrutinib plus rituximab compared with standard therapy of bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) in older patients with previously untreated CLL. Correlative analyses of established and novel prognostic markers are proposed in an attempt to identify biomarkers associated with response and outcomes. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1: To perform a phase III clinical trial comparing a) ibrutinib, b) ibrutinib plus rituximab and c) BR in symptomatic CLL patients ? 65 years to determine the therapy with highest response, PFS and OS. 2: To perform pharmacodynamic (PD) studies in this phase III study to determine whether traditional genomic features, select baseline BCR activation markers, and changes in miR marker expression over 1 month are predictive for best response, time to clinical response, PFS, and OS. 3: To evaluate longitudinal samples after ibrutinib therapy to evaluate the characteristics of persistent lymphocytes and determine whether changes in coding or non-coding RNAs, acquisition of mutations in BTK or PLC?2, or presence of minimal residual disease at 9 or 24 months will be predictive of late relapse and PFS after ibrutinib-based therapies. It is anticipated that the clinical and laboratory findings derived from this trial will be transformative in how elderly CLL are treated and contribute significantly to the design of future clinical trials for these patients"
"9428950","Abstract  In the general U.S. population, it is estimated that 25.3 million adults experienced chronic pain in the past year. Depression is highly co-morbid with pain, increases the severity and chronicity of pain, and is predictive of nonadherence to medical recommendations. Positive affect is uniquely related to a host of beneficial outcomes including less pain, higher functional status, and better adherence to medical recommendations, independent of the effects of depression and other negative affects. There is a need for effective, easily disseminated interventions to help people cope with chronic pain, decrease depression and distress that pose barriers to optimal adherence and potentially boost the efficacy of integrative as well as conventional pain treatments. Our goal for this proposed R34 is to develop LARKSPUR (Lessons in Affect Regulation to Keep Stress and Pain UndeR control), an online-delivered positive affect skills intervention tailored for people living with chronic musculoskeletal pain to optimize effects on depression, adherence, and pain in conjunction with integrative or conventional treatments. LARKSPUR will be based on our previously developed online positive affect intervention for people coping with a variety of health-related stress. In order to tailor the existing intervention, we will conduct focus groups and user tests with people living with chronic pain and consult with integrative health providers who commonly treat chronic pain. We will then conduct a randomized pilot trial of the tailored intervention in people seeking integrative treatment for chronic musculoskeletal pain. In the final phase, in collaboration with BraveNet, a practice based research network, we will determine optimal sites for a future randomized trial based on patient base, integrative treatments offered, partner primary care sites, electronic health records, and outcomes of feasibility assessments at potential sites. The proposed study will lay the foundation for future implementation of LARKSPUR in integrative medicine and primary care clinics by selecting sites for a future high-quality, adequately powered trial of LARKSPUR as an adjuvant to integrative or conventional treatments for chronic pain."
"9405832","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In both humans and mice, Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are required to suppress self-reactive T cells and prevent autoimmunity. In addition to this suppressor function, Treg cells are also present in non-lymphoid tissues, where they may utilize distinct transcriptional programs to perform tissue-specific functions. However, a molecular understanding of tissue Treg development and function remains elusive. To address the properties and functions of Treg cells in non-lymphoid tissues, I have examined the transcriptome of hepatic Treg cells by RNA sequencing. By comparing highly expressed genes in hepatic Treg cells to previously generated gene expression data of Treg cells from adipose tissue and colon, I have identified the nuclear receptor ROR? as being enriched in Treg cells from these three peripheral tissues. Subsequently, I will define the role of ROR? in Treg cells by extensively characterizing conditional knockout mice in which Treg cells lack ROR?. I will use genetic tools and a candidate approach to identify the molecular signals that regulate ROR? expression, and RNA sequencing to identify the genes regulated by ROR? in Treg cells. Using the liver as a model organ for its unique capacity for regeneration, I will examine the role of Tre cells in the setting of necro-inflammatory liver damage versus compensatory hyperplasia. I will use conditional knockout mice in which Treg cells lack ROR? or other tissue-Treg-specific molecules, or Foxp3DTR mice in which Treg cells can be depleted, to determine the functional significance of Treg cells in tissue repair. Tissue Treg cells are an attractive candidate for immunomodulation in the therapy of many autoimmune, infectious, metabolic, and neoplastic diseases. By advancing basic knowledge of the mechanisms governing tissue Treg function, the proposed research may reveal novel strategies for immunotherapy."
"9403257","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The goal of the Rat Genome Database (RGD) is to provide a research platform encompassing comprehensive genetic, genomic, physiological, and phenotype datasets, and innovative software tools for data mining, presentation and analysis. RGD's user community includes those using rat to investigate genomic elements involved in biological and disease processes, clinical researchers using rat models to understand the impact of genetic and environmental variations on disease and those using informatics and computational approaches to analyze data.

"9475102","This multi-center VA study of visual function and structure in veterans after mild Traumatic Brain Injury (Palo Alto, Minneapolis and Iowa City VA Medical Centers), will address two main topic areas identified as priorities for the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC): 1) Studies which focus on understanding neurosensory deficits associated with chronic mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and 2) Studies which assess diagnostics and prognostic measures for neural degeneration. The main aims of the grant are to prospectively study visual structural and functional consequences of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in the eye and their connections in the brain to determine if progressive worsening occurs and to compare ocular and brain biomarkers of structure and function for diagnosis and prognosis. With this proposal, a more complete picture of the spectrum of visual sensory disturbances after mTBI will be obtained by utilizing more detailed tests of visual function and ocular motility, as well as newer structural analyses of OCT combined with functional MRI imaging of visual pathways in the brain (fMRI) and volume analysis of corresponding grey and white matter locations. We hypothesize that after mild TBI, structural and functional biomarkers of damage are more prevalent than previously appreciated in the eye and corresponding visual centers of the brain, providing the first evidence linking TBI-induced neural degeneration to eye and brain locations. Our second main hypothesis is that mild TBI and repeated episodes can cause a chronic progressive decline in eye and CNS biomarkers of vision in a subset of susceptible veterans. This is based on strong preliminary data from our own studies and that of our collaborators in humans and in established animal models of mild TBI, which show that acute injury initiates visual pathway damage, leading to a chronic, progressive process of neural degeneration. This proposal will have two Specific Aims - 1: Determine whether ocular functional and structural biomarkers after mild TBI significantly correlate with corresponding visual pathway biomarkers in the brain. 2: Determine whether ocular and corresponding location CNS biomarkers progress over time after mild TBI. Currently, it is not known if neuronal loss in the retina and brain after mTBI continues to progress over time. Closing this knowledge gap will be important for understanding and treating TBI-related visual symptoms and for establishing whether ocular biomarkers can be used to predict risk of CNS dysfunction and its progression over time."
"9507035","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with high heritability. Years of research show that SCZ is not a monogenic disease but a network disease with multiple risk genes and environmental factors of small effects interacting with each other to produce the clinical phenotype. The same risk factors can be implicated in multiple diseases, stressing the importance of studying SCZ in a network context. Our central hypothesis is that there are shared pathogenetic gene networks that underlie the complex and heterogeneous interactions of risk factors. Identification of such shared SCZ gene networks will be essential for identifying shared therapeutic targets. Remarkable advances have been made in recent genetic studies with an increasing number of risk gene loci reaching genome-wide significance. However, functional effects of many of these loci have not been elucidated due to their presence outside of the coding regions. Thus, developmental brain tissues from control and SCZ patients will be instrumental in clarifying their effects on gene expression during SCZ pathogenesis, leading to mechanistic insights into SCZ gene network and etiology. To this end, we have successfully optimized the differentiation of iPSCs into Medial Ganglionic Eminence (MGE)-type interneurons, which are one of the most consistently affected neural types in SCZ. Interestingly, our preliminary transcriptome analysis has shown that a significantly affected gene ontology term in developing SCZ MGE-type interneurons was the immune response, suggesting interactions between SCZ genomic burden and immune activation. In accordance with these findings, there were enriched SCZ associations among immune genes in a recent large-scale GWAS. Furthermore, maternal infection during pregnancy has been associated with SCZ and maternal immune activation models exhibit SCZ-like postnatal behavioral and histopathological abnormalities, including those in interneurons. Thus, employing highly homogeneous and well-characterized Sox6+GABA+ MGE-type interneurons from controls and SCZ iPSCs, we will test our hypothesis of shared SCZ gene networks during pathogenesis by analyzing common disturbances in SCZ transcriptome during neurodevelopment and their interactions with immune activation. To minimize controllable sources of variability, we will limit our subjects to non-Hispanic Caucasian males with severe disease phenotypes (treatment-resistant SCZ that required Clozapine treatment). Uncovering shared gene networks by various SCZ risk factors during development will provide novel and systemic insights into SCZ pathogenesis, complementing SCZ genetic studies by allowing analysis of tissue-specific modes of gene mis-expression. This will also lead to novel therapeutic targets for preventive treatments, which will address the primary pathologic processes rather than merely control symptoms."
"9393334","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cardiac response to chronic stress involves the activation of a signal transduction network that induces myocyte hypertrophy and that in disease promotes myocardial apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis contributing to the development of heart failure. The phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) plays a central role in these processes. In cardiac myocytes there are two different isoforms of the CaN catalytic subunit, A? and A?, and yet only A? is required for myocyte hypertrophy. Because CaN isoforms have similar substrate specificity and share common binding partners, it is unclear why there would be functional differences between the isoenzymes. We recently performed a screen for CaNA?-specific binding partners. One protein that bound CaNA specifically is CIP4, a member of the F-BAR family of membrane-associated proteins. With the exception of our recent publication showing that CIP4 is required for the hypertrophy of cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes, F-BAR proteins have not been studied in the heart. In this application, we test the hypothesis that by serving as a CaNA? scaffold, CIP4 contributes to the regulation of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. We propose that CIP4 binding co-localizes CaNA? with upstream receptors, ion channels and/or other signaling molecules that specifically confer CaNA? function in pathologic cardiac remodeling. Specific Aim 1: The Requirement for CIP4 in Cardiac Remodeling In Vivo. In light of our in vitro findings, we propose to characterize the cardiac phenotype of a new conditional, cardiac-specific CIP4 knock-out mouse. The mice will be studied both when unstressed and when subject to chronic transverse aortic constriction, ?-adrenergic, and angiotensin II receptor stimulation. We anticipate that the CIP4 knock-out mouse will have relatively normal cardiac function when unstressed and will be protected from the cardiac remodeling induced by pressure overload and neuroendocrine stimulation. Specific Aim 2: Mechanisms underlying CIP4-CaNA signaling in myocytes. Using novel FRET biosensors that will detect Ca2+ and CaN activity at CIP4 complexes, we propose to study the regulation of CIP4-bound CaNA? in cultured adult and neonatal myocytes. We will study the co-localization of CIP4 and CaNA? in the myocyte and test whether, as in other cell types, CIP4 localization may be regulated by growth factor and G-protein coupled receptor stimulation and by Rho family GTPases. In addition, we will determine whether gene expression regulated by the CaN effectors NFATc and MEF2 requires CIP4 expression in vivo. Specific Aim 3: Therapeutic Disruption of CaNA? Anchoring In Vivo. The central hypothesis of this application is that the unique role of CaNA? in pathological myocyte hypertrophy is due to CaNA? anchoring by specific scaffolds. We propose to express selectively in the cardiac myocyte anchoring disrupter peptides for CaNA? in order to test whether disruption of CaNA? anchoring can prevent pathological remodeling in response to long-term pressure overload and catecholamine infusion."
"9347404","An Influenza pandemic remains an acute threat to world health; and stockpiling a universally protective Influenza vaccine provides a strong defense against this potential catastrophe. The hemagglutinin (HA) protein is the primary target of humoral Ab responses to Influenza; the majority of broadly protective mAbs (bnAbs) against influenza isolated from humans recognize conserved and conformation-specific epitopes in the HA Stalk. But, strain-specific, immunodominant epitopes in the Head of HA overwhelm immune responses to the Stalk. An HA immunogen from which the Head domain has been removed will elicit anti-Stalk antibodies that protect broadly against seasonal, as well as pandemic, Influenza. Despite significant progress, it has so far not proved possible to design a stable Headless HA that assumes its fully native conformation and thereby elicits universally protective Ab responses. None of the most promising, recent designs have progressed to clinical development. Avatar has developed a strategy to produce a conformationally intact Headless HA that overcomes these limitations. This strategy involves first locking the structure of the conserved Stalk with target dityrosine (DT) crosslinks, so that it can no longer lose its native conformation. Then we remove the variable and immunodominant Head domain with a site-specific protease, using engineered recognition sites. This DT- Headless HA immunogen is in its fully native conformation, and responses to this more perfect immunogen will improve Ab titers and affinities to conserved epitopes, and thus protect broadly against all strains of Influenza. In Phase I, we successfully designed and characterized our DT-Headless HA (AI118087). In Phase II we will demonstrate heterologous protection in Balb/c mouse challenge studies, and confirm efficacy of this product in ferret challenge studies (Aims 1 & 2). We will also transfer our design into a Group II HA and test its heterologous protection in mouse and ferret lethal challenge studies (Aim 3 & 4). By inducing higher avidity, higher titer Ab responses to the conserved Stalk, Avatar's Headless HA immunogen will give rise to broad protection against homologous and drift variants, as well as Group 1 & 2 heterologous challenge. We will compare the results obtained with our Group I and II Headless HA immunogens and select a product candidate for preclinical and clinical development."
"9387422","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Combined impairments in hearing, vision, olfaction, and pain perception are a major contributor to neurocognitive disabilities and adaptive functioning worldwide. Nearly one-third of the population suffers from sensory disorders involving taste, smell, hearing, or balance in their lifetime. Current treatments for congenital or acquired sensory impairments are strictly supportive, and there is a critical unmet need for the development of regenerative therapies. CHARGE Syndrome is a multiple sensory disorder second only to Usher Syndrome as a cause of deaf blindness. CHARGE is characterized by ocular coloboma, heart defects, atresia of the choanae, retardation of growth and development (including intellectual disability and autism), genital hypoplasia (including hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), and ear defects including deafness and inner ear dysplasia. CHARGE is caused by heterozygous mutations in the CHD7 gene encoding a DNA binding ATP- dependent chromatin remodeling protein. Study of CHD7 function is relevant for multiple sensory disorders, as it is highly expressed during development and in mature ear, eye, nasal, craniofacial, brain, and craniofacial tissues. CHD7 binds to methylated histones at enhancer sequences and transcription start sites throughout the genome, in a tissue and developmental stage-specific manner. Current challenges include identification of important target genes and signaling pathways that mediate the cellular effects of CHD7, and determination of whether mammalian CHD7 deficiency phenotypes can be prevented or reversed. Our laboratory has studied mouse models of CHARGE Syndrome and found that CHD7 is a major positive regulator of neural stem cell proliferation in the olfactory epithelium, inner ear, and forebrain subventricular zone. Interestingly, there is significant overlap in phenotypes between CHARGE Syndrome, retinoic acid embryopathy, and vitamin A deficiency in both humans and mice, raising the possibility that control of vitamin A levels may influence CHD7 effects. Preliminary data indicate that altered retinoic acid signaling partially rescues Chd7 heterozygous null phenotypes, suggesting CHD7 and retinoic acid function through common signaling pathways. We have developed the global hypothesis that CHD7 and retinoic acid signaling share common mechanisms or genetic targets that are necessary for proper development of craniofacial structures and neural stem cell proliferation. We propose four aims to test this hypothesis: (1) Determine whether up-regulation of retinoic acid signaling is an essential component of the phenotypes observed in Chd7 deficient mice, (2) Evaluate CHD7- dependence of retinoic acid signaling in proliferation of mouse neural progenitors, (3) Identify common retinoic acid signaling and CHD7 binding sites in neural stem cells, and (4) Test recently generated human induced pluripotent stem cells from CHD7-mutation positive CHARGE individuals for retinoic acid dependent proliferation and differentiation. Results will identify basic mechanisms of chromatin-mediated gene expression in mammalian cells and help establish a basis for the rationale design of pre-clinical trials."
"9509093","Project Summary/Abstract The prevalence of pulmonary infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is increasing worldwide, and among them, chronic pulmonary disease caused by Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) is the most difficult to manage. A common cause of opportunistic lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and other pre- existing lung diseases, MABC organisms are naturally resistant to almost all known antibiotics; there is no known curative treatment regimen for chronic MABC lung disease, and thus the prognosis is poor. The two major ob- stacles to improving treatment of MABC pulmonary disease are first the lack of research to discover new drugs effective against MABC, and second the lack of validated preclinical models of long-term chemotherapy that could support evaluation of potentially curative treatment regimens. The research described in this proposal contributes to addressing both of these fundamental issues. By accessing novel antimycobacterial compounds already in development for tuberculosis treatment (through partnership with the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development), the bactericidal activity of new combination drug regimens will be evaluated in a mouse model of acute MABC infection. Data obtained from this work has immediate translational potential and could rapidly provide new treatment options for patients with MABC pulmonary disease. However, as short-term treatment studies cannot accurately predict the long-term curative potential of a regimen, a series of novel infection strat- egies will be assessed for development of a mouse model of chronic MABC pulmonary disease. Development of a reproducible mouse model of chronic MABC lung disease will better preclinical-to-clinical translation of po- tentially curative treatment regimens. Overall, the work in this proposal is expected to produce new treatment regimens for patients with MABC pulmonary disease and new tools to facilitate their translation to the clinic."
"9407151","Project Summary/Abstract:  Survivors of Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) suffer from long-term morbidity in the form of functional disability, cognitive impairment, major or minor depression, and anxiety. These complications negatively impact the quality of life of these ARF survivors, interfere with their recovery, lead to long-term disability, and cost the health care system $3.5 million per ARF survivor. These sequelae and attendant morbidity have now been designated as the post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Although there are community resources and rehabilitation services, but due to a fragmented healthcare delivery process, a meaningful recovery is unattainable.  Indiana University Center for Aging Research (IUCAR) has over 20 years of experience to provide interdisciplinary, collaborative care utilizing care coordinators integrated with primary care and other specialties. These care models have improved care of elderly with chronic disease states such as dementia, depression, and functional impairment by overcoming fragmented care through care coordination. The current proposal termed the Mobile Critical Care Recovery Program (m-CCRP) for Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) Survivors builds from the IUCAR's experience of delivering collaborative care. The m-CCRP aims to improve the recovery of ARF survivors through a randomized controlled trial utilizing a mobile care coordinator. The trial has the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the efficacy of m-CCRP in improving the health related quality of life of ARF survivors. 2) Evaluate the efficacy of m-CCRP in improving the cognitive, physical, and psychological function of ARF survivors. 3) Evaluate the efficacy of m-CCRP in reducing the health-care utilization by ARF survivors.  This research is innovative as it promotes a novel interdisciplinary intervention among ARF survivors with continuous feedback and rapid adaptability. The outcomes of this trial will be significant and foundational for dissemination/ implementation of the program across the US health care system to achieve the aims of better health, better care, and reduced health care utilization as promoted by the Institute of Healthcare."
"9403261","Project Summary/Abstract Despite extensive knowledge of metabolic pathways, understanding the basic metabolic mechanisms of prominent diseases is limited by the ability to grasp the regulation of complex metabolic systems. Genetic gain/loss of function approaches have provided a wealth of information about how metabolism can be regulated, but have not been very successful at identifying the cause of complex disease. Ideally, top-down approaches would be used to examine the function of metabolism using quantitative approaches, then to guide gain/loss of function studies. The scientific community is moving quickly to stable isotopes because of high information yield, convenience, and the capacity to translate methods between human subjects, rodent models and cell preparations. To accomplish this goal, it is essential to extend earlier concepts using computational methods, and to integrate mass spectrometry (MS) with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). However, in order for the approaches to be embraced by the molecular physiologist/geneticist or clinical scientist interested in disease physiology, they must be flexible, reliable and easy-to-use methods relevant in a wide range of conditions. In this TR&D project we will perform cell, rodent and computational studies to develop translation methods to address these needs. First, we will integrate tracer flux approaches and metabolomics to identify target enzymes in the regulation of metabolism or its dysregulation during disease. Secondly, we will leverage the specificity of NMR isotopomer analysis and the sensitivity of mass isotopomer analysis to measure flux with high confidence on milligram scale samples. Finally, we will develop and distribute a free, open source software platform that simulates NMR and MS data based on flux/tracer input and calculates flux from experimental data in a single, easy to use graphical interface complete. Accomplishing these aims will provide the scientific community with new tools that will guide tactical studies in pharmacology, genetics and clinical science."
"9537021","Abstract Sexually transmitted infection by herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) is a major health problem. HSV-2 genital infections can also significantly enhance susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus. There is no vaccine or protective therapy available to control the transmission of the virus, which is on the rise. In lieu of an effective vaccine, we recently demonstrated the feasibility of a novel microbivac approach as an effective mucosal immunity boosting virucidal platform. Under this strategy, uniquely designed zinc oxide tetrapod nanoparticles (ZOTEN) provide instant microbicidal benefits to the vaginal surface via high-affinity trapping of invading HSV-2 virions. The trapping renders the virions unable to enter cells of the vaginal epithelium. As an additional advantage of this approach, innate and adaptive immune mechanisms are triggered when the virions captured on ZOTEN are presented to and processed by professional phagocytes including mucosal antigen presenting cells (APCs). We also demonstrated that ZOTEN provides adjuvant-like benefits that are very similar to those seen with alum. This proposal will test our hypothesis that inhibition of HSV-2 attachment receptor, heparan sulfate, from cells on the surface of the genital epithelium will enhance the microbivac efficacy of ZOTEN. We propose that inhibition of virus binding to cells will generate stronger infection blockade and a more robust adaptive immune response against the trapped virus. Our hypothesis is supported by brand new data that binding of anti-HSV peptide, G2, to heparan sulfate proteoglycans stops infection and in addition, triggers internalization of heparan sulfate from the surface of cells. Using a mouse model of female genital infection our central hypothesis will be tested by two specific Aims. Aim 1 will test the first part of our hypothesis that inhibition of heparan sulfate by G2 will protect the cells on the vaginal surface from the deleterious effects of HSV-2 while enhancing the virucidal benefits of ZOTEN. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that in the presence of G2, the ZOTEN/HSV-2 complexes drive stronger adaptive immune responses. We also propose that dual action by the microbivac will generate strong immunotherapeutic effects, which will be confirmed by a second round of HSV-2 infection. Analyses of key cytokines/chemokines will be made to determine the status of mucosal innate immunity under various treatment conditions. Overall, our exploratory and proof-of-concept studies will establish a role for heparan sulfate inhibition in generating higher microbivac efficacy, and guide future designs for more effective prevention of genital herpes transmission and associated disease manifestations."
"9412752","Proposal Summary (Abstract) Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells work well in treating patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but much less so in other more indolent B cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Improved CAR T cells are necessary to enhance antitumor efficacy in the treatment of these cancers. Our lab has recently demonstrated that constitutive expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD40 ligand (CD40L, CD154) improves cytotoxicity and antitumor efficacy of CAR T cells in vitro and in an immune- compromised xenograft mouse model. My hypotheses are that CD40L-modified CAR T cells promote an improved antitumor response through several mechanisms: (i) by enhancing the activation of CAR T cells resulting in improved cytotoxicity and functional CAR T cell persistence; (ii) by increasing the immunogenicity of tumor cells leading to their recognition by host immune effector cells; and/or (iii) via activation of host immune cells to mediate a sustained endogenous antitumor response. The long-term objectives of this proposed study aim to investigate the biology of CD40L-modified CAR T cells to provide mechanistic insights into how CD40L-modified CAR T cells achieve an enhanced antitumor efficacy when compared to T cells expressing the CAR alone. The first specific aim will be to transfer the CD40L-modified CAR T cell platform into a fully immune-competent syngeneic lymphoma mouse model and to determine its antitumor efficacy. Based on preliminary data, we anticipate that the results of these proposed experiments will validate the use of CD40L-modified CAR in this setting. The second specific aim will determine the effect CD40L-modified T cells have on the immunogenic phenotype of tumor cells and their clearance. The third specific aim will be to investigate the ability of CD40L-modified CAR T cells to change the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment and to induce an antitumor response by endogenous T cells. The implications of this work will extend beyond its application in indolent B cell malignancies, but also provide insight into how genetic engineering of T cells can alter the tumor microenvironment and provide a rationale for utilizing this CD40L- based CAR T cell approach in solid tumors."
"9431027","Project Summary/Abstract There is significant evidence that anesthetics which act at the GABAA receptor alter immune function and that multiple immune cell types express functional GABAA receptors. However, the mechanism of this immune modulation is unknown. In this proposal, we present exciting preliminary data demonstrating that mice lacking expression of the GABAA receptor ?4 subunit (gabra4), a subunit expressed in immune cells including CD4+ lymphocytes, have significantly greater lung inflammation after sensitization with house dust mite antigen, a common allergic asthma model. This heightened inflammation results in greater in vivo airway reactivity. We also demonstrate that gabra4 knockout CD4+ cells express increased inflammatory cytokines compared to wild type CD4+ cells when stimulated via the T cell receptor in vitro, suggesting the hyper-inflammatory phenotype of the gabra4 knockout mouse may be CD4+ cell-mediated. We hypothesize that GABAA receptor currents, which are depolarizing in CD4+ cells, alter calcium signaling processes key in lymphocyte activation and function, specifically calcium oscillations and store-operated calcium entry. We propose to demonstrate that ?4 subunit containing-GABAA receptors mediate currents in CD4+ cells which are augmented by GABAA receptor ligands, including XHE-III-74A, a novel ?4 subunit selective positive allosteric modulator developed by a collaborator. We will also determine if the CD4+ cell is key in producing the gabra4 KO mouse?s hyper-inflammatory phenotype by performing adoptive T cell transfer experiments. Furthermore, we propose to determine if altered GABAAR signaling affects CD4+ cell calcium dynamics (oscillations and store operated calcium entry) using a novel in situ calcium imaging technique that utilizes precision-cut lung slice technology. This offers the key advantage of maintaining the native environment of the inflamed lung. Finally, we will determine if XHE-III-74A, an ?4 subunit- selective GABAA receptor activator that does not cross the blood brain barrier, will limit house dust mite antigen induced lung inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness when administered chronically during the sensitization process. Although the studies proposed here focus on lung inflammation, the implications of this work may be relevant to inflammatory processes of many types. Given the widespread use of GABAergic medications, this research promises to be of high clinical significance. My department and Columbia University provide an ideal environment to complete these studies, as all necessary support is already in place. In addition, my proven mentoring committee provides a perfect blend of skills to help guide the science, including expertise in ion channel physiology, lung biology, immunology, and calcium signaling. A comprehensive career development plan has been established, including coursework and additional training. Taken as a whole, this K08 proposal outlines a robust pathway to scientific independence and the foundation of a successful and sustained career as a physician-scientist."
"9398089","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug Resistance in HCV NS3/4A and Beyond - Inhibitor Binding versus Substrate Recognition In the last 3-5 years the treatment of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) has been revolutionize by direct- acting antivirals (DAAs). NS3/4A protease was the first target for HCV where DAAs were developed. NS3/4A protease inhibitors (PIs) continue to be key components in the development of therapeutic options including combination therapies currently in phase 3 clinical trials. While the current PIs are highly potent against wil-type genotype 1 HCV, the rapid evolution of HCV and genotypic differences around the world allow viable variants with often multiple mutations that are resistant against these PIs, and decrease their effectiveness. Drug resistance is caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but nt sufficient for avoiding resistance. We hypothesize that the impact of multiple mutations selected under the pressure of PI therapy or in different genotypes is not simply additive, but these mutations have interdependent effects causing structural and dynamic changes to confer resistance. We will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which resistance occurs in HCV NS3/4A, and develop and implement strategies to design new inhibitors less susceptible to resistance. One key strategy is to compare inhibitor binding to substrate recognition and avoid functionally unessential contacts that are vulnerable to resistance mutations. The strategies we develop to design potent inhibitors less susceptible to resistance will also be translated to flaviviral proteases such as dengue, where no current DAA or vaccine exists."
"9624886","Project Summary/Abstract Bacterial keratitis (BK) is an infection of the cornea that, if left untreated, can cause blindness. Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) are three major causes of BK in North America. Symptoms of BK include pain, redness, inflammation, and opacity of the affected cornea and loss of visual acuity (1). AmebaGone Inc., (AG) partnered with UW-Madison Department of Ophthalmology to develop a novel biocontrol method to treat BK. AG holds issued patents and has expert knowledge related to use of Dictyostelid cells (DC), a benign, soil- dwelling organism known to destroy pathogenic bacteria through the phagocytosis. Issued patents broadly cover the use of DC to eat biofilm-enmeshed and free-living (planktonic) bacteria (?Therapeutic Ameba and Uses Thereof?; USPTO granted patent 8,551,471 and follow up patent US 8,551,671). A patent covering countries of the European Union has been filed and the firm has licensed rights to more than 3,000 DC strains from 3 worldwide collections occupying diverse natural habitats. Benign DC diverged from aquatic amoeba, some of which are pathogenic, over 1 billion years ago. In Phase I work, AG identified 36 Dicty strains capable of efficiently killing (> 4 log10 reduction in bacterial titers) Sa at eye temperature. Of these strains, AG identified 4 DC strains that reproducibly germinated to high levels and developed a gel formulation that increased the maximum recovery time from 1 to 16 hours. Additionally, AG tested safety of these DC strains and found no increase in corneal pathology or discomfort compared to the vehicle control. In the Phase II project AG proposes to: 1) Expand the target of DC from singular action against Sa to additional causative agents of BK- Pa and Sp, 2). Develop effective formulation and assess DC stability therein. 3) Conduct in vivo safety and basic biology testing of DC treatment in the eye, and 4). Quantify efficacy of DC cocktails in treating murine cornea infected with Sa, Pa, or Sp in vivo. The data generated in these studies will position us to prepare an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
"9355893","In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently."
"9432553","PROJECT SUMMARY The cerebellum plays a key role in motor control, particularly in motor learning. More recently, the cerebellum has also been implicated in cognitive processing. Indeed, cerebellar damage is associated with a wide range of neurological and neuropsychatric disorders, including ataxia, dystonia, schizophrenia and autism. Despite this apparent functional heterogeneity, the cerebellar microcircuit is remarkably homogeneous, both across its different regions and across different animal species. Thus, it has been suggested that the cerebellum may accomplish its job by performing one universal computation, and then sending out the results of the computation to other brain areas, both motor and non-motor. Previous work indicates that the universal computation performed by the cerebellum involves using past experience to predict future events, including those that are caused by our own movements. The long-term objective of this project is to achieve a full mechanistic understanding of how the cerebellum learns to make these predictions. The focus will be on the error signals that are critical for alerting the cerebellum that a prediction was wrong and needs to be updated. In the three aims of this proposal, we examine: 1) positive prediction errors (when something unexpected happens), 2) negative prediction errors (when something expected doesn't happen), and 3) temporal- difference prediction errors (when a stimulus predicts that something is about to happen). All experiments are done on a newly developed treadmill apparatus for eyeblink conditioning in head-fixed mice. Eyeblink conditioning was chosen as the model system because it offers a number of advantages for the project: 1) The behaviorally-relevant error signals are under experimental control and can be easily manipulated, 2) The basic conditioning task can be modified to ask questions about the role of error signals in driving both motor learning and higher-order associations, and 3) The olivo-cerebellar regions that are critical for processing error signals have been identified. By combining the elegant simplicity of eyeblink conditioning with new technologies for optogenetics, electrophysiology, and two-photon calcium imaging, the proposed experiments will record and manipulate the error-related neural signals present during the learning process with an unprecedented level of temporal and cellular specificity. This research could help develop new therapeutic approaches to treat motor and cognitive disorders associated with cerebellar dysfunction, not by targeting molecular mechanisms of neural plasticity, but the instructive error-related signals that drive them. In this regard, the specific aims of the application are designed to ask not only ?what is the neural code for error signals in the cerebellum?, but also ?how can we manipulate the code to enhance learning??."
"9601602","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Survival outcomes, such as overall survival and progression-free survival in cancer patients, and recurrent event endpoints, such as repeated opportunistic infections in cancer patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and repeated cardiovascular events in survivors of myocardial infarction, arise naturally in clinical and biomedical studies. It is important to identify individuals who are at a high risk of experiencing failure events so that these individuals can be targeted for more intensive monitoring and treatment. The objective of this project is to develop efficient and statistically proper methods to better model, estimate, and predict the risk of survival and recurrent event outcomes. The proposed statistical methods either provide new frameworks, offer solutions to problems where existing methods are either not available or are known to be inappropriate, or improve over existing methods. Under Aim 1, we develop new approaches for combining information from the individual- level data and aggregated survival information from external sources so that efficient estimation of the effects of interest and more accurate risk prediction fr the failure event can be achieved. The proposed approaches are very flexible in the sense that they can automatically combine survival information for different subgroups and the information may be derived from different studies. Under Aim 2, we propose non-restrictive semi parametric models and develop new approaches to deal with important analytical issues arising in the analysis of univariate and bivariate recurrent event data. The proposed approach can better characterize the effects of a treatment or risk factors and properly evaluate patients' quality of life beyond the first clinical event. Moreover, monitoring strategies and prophylaxis regimens can be tailored according to patients' risk problem based on the recurrent event models. Under Aim 3, we develop a novel binomial likelihood inference procedure for the additive hazards model which focuses on modeling the difference in the risk of failure events. The proposed methods are expected to be efficient and produce proper probability estimates even when sample size is small. Hence they will be particularly useful for the purpose of risk prediction. Th R package developed under this aim will further promote the use of additive hazards model in survival analysis. Under Aim 4, we investigate the bias induced by the ad-hoc last-observation-carried-forward approaches in the recurrent event data analysis, and propose a simple semi parametric estimation procedure that properly handles the covariate information collected at regular visits and that collected at recurrent event times to obtain consistent estimation. The proposed research holds both methodological significance and scientific significance. First, the proposed methodology has broad applicability in clinical and biomedical studies where survival and recurrent event outcomes are common endpoints. Second, for each aim, user-friendly software will be made freely available for public use. Finally, the proposed research holds the potential to advance the understanding of disease progression and to gain new knowledge about the long-term effects of treatment and intervention strategies on recurrent adverse events and mortality."
"9383039","In general, speakers phonate in order to convey information (linguistic or paralinguistic; intentionally or unintentionally) to a listener. The stages of transmitting information in this way can be described by the well- known ?speech chain.? We presently know a good deal about the individual steps along the chain, including motor planning, laryngeal innervation, tissue properties, the biomechanics of laryngeal vibrations, aeroacoustics, acoustics and resonance, and voice perception. However, very few studies address the manner in which information is transmitted from one stage to the next, much less from one end of this chain to the other. As a result, two important questions about voice remain unanswered: 1) When voice quality changes in some way, what caused the change? and 2) If a change occurs in the voice production mechanism, what will be the resulting perceived change in quality? In our view, these two questions define the primary goals of the study of voice. By combining computational modeling of voice production and acoustic and perceptual analyses of voice quality, this proposal addresses these critical questions in a series of studies designed 1) to complete final development of a theoretically-motivated measurement protocol for voice quality that enables users to reliably and validly assess the overall, integral quality of a voice; and 2) to develop a causal model linking changes in voice acoustics and quality to underlying physiologic mechanisms. Finally, we will investigate how changes in psychoacoustic or physiologic parameters relate to the extent to which a voice deviates from normal, in a better-to-worse continuum. Such information would facilitate objective and meaningful comparisons across individual patients and clinicians in evaluation and documentation of treatment efficacy, and would begin to provide explanations for the physical origins of particular quality disorders."
"9565026","Project Summary About 15-20% of breast cancer patients fall under the basal-like category, which represent a diverse subtype that is characterized by tumors that are more aggressive conferring poor prognosis. Deaths from these carcinomas result from metastatic spread of the disease to distant sites and from therapeutic resistance, which results in the relapse of cancers into more aggressive forms that are difficult to contain. Both these properties are attributed to their cellular heterogeneity that arises through various mechanisms including clonal evolution and the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one program that we have shown to be responsible for the generation of cells that have CSC-like properties. Our current proposal aims to induce differentiation of these CSCs through the induction of a mesenchymal-to- epithelial transition (MET). To do this, we carried out a screen to identify compounds that are capable of inducing the transcription of E-cadherin, a hallmark of the epithelial/non-CSC state, in cells that are more mesenchymal/CSC-like. Through this screen we identified Forskolin, an activator of cAMP, to be able to induce E-cadherin transcription and a reversion of the mesenchymal/CSCs to a more benign epithelial state. Through this proposal we aim to uncover the mechanism by which cAMP-elevating agents are able to induce an MET by complete characterization of the essential downstream components of signalling, namely Protein Kinase A (PKA) and its downstream substrates. We also aim to understand the epigenetic reprogramming that occurs following activation of PKA through the functions of the histone-modifying enzyme PHF2. Both these components will address the mechanisms by which CSCs can be differentiated to a state that renders them highly sensitive to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin. Despite over two decades of research, our ability to specifically target CSCs is still lacking. Through the study of Phosphodiesterases and G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) that modulate cAMP levels, I aim to develop ways to specifically induce differentiation of CSCs that can be translated for therapeutic utility.  "
"9411761","Three highly related genes, Gata4, Gata5, and Gata6 (referred to here as Gata456) regulate essentially every aspect of cardiac biology, from generation of precardiac mesoderm, specification and differentiation of endocardial, epicardial, and myocardial progenitors, heart tube formation, growth and morphogenesis, septation and valve formation, cardioprotection and hypertrophy, and regeneration. How the three genes regulate the spatial, temporal, and tissue-specific genetic and epigenetic networks that underlie all of these disparate programs is poorly understood. Furthermore, mutations in each of the genes have individually been associated with human cardiomyopathies, including atrial and ventricular septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, bicuspid aortic valve syndrome, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy. Other transcription factor genes, and some terminal differentiation markers are known to be regulated by Gata456, but a major gap in understanding is the identify of the key target genes that control intermediary functions such as lineage specification, growth, morphogenesis, and cardio-protection. We propose a new program as a ?Pipeline of Discovery? to identify these downstream genes and probe their function in cardiogenesis and cardiac biology. The overall goal is to define the function of each Gata456 gene throughout development and adult life in various cardiac tissues including endocardium, myocardium, and epicardium. We seek to break the code for how the relative timing and location of expression for each gene impacts cell fate and survival, and organ morphogenesis and function. Complementary model systems exploit specific advantages and resolve species-specific distinctions: the zebrafish for understanding cardiogenesis including morphogenesis, and human pluripotent stem cells for understanding human cell identity and disease modeling. We have compiled a ?toolbox? of zebrafish and hESC lines and an expert team of investigators to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of gain-and loss-of-function phenotypes, with a strong track record for such analyses and discovery of novel downstream targets. A breakthrough is needed to understand how Gata456 controls all the various aspects of cardiogenesis. We are finally in a position to define this code, by a systematic manipulation of each factor in different developmental and tissue contexts, leading to discovery of specific key downstream target genes that carry out these diverse functions. This project will not directly develop therapeutics for cardiac disease, but it will likely enhance development of cellular therapies. Chiefly, it will break ground beyond current descriptions of regulatory networks in two areas: 1) Defining the impact for loss or gain of individual Gata456 alleles at specific developmental stages and in specific tissues to precisely define functions in developing animals (zebrafish) and human cells (derived from human pluripotent cells). 2) Identifying the key downstream Gata456 target genes that are responsible for stage and tissue-specific functions, recognizing these as ?lead hit? therapeutic targets for treating cardiac disease. !"
"9444827","PROJECT SUMMARY Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a devastating malignancy of muscle that is diagnosed in hundreds of children and adults annually in the USA. Survival rates are less than 30% in patients with unresectable, metastatic, or relapsed RMS, with continued tumor growth being maintained by a small number of self-renewing, tumor- propagating cells (TPCs). Yet, to date, targeted approaches to kill TPCs or to differentiate them into non- proliferative, differentiated RMS cell types have not been developed. The long-term goal of our work is to uncover therapeutically relevant pathways that drive RMS growth through their regulatory effects on TPCs. The overall objective of this application is to determine the extent to which non-canonical Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (Wnt/PCP) signaling regulates TPC self-renewal and can be targeted to inhibit RMS growth. Our central hypothesis is that Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), a core regulator of the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway, modulates self-renewal and growth of RMS TPCs. We also hypothesize that Vangl2 expression is confined to TPCs and can be used to isolate and characterize these cells. Our preliminary data indicate that Vangl2 and Wnt/PCP signaling regulate TPC self-renewal in both zebrafish and human RMS. VANGL2 inactivation leads to reduced TPC number, decreased tumor cell growth, and elevated differentiation in human RMS cells both in vitro and in vivo using mouse xenografts. Fluorescent transgenic zebrafish models of embryonal RMS also showed that Vangl2 expression enriches for self-renewing TPCs, providing novel approaches to dynamically visualize these cells in live animals and to quantify effects of altering Wnt/PCP signaling on self-renewal. The rationale for our work is that VANGL2 is active in a vast majority of human RMS and is required for continued tumor growth and self-renewal, suggesting that therapeutic strategies based on VANGL2 inhibition would benefit a large fraction of high-risk patients. Aim 1 will assess the role for Wnt/PCP signaling in RMS growth and self-renewal in a fluorescent-transgenic zebrafish model and patient-derived xenografts, testing our hypothesis that Vangl2 and the Wnt/PCP pathway regulate self-renewal and expansion of TPCs in RMS. Aim 2 will characterize Vangl2 as a marker of TPCs in both zebrafish and human RMS, providing unprecedented access to dynamically visualize roles for the Wnt/PCP pathway in regulating self-renewal and cell fate choices following cell division. Aim 3 will elucidate the effector pathways downstream of VANGL2 and Wnt/PCP signaling, testing our working hypothesis that VANGL2 drives self-renewal through the activation of RHOA small GTPase signaling. Our work will uncover the molecular pathways by which VANGL2 and the Wnt/PCP pathway drive human RMS growth and self-renewal. Such insights will provide new biomarkers for assessing drug effects on TPCs and will likely identify novel drug targets beyond VANGL2 for the treatment of RMS. Our work is predicted to have a large positive translational impact, advancing our understanding of processes that control self-renewal in cancer and providing pre-clinical efficacy of targeting VANGL2 to suppress growth of patient derived xenografts."
"9418032","An estimated 1.2 million parents of school age children will be newly diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. in 2016. Parental cancer causes substantial behavioral and emotional distress in both the diagnosed parent and child. An estimated 22-33% of the children exceed clinical cut off scores on standardized measures of distress or behavioral-emotional adjustment. Parents, regardless of education and socioeconomic level, are known to struggle with how and what to tell their child about their cancer or how to support the child during the many months of medical treatment. Treatment or disease-related symptoms and parental depressed mood negatively affect the child's physical and emotional access to the parent and the quality of parenting. Despite the magnitude of the problem and numbers affected, there is only 1 cancer parenting education program that has been tested for efficacy, the Enhancing Connections Program. In a 6-state randomized control trial, the program decreased parental depressed mood and anxiety, improved parenting quality, parenting skills and confidence, and enhanced the child's behavioral-emotional adjustment. Child outcomes were significant at 1- year follow up compared to controls. But that program, the Enhancing Connections Program (EC), was tested as an in-person delivered program, constraining its access and availability for parents for whom cost and time constraints or the burden of travel are prohibitive. In order to increase the potential sustainability of the EC Program, the program was formatted for group-delivery. The overall goal of the proposed study is to test the feasibility and short-term impact of the group-delivered EC Program within the largest provider of free group- delivered cancer support services in the United States, the Cancer Support Community, an organization that is a merger of the Wellness Community and Gilda's Club.  Phase I will involve training 6 Masters prepared social workers drawn from 3 Beta test sites of the Cancer Support Community in the United States. Phase II will involve implementing the program at these 3 Beta test sites and obtaining detailed data on the feasibility and short-term impact of the program on 33 program participants. A within group (pre-posttest) design will examine short term impact of the program. A total of 33 diagnosed parents with Stage 0-3 cancer will be enrolled, drawn from each Beta site's active recruitment channels. Eligible parents will have a child 5-17 years and read, write and speak English among their languages of choice. After consenting and obtaining baseline measures, study participants will receive 5 fully manualized group-delivered educational counseling sessions at 2- week intervals. Outcomes will be assessed at exit using the same standardized measures as those used to test efficacy of the EC. With a sample of 33 parents, effect sizes will range from medium to large: 0.51-1.16; p values will range from .008 to <.001. Longer term, results will be used to inform a larger implementation grant and clinical trial."
"9481485","SUMMARY Cryptosporidium is an AIDS-OI pathogen for which effective treatments are yet unavailable. It is also one of the top diarrheal-causing pathogens afflicting children in developing countries, causing significantly increased mortality and stunted growth. Humans acquire cryptosporidial infection by ingesting oocysts, from which sporozoites are released to infect gastrointestinal epithelial cells. The invasion of cryptosporidial sporozoites is a first step to initialize the infection, but the key molecules in host cells interacting with the parasite during the invasion remain unknown. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanism regulating the cryptosporidial invasion. Towards the goal, we initiated a UV irradiation-based host cell mutagenesis study, in which we produced 43 host cell mutants derived from the parent wild-type (WT) HCT-8 cells and identified one of the mutant (i.e., A05 mutant) was significantly defective in the parasite attachment and invasion. In comparison to WT cells, A05 cells are much less stretched out on the surface of culture plates, and cell-to-cell connections are generally loose, leaving apparent gaps between neighboring cells. Our central hypothesis is that a host cell membrane protein (or a protein complex) is required for the attachment and invasion by cryptosporidial sporozoites. The availability of A05 mutant makes it possible to identify mutated and/or significantly regulated genes that can be prioritized for individually validation of their role in the parasite attachment and invasion. This R21 proposal represents an early stage of forward genetic studies towards our long-term goal by achieving the following two specific aims. In aim 1, we will identify mutated and significantly regulated genes by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis will be utilized to identity protein-coding genes in the A05 mutant that are mutated and/or significantly regulated. Proteomic technology focus on identifying membrane proteins that are mutated and/or significantly regulated. Identified genes/proteins will be prioritized for functional validation. In aim 2, we will validation of the function of candidate genes in the parasite attachment and invasion. Based on the prioritized candidate genes in aim 1, their role in the attachment and invasion by sporozoites will be evaluated by antibody blocking assay, and by generating genetically modified cell lines from the WT HCT-8 cells for testing their susceptibility to the attachment and invasion. This proposal focuses on identifying gene mutations associated with the resistance to the attachment and invasion by Cryptosporidium sporozoites in A05 mutant for subsequent delineation of the molecular mechanism regulating the parasite attachment and invasion."
"9548330","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. With the majority of new HF diagnoses occurring in adults over age 75 years, HF is now recognized as a life course disease. It logically follows that a person's increasing risk for HF should manifest with progressive cardiac abnormalities that can be tracked over time, in relation to advancing age and cumulative risk exposures. However, conventional imaging methods have limited ability to discriminate between individuals more or less likely to develop clinical HF. We and others have shown that advanced ultrasonic measures of cardiac microstructure can reliably quantify tissue-level alterations in the cellular and extracellular composition of the myocardium, including fibrosis. Based on our prior work and preliminary data, we hypothesize that changes in cardiac microstructure over time are influenced by cumulative exposure to risk factors and that distinct patterns of change in cardiac microstructure can differentiate individuals at greater or lesser risk for HF. Therefore, we propose to use a novel ultrasonic method to study the changes in cardiac microstructure that occur over the life course and leading up to the development of HF and related adverse outcomes. Specifically, we will investigate: (1) the natural history and correlates of change in cardiac microstructure with aging, (2) the extent to which progressive alterations in cardiac microstructure predispose specifically to HF, and (3) the potential utility of cardiac microstructure to serve as a prognostic marker of risk for adverse outcomes across the spectrum of HF among persons living in the community. The overall contribution of the proposed research is expected to include: a comprehensive understanding of how cardiac microstructure is altered during the progression from risk factors to the onset of HF outcomes; and evaluation of a novel imaging-based measure of cardiac microstructure that could serve as a widely-accessible and cost-effective tool for predicting HF in individuals at risk. These contributions will be significant because they will lay groundwork for developing targeted interventions to reduce HF related morbidity and mortality in the population at large."

There is need to start training in Uganda in order to bridge the supply gap. Training within the region will reduce the cost of the program as a result of the increased numbers of individual trained and result in higher retention rates. The project is innovative and proposes a sustainable concurrent three level international ethics training program that includes certificate, diploma and master's degree awards that build a strong foundation for subsequent doctoral training (not part of this proposal) in about ten years' time. The overarching goal of this international research ethics program is to produce a sustainable supply of graduates who will show leadership and significantly contribute to improving standards and practice of research ethics to protect the safety and welfare of research participants in Uganda and the wider sub-Saharan Africa region. This will be done by developing: (1) Graduates capable of providing leadership in international research ethics and apply it effectively in teaching and mentoring individuals to participate in health research, manage research projects/ programs and also offer bioethics services consultations and policy advice. (2) Individuals who can undertake empirical and applied research on challenging ethical issues. And (3) Practitioners and researchers who can effectively provide consultation services and policy advise in international research ethics. This will be done using various ethics related courses whose delivery is guided by the use principles of adult learning and other features of the program aimed at ensuring the transfer of knowledge gained by the trainee to their home institutional environment. This is expected to contribute to strengthening improvements in research ethics capacity in Uganda and in the region to sustain high quality of international research ethics. Working with the relevant government departments like ministries of Public Service and of Health we will ensure that a career path for graduates of the program is well defined in Uganda and this may thus become a role model for other African countries. The 91 year old Makerere University with a student population of nearly 40,000 is by far the oldest and largest university in Uganda and is one of the most research intensive universities in Sub-Saharan Africa, ranked among the top 10 universities on the continent. The College of Health Sciences has four large schools of Medicine, Public Health, Biomedical Sciences and Health Sciences that include the Departments of Nursing, Pharmacy and Dentistry. The university has a large and rapidly expanding health research enterprise due to the many international research collaborations the college has. The East African regional block of countries (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi) have contributed to ground breaking research that has impacted policy and practice changes internationally particularly on communicable diseases including neglected tropical diseases, but also increasingly on non-communicable diseases, health systems and other health challenges. The Makerere University's vision is to become a research driven university and serve as a recognized regional and reference center of first choice for advice on ethical challenges, research on international ethics regarding priority challenges and for development of bioethics research capacity."

"9392564","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  People with spinal cord injury (SCI) experience uncontrolled involuntary muscle contractions (spasticity) that disrupt mobility, sleep, and comfort. Spasticity is typically treated pharmacologically, with myriad side effects. A more obvious consequence of SCI is impaired voluntary muscle control, of which limitations of walking function are one of the most devastating consequences. Numerous clinical trials have attempted to address these issues, however, to date no studies have undertaken a systematic approach that involves identify dose-response relationships, in the manner of pharmaceutical trials, prior to the intervention. Afferent input in the form of vibration has long been known to have a powerful effect on neural circuits; whole body vibration (WBV) represents an intense and generalized form of this afferent input. Preliminary studies from our lab suggest that afferent input in the form WBV may reduce spasticity improve walking and persons with SCI. Our findings related to the influence of WBV on spasticity are supported by a long history of studies showing that local vibration activates modulatory mechanisms. Recent studies from our lab have shown that local vibration elicits involuntary step-like behavior, even in persons with motor-complete SCI. Much of the prior work of our lab has centered on the use of afferent input, often combined with repetitive task practice, to promote neuroplasticity and improved motor function in persons with SCI. However, we have never been sure that the dose of afferent input (or the dose of practice) we used was optimal. This is a common problem that plagues rehabilitation research. Questions of dose are needed before progressing to larger trials. There is a clear need for rehabilitation research studies that are developed in progressive stages in the manner of pharmaceutical trials. Accordingly, the proposed study is a 2-Phase development-of-concept trial intended to evaluate dose-response effects, identify the most suitable outcome measures, and select optimal components of the intervention. This study will provide answers related to dose effects of WBV on spasticity, walking function, pain, and muscle strength by focusing on the following Aims: Specific Aim 1. (Phase 1; Years 1 - 2) Quantify early and late within-session effects on spasticity and walking function of 5 different WBV doses (4 doses, plus placebo) delivered 1 week apart. Specific Aim 2. Quantify the cumulative and persistent dosing effects on spasticity of once daily (1xWBV) versus twice daily (2xWBV) WBV at the dose most effective for reducing spasticity. Specific Aim 3 (Phase 2; Years 3 - 5). Quantify the cumulative and persistent dosing effects on walking function of 1xWBV versus 2xWBV at the most effective dose. Specific Aim 4 (Phase 2; Years 3 - 5). Characterize the cumulative and persistent dosing effects on pain and leg strength of 1xWBV versus 2xWBV at the most effective dose."
"9599624","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extremely effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV-1 persists in a small pool of latently infected, resting memory CD4+ T cells. Rapid viral rebound occurs after treatment interruptions. Therefore, life-long antiretroviral therapy is required, raising concerns about adverse effects over decades of therapy, the evolution of drug resistance, and the financial burden of chronic treatment. Current approaches to purging the latent reservoir involve pharmacologic reactivation of HIV-1 transcription by agents that reverse viral latency. The next step is to eliminate infected cells in which HIV-1 gene transcription has been induced by latency reversal agents (LRAs). To date, no broadly applicable strategy has been developed to effectively clear latent HIV-1 in vivo. Two major obstacles have prevented us from developing effective strategies to eliminate latent HIV-1 are: 1) the lack of understanding of cellular composition and anatomical location of the latent viral reservoirs in patients; and 2) the paucity of in vivo experimental systems with which to assess LRA efficacy and vaccination strategies to clear latent HIV-1. I studied HIV-1 infection in recently developed humanized mouse model named MISTRG, which supports co-development of human lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells. I have demonstrated that this novel mouse model could enable us to study HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells and multiple subsets of monocytes and macrophages. In the proposed work, I will utilize further improved MISTRG mouse models to systemically investigate HIV-1 latent infection in vivo and develop therapeutic strategies to purge latent viral reservoir. In K99 phase, I will first establish a humanized mouse model of HIV-1 latency under effective cART. With this animal model, I will investigate HIV-1 latent infection i macrophages as well as CD4+ T cells in secondary lymphoid organs and peripheral tissues including gut. Having developed MISTRG model for HIV-1 latent infection, I will study HIV-1 CTL escape variants in the latent reservoir, their response to LRA treatment, and design novel vaccination strategies to boost HIV-1-specific CTL responses at mucosal tissues for viral clearance (R00 phase). Overall, these studies will provide a scientific basis and preclinical evidence of a cure for HIV/AIDS."
"9605689","Contribution of LiaFSR to pathogenesis and carriage of group A Streptococcus PROJECT SUMMARY Asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens is a common but poorly understood phenomenon. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the cause of severe infections such as the ?flesh-eating? necrotizing fasciitis and more benign infections like pharyngitis. However, GAS is also carried in the throats of humans in the absence of symptoms (i.e. asymptomatic carriage). We understand little of the bacterial molecular genetic determinants contributing to GAS carriage. We hypothesize that mutations in GAS carrier strains contribute to a unique phenotype characterized by increased ability to adhere to mucosal surfaces and decreased ability to cause disease. We identified a mutation, unique to a GAS carrier strain, leading to a single amino acid change in a highly conserved sensor kinase, LiaS, of the poorly described GAS regulatory three component system (3CS) LiaFSR. We previously showed complete recapitulation of the carrier phenotype (increased adherence to mucosal surfaces and decreased virulence) when the carrier mutation in liaS was introduced into a serotype- matched disease-causing strain of GAS. We also discovered that the carrier mutation altered global gene regulation. The LiaFSR 3CS has been described in other bacteria but its contribution to virulence gene regulation in pathogenic bacteria is largely unknown. Further, the mechanism by which the carrier amino acid change in LiaS leads to gene dysregulation and the carrier phenotype is incomplete. We hypothesize that the carrier mutation alters function of the sensor kinase, LiaS, resulting in decreased activation of the target response regulator, LiaR, affecting gene regulation and leading to the carrier phenotype. By defining the mechanism by which the carrier mutation alters gene regulation and leads to a carrier phenotype, we may better understand the gene regulatory events associated with the transition from disease to carriage in GAS. We have proposed three aims to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will define in vitro and ex vivo-human conditions that activate the LiaFSR system. Aim 2 will determine global gene regulation by LiaFSR in GAS and define the genes affected by the carrier LiaS mutation. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the effect of the carrier mutation on the function of LiaS and subsequent response regulator activation. Upon completion of these aims, we will have defined the mechanism by which the carrier mutation leads to gene dysregulation and the carrier phenotype and simultaneously learned more about gene regulation in GAS pathogenesis. Ultimately, these studies will provide a foundation for future carriage research and potentially have implications in diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine development for GAS and other bacterial pathogens."
"9394795","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent obesity is a major public health issue for America: 34% of US adolescents ages 12-19 years are overweight or obese. The impacts of obesity on teenagers are found in many psychosocial and medical comorbidities; overweight and obese adolescents are also at high risk of becoming obese adults with lifelong associated risks. We propose a unique project to examine fundamental aspects of circadian and sleep biology, chemosensory perception, and psychophysiology that can influence food choices and food consumption and may differ between obese/overweight (OW) and normal weight (NW) adolescents. Healthy OW and NW boys and girls ages 12 to 15.9 years will live at home on a strict sleep/wake schedule for 2 weeks and then enter the lab for 11 consecutive days. Sleep/wake during the in-lab session are scheduled on a 28-h day, followed by a 32-h extended waking episode and a 4-h sleep. In-lab assessments include measures of sleep (polysomnography), chemosensitivity (taste and smell), arousal (multiple sleep latency test), circadian time (salivary melatonin), vigilance, impulse control, attentional bias, distraction, satiety, and hunger. Fasting levels of leptin, ghrelin, glucose, insulin, and cortisol will be measured at 6 circadian phases and compared across weight groups. Food choices and food consumption will be monitored throughout as the principal dependent variables. Specific hypotheses are: (1) OW will have later baseline circadian phase (dim light melatonin onset-DLMO) and longer intrinsic circadian period than NW; (2) OW will have reduced slow wave sleep at baseline and in response to extended wakefulness; (3) OW will select higher calorie food and consume more calories at later circadian phases than NW; (4) OW will select higher calorie food and consume more calories than NW later in the waking day. The influence of other measures (e.g., chemosensitivity, arousal, impulse control, etc.) in weight-group differences will be explored with latent growth modeling. Descriptive analyses and exploration of sex differences will also be performed. Findings from this study may bring to light specific eating-related risks factors for OW teens, may provide targets and strategies for countermeasures to prevent or ameliorate overweight and obesity in adolescents and the distress that ensues and may suggest ways to enhance weight loss interventions."
"9604635","Project Summary Saliva performs a number of extremely important biological functions that are instrumental in maintaining oral health. It has been estimated that more than 5 million people in the US suffers from salivary gland dysfunction (Sjogren's syndrome). Although no genes mutations have been identified that could explain the pathogenesis of Sjogren's syndrome (SS), recent evidence have suggested that T17-cell infiltration and induction of apoptosis in salivary gland acinar cells could be the two major events that could lead to salivary gland destruction. However, the molecular mechanism involved in the activation of T cells and apoptosis of salivary acinar cells is not known. Interestingly, similar to other autoimmune diseases, females have been shown to be affected with SS more than their male counterparts, with greater than 90% of SS cases being diagnosed in women. One hypothesis to explain this gender difference is that loss of random X-chromosome inactivation could be the cause of this disease (since many genes involved in immune function are expressed on the X- chromosome); however, the reason for the loss of X-chromosome inactivation is not known in any autoimmune disease, including SS. Results obtained from our ongoing studies indicate that a series of key epigenetic changes are observed in SS patients. As a result transcription of a set of genes that are essential for controlling proper immune response may be decreased. In addition, loss of expression of XIST1 (that is critical for random X-chromosome inactivation) may lead to the activation of certain genes on the X- chromosome that increases T cell activation, and initiates apoptosis. Furthermore, most of the loss of methylation on the X-chromosome was found in the CpG islands, which could lead to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting. To further understand the mechanism, we performed a global RNA seq analysis on control and SS samples and have identified that a master regulator gene ELF4 that is present on the X- chromosome was upregulated (due to loss of X-chromosome inactivation) and could assist in the pathology of SS. These results are novel, and suggest a strong epigenetic origin for SS, but they need to be further validated. Therefore, in this grant proposal we intend to thoroughly characterize the role of epigenetic changes in salivary gland destruction and to determine the relationship between abnormal methylation and X- chromosome inactivation. The hypothesis of this study is that epigenetic changes along with the loss of X- chromosome inactivation alters ELF4 that increases susceptibility to immune changes and promote apoptosis of acinar cells, thereby leading to salivary gland destruction. Thus, identification of the mechanism as well as the pathways that lead to salivary gland destruction could represent as drug targets in salivary gland dysfunction. We will coordinate our efforts in order to determine the functional significance of inhibiting epigenetic changes in order to protect against salivary gland destruction. The results of our studies are expected to provide new insights into the role of epigenetic changes and the molecular mechanism involved in salivary gland destruction. Greater understanding of these events will be important in elucidating new therapy for salivary gland dysfunctions and Sjögerns patients."
"9414975","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Aims and Rationale: The primary objective of this research is to produce an empirically validated treatment that increases smoking cessation in Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), one that can be easily integrated into smoking cessation clinics and/or mental health clinics within Veterans Administration (VA) facilities. PTSD is highly prevalent in the VA patient population and is associated with a rate of smoking (53% - 66%) that far exceeds that of VA enrollees in general (22%). PTSD is also associated with unusually high rates of smoking cessation treatment failure. The disparity in smoking cessation outcomes amongst veterans with PTSD may occur because standard smoking cessation treatment does not address PTSD-specific vulnerabilities. Veterans with smoking-PTSD comorbidity may respond optimally to treatment that addresses PTSD and associated affective symptoms, because such symptoms can both reinforce smoking and undermine quit attempts. Recent evidence shows that behavioral activation therapy (BA), a behavioral treatment that increases engagement in reinforcing activities, significantly reduces PTSD symptoms. BA may improve smoking cessation outcomes amongst veterans with PTSD because it reduces overall PTSD symptom severity and affective distress (low positive affect, high negative affect), which can cause smoking relapse. The proposed research will determine whether BA as an adjunct to standard smoking cessation treatment (ST+BA) is superior to a comparably intense combination of standard smoking cessation treatment + health and smoking education (ST+HSE) in improving smoking cessation outcomes among veterans with PTSD. The HSE intervention is intended to constitute a credible intervention that controls for contact time. Secondary objectives are to determine if BA improves PTSD symptomatology and associated affective distress, and to identify potential mediators of BA on smoking outcomes.  Methods: A total of 120 veterans with PTSD who are motivated to quit smoking will attend an initial diagnostic and baseline assessment session. Those who are interested, eligible, and who provide consent will be randomly assigned to receive ST+BA or ST+HSE and will be contacted by their individual study therapist to schedule the first treatment session. Participants will be stratified into treatment groups based on: 1) major depressive disorder (MDD; present versus absent), and 2) PTSD symptom severity. All participants will receive eight, individual sessions of ST+BA or ST+HSE. All participants will receive 20 minutes of identical standard smoking cessation treatment in each of the eight sessions. Those in the ST+BA condition will receive an additional 30 minutes of behavioral activation therapy; those in the ST+HSE condition will receive an additional 30 minutes of health education and information about smoking. All participants will receive 8 weeks of the nicotine patch. Smoking cessation outcomes will be assessed 2, 4, 8, 16, and 26 weeks after the quit date.  Significance: This research has important clinical and public health significance because smoking is especially common among veterans with PTSD and it is the leading preventable cause of disease and disability. Reducing smoking rates among veterans with PTSD would result in substantially lower smoking-related illness and death in this vulnerable group of smokers. It would also reduce tobacco related healthcare costs charged to the VA. Study methods and findings may potentially be extended to smoking cessation treatment for patients with mental health disorders other than PTSD."
"9468180","Heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity for both men and women, accounting for nearly 1 in 4 deaths. Consequently, there is an increasing need for strategies to generate human cardiomyocytes that are suitable for studies to benefit our understanding and care for patients with heart disease, including cardiotoxicity testing, drug target identification, and the development of personalized treatment strategies. Using modern differentiation protocols, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) are a renewable source for the rapid and large-scale production of cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CM). However, outstanding challenges in the generation of hSPC-CM populations optimal for research and clinical applications include the difficulty in producing pure cultures of cardiomyocytes of a specific subtype and maturation stage. To overcome these limitations, a clinically relevant system that does not require genetic modifications to identify and isolate cardiomyocytes with defined functional properties is needed. Informative cell surface proteins and affinity reagents (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) that permit selection of in vitro derived cells at specific stages of differentiation with known functional properties represent a clinically viable solution to these problems. Analogous to what has been accomplished in the hematopoietic stem cell system, we hypothesize that cell surface proteins can be used to identify and select specific cell types within the context of cardiomyocyte differentiation. In support of our goals, we have used an innovative mass spectrometry approach that enables capture and identification of extracellular domains of cell surface proteins to identify >1300 surface proteins on hPSC-CM. Among these is a novel protein, novel cell surface protein (NCSP), that is robustly expressed in human heart. Phylogenetic analyses indicate NCSP emerged in species with four functional heart chambers and, despite having no predicted structural or functional domains, it?s sequence is highly conserved. We have generated novel anti-NCSP antibodies against unique epitopes present on the extracellular domain of NCSP and applied them to specifically detect it on cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Building on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that NCSP is an authentic cardiomyocyte cell surface marker that can be used to identify and sort live cells and has a significant cardiomyocyte function. There are two specific Aims to test this hypothesis: (Aim 1) To test the hypothesis that NCSP is a hPSC- CM cell surface marker which can be used to specifically identify and sort live cardiomyocytes. (Aim 2) To test the hypothesis that NCSP is required for the proper function of hPSC derived cardiomyocytes. Overall, the proposed studies will focus on understanding this in the context of cardiomycyte biology and will define the utility of novel monoclonal antibodies for immunophenotyping. More specifically, we will assess the utility of the antibodies for specifically identifying cardiomyocytes in vitro, will determine if this novel protein is required for in vitro differentiation."
"9293451","Toe amputations are often naively viewed as an inconsequential surgical procedure with little functional impact. Instead, a toe amputation is often the inciting event in a cascade of progressive loss of function and quality of life. One in three people undergoing toe amputations due to chronic illness fail to heal the amputation in a timely manner, requiring additional amputation surgery(ies) and one in five die in the following year. Inadequate healing may be related to suboptimal management of comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, depression and/or PTSD). Veterans with limited social support may be further limited in their ability to self-manage their illness and engage in treatment to facilitate healing and prevent additional amputation. Veterans who undergo r epeated amputations lose functional life years as they are hospitalized, recover from surgery, are re-hospitalized and undergo additional surgeries.  This 3-year study has three primary aims: 1) to characterize amputation trajectories and evaluate trends in subsequent amputation and death in the year after initial toe amputation overall, based on demographic characteristics, selected clinical factors (e.g., vascular status), and geographic location (e.g., Veterans Integrated Service Networks [VISN]), 2) to evaluate the associations between modifiable risk factors and 1-year risk of subsequent amputation or death while controlling for important risk factors that confound these associations, and 3) to acquire knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to secondary prevention using semi-structured interviews among patients who have undergone a toe amputation and providers who care for these patients to develop future interventions that improve outcomes in these patients. We will accomplish these goals by using the newly constructed VHA Amputee Registry/Repository, merged with relevant VA electronic medical record data, and in-depth interviews with providers and patients. Our proposed research ? a retrospective cohort study including all VHA patients (~16,000-19,000) with diabetes with a first ever toe amputation between FY 2005 and 2016 -- will be the largest study conducted to date, national in scope, and will supplement structured data with unstructured data to ascertain key information about not only the amputation but also other relevant patient characteristics. For Aim 1, frequencies and percentages of the following clinical outcomes will be obtained: subsequent amputation within 1-, 6-, and 12-months; counts of subsequent amputations; the final level of amputation at 12 months; and death. After evaluating crude rates, identifying and inspecting outliers, we will formally test for trends across time by including year as a predictor variable in logistic regression models, considering the use of piece-wise regression to allow for multiple slopes (non-linear trends). Similar models will be constructed to test for variation across VISN. Key modifiable risk factors for Aim 2 include behavioral factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol misuse), revascularization procedure and type (none, endovascular, and open), and adequacy of treatment mental health conditions (e.g., depression and post-traumatic stress disorder). For Aim 3, we will conduct in-depth interviews with providers and patients who have and have not undergone a subsequent amputation, to gain insight into patient and system-level barriers to successful healing, policies or other activities that could improve care for patients who undergo a toe amputation, and patient and provider perspectives on factors that they think would lead to improved patient outcomes. By conducting a detailed evaluation of temporal and geographic variation, identification of modifiable risk factors, and interviews with patients and providers, we will understand system-level and individual-level variation in outcomes.  Our study will lay the groundwork to re-position the PAVE program to incorporate toe/partial foot amputations into what has been a successful policy and program in the VA for decades."
"9406121","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human rod opsin gene (RHO) harbors many mutations that cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The folded opsin mRNA is a target for mutation-independent hammerhead ribozyme (hhRz) gene therapy for autosomal dominant (ad) RP. We achieved a potent hhRz candidate therapeutic for adRP that could treat all known human RHO mutations. The long-range goal is to translate effective hhRz therapeutics for RHO adRP into human clinical trials. The objective is to conduct a preclinical proof-of-materials test of this hhz agent and further optimized hhRz agents in mouse models of adRP that are humanized for RHO. The central hypothesis is that the reduction of toxic mutant RHO mRNA and protein will reduce photoreceptor stresses and reduce the rate or stop retinal degeneration due to mutant RHO (P347S). The rationale is that reduction of the P347S RHO mRNA and protein by the mutation-independent hhRz must be combined with reconstitution of wild type (WT) RHO expression (also reduced) to avoid compromise of photoreceptor vitality. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives the Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Use rational and evolutionary approaches to further optimize catalytic activity of our 725 GUC? human RHO hhRz within the current RNA scaffold. Expected results: By rigorously addressing hhRz RNA structure activity relations (SAR) we expect to manifest further potency-optimized lead hhRzs for preclinical trial and identify the optimum agent for clinical translation. Aim 2. Continue a simple preclinical test of the Knockdown hhRz strategy with rAAV packaged gene therapeutic agents by testing for rescue of retinal degeneration in a partially humanized murine model of adRP that expresses a human mutant rod opsin transgene on the mouse WT RHO background, and test toxicity in a fully humanized mouse model expressing only WT human RHO in mouse rod photoreceptors. RHO hhRz genes are delivered by recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). The adRP mouse has a slow outer retinal degeneration (~50% loss in 6 mo.) that offers a temporal window for therapeutic rescue. Expected results: suppression of toxic mutant RHO will rescue photoreceptors and retinal degeneration. The WT human RHO model has no degeneration and allows test of toxicity related to RHO reduction. Expected results: ERG sensitivity shifts and possible demise of WT photoreceptors will depend on levels of RHO reduction. Aim 3. Test the lead hhRz agent and a reconstituting human WT RHO allele for rescue in a humanized adRP model in which human mutant and WT RHO mRNAs are expressed in mouse rod photoreceptors. Expected results: rescue of retinal degeneration in the fully humanized adRP. The plan is innovative with novel rational and directed evolutionary strategies to improve the existing lead hhRz, and novel mouse models humanized for target mRNAs to simulate human clinical trial. Significance- successful rescue in humanized adRP mouse models would provide safety and efficacy outcomes to support clinical translation of this gene therapy approach for human RHO adRP."
"9552990","Abstract African Americans (AA) are overburdened with hypertension compared to other racial groups in the United States. The disorder often takes on a more severe form including earlier onset, resistance to treatment, and earlier end organ damage suggesting the need for personalized medicine strategies for prevention and treatment in this group. Observational studies and clinical trials have shown that commonly used antihypertensive agents exert variable blood pressure (BP) lowering effects in ethnic populations. For example, compared to Caucasians, AAs exhibit significantly poorer BP lowering response to beta-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB's), and a much better response to calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics when used as monotherapy. The eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure suggests calcium channel blockers and diuretics should be the first-line antihypertensive therapy for AAs. However, data show there is more variation in response to antihypertensive treatment classes within race groups than between them. Despite the clinical reliance on thiazide diuretics for AAs, no large scale pharmacogenetic discovery effort has been undertaken. Furthermore, there are concerns regarding metabolic side effects for this drug class, including abnormal glucose tolerance and hypokalemia. This is of particular importance to patients of African ancestry, who have a higher risk of developing diabetes, and often need to start treatment at a younger age. More than half of published pharmacogenetic studies do not include AAs, and, among those that do, the average sample size is small (<200). In order to overcome the limitations of previous research and enable genetic discovery of genes and variants which predict blood pressure response as well as metabolic response to thiazide diuretic, we will leverage data and specimens from 4830 AAs randomized to chlorthalidone from the Genetics of Hypertension Associated Treatment (GenHAT) study, an ancillary study of the Antihypertensive and Lipid lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). Genomic discovery will be enriched for African Ancestry genetic variations, functional variation, as well as known pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic variants. We have established an agreement with the International Consortium for Antihypertensives Pharmacogenomics Studies (ICAPS) for validation of our findings. Genes associated with thiazide diuretic response will be evaluated for association with cardiovascular disease outcomes in AAs from GENHAT and the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke Study (REGARDS). In sum, the project will shed light on the mechanisms of thiazide diuretic response; potentially identify new treatment targets; and identify genetic markers which can optimize treatment in this high risk population."
"9412192","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines and efficacious therapies, however, many patients do not achieve the full benefit of CVD risk reduction. In particular, complex patients (defined as those patients who do not respond to current disease management approaches) with multiple concurrent chronic conditions represent a key segment of the population that would benefit from new approaches to care. In response to PA-12-024: Behavioral Interventions to Address Multiple Chronic Conditions in Primary Care, which seeks practical interventions...to modify behaviors using a common approach among patients with multiple co-morbidities, we propose to implement and rigorously evaluate an integrated behavioral intervention designed to improve a core set of chronic disease self-management skills and to overcome common barriers to care engagement encountered by this increasingly important segment of the U.S. adult primary care population. This randomized trial will be conducted within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated care delivery system serving over 3.2 million members, including patients insured through Medicare and state Medicaid programs. We will evaluate our intervention in 3 KPNC primary care practices by enrolling 576 complex patients who have persistently (e 2 years) uncontrolled CVD risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes) despite being enrolled in a CVD disease management program. This behavioral intervention is designed to activate and engage patients, identify potentially hidden barriers to care such as alcohol misuse or sub-clinical depression, and to develop individualized care plans that are designed to catalyze more effective primary care management. Randomization will be at the patient-level, blocked by primary care provider, with the following aims: 1) To examine the impact of (intervention + usual care) vs. (usual care alone) on control of systolic blood pressure [primary outcome], LDL cholesterol, Framingham Risk Score (if no baseline CVD), and HbA1c (if with diabetes) at 12 months; 2) To examine effectiveness of (intervention + usual care) vs. (usual care alone) on proximal outcomes (patient activation, medication adherence, and mental health status) after 3 and 12 months, and 3) To identify baseline patient factors associated with more vs. less successful clinical response among intervention arm patients. By focusing on core health skills and care barriers, this patient-focused intervention seeks to enable complex patients to become more effective agents of their own care and to thereby achieve similar clinical benefits as less complex patients."
"9393233","PROJECT SUMMARY Compelling evidence has arisen on the role of neighborhood deprivation and childhood psychosocial adversity in cardiovascular health. Investigations into neighborhood health effects have identified two broad domains of neighborhood attributes that may be relevant to health: neighborhood physical environment and neighborhood social environment. Furthermore, early childhood is a critical stage in the life course during which inputs received can set health-related behaviors that may have long lasting impacts. Most of the current research has only investigated cross-sectional associations between neighborhood deprivation and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, which does not test the temporal assumption of causality. The proposed research will fill gaps in the literature using data from the New England Family Study (NEFS), a longitudinal investigation of risk factors for adult medical issues that may have early childhood developmental origins. Participants were followed since birth until adulthood in Providence, RI and Boston, MA, two of the most densely inhabited metropolitan areas in the Northeastern United States. Participants? lifetime residential history will be geocoded and linked to neighborhood factors across the life course. The resulting dataset will allow the research team to examine two aspects of neighborhood deprivation: neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES), and accessibility to green space, using multilevel models. Outcomes will include two major CVD risk factors across the life course: high blood pressure (HBP) and body mass index (BMI). The proposed study will address three aims to evaluate: 1) Longitudinal associations of NSES with HBP and BMI; 2) Longitudinal associations of neighborhood accessibility to green space with HBP and BMI; and 3) The extent to which childhood adversity modifies the longitudinal association of neighborhood deprivation with HBP and BMI. We hypothesize that participants experiencing childhood adversity in households in deprived neighborhoods are a high-risk subset of the population that should be prioritized. In addition, this study will make available neighborhood data to pursue spatial questions at a level of detail and with methodologies not previously accessible in the NEFS; and not available in most longitudinal observational studies. Results from this longitudinal study may provide new evidence that during critical periods of susceptibility in life, greater access to neighborhood green space and higher NSES may slow the development of CVD in middle- aged adults.

"9617307","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center was founded as a matrix center within the Duke University School of Medicine in 1972 and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) was created as a new administrative entity within Duke Medicine in October, 2010, with authority and responsibility for all cancer-related activities at Duke University and in the Duke University Health System. The DCI was started with significant investments from Duke Medicine, including a new $243M clinical care outpatient facility, over $60 million of new funds available to support new initiatives, a formula for ongoing investment by the Duke Health System to support ongoing and new DCI initiatives, and additional laboratory and office-based research space. These new commitments were in addition to the clinical space and administrative and Shared Resource lab space already under DCI control and the many laboratories in the Duke School of Medicine and University housing DCI members. The first DCI Executive Director, Michael Kastan, M.D., Ph.D., was hired in August, 2011, followed by major changes in administrative infrastructure, leadership positions and roles, and Cancer Center committees. CCSG Programs and Shared Resources were re-organized, investments were made in high-priority areas, and mechanisms established to more effectively facilitate communication and collaborations among DCI faculty. The DCI, which currently consists of 354 members from 25 departments within 5 schools at Duke University (Medicine, Nursing, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, and Business), promotes collaborations between faculty and staff involved in cancer care, research, and education within both Duke University and the Duke University Health System. It is organized as 9 multi-disciplinary research programs (2 basic discovery, 1 population science, and 6 translational) whose work is supported by 13 Shared Resources (8 lab-based and 5 supporting translational/ clinical/ population research activities). On average, approximately 6000 new cancer patients are seen each year at Duke University Hospital (DUH); during the previous 5 calendar years, an average of approximately 1900 patients per year were enrolled on therapeutic clinical trials at DUH and partner sites, the vast majority of which were at DUH. Almost two-thirds of the DCI therapeutic clinical trials represent early phase research (pilot, phase I, phase II). DCI members are supported by over $242M of external cancer- related grant support, $160M of which is peer-reviewed. DCI grant support includes 51 multi-investigator projects and 91 training and fellowship awards. DCI members published over 8000 papers in peer-reviewed journals during the past funding period, ~39% of which represent collaborative efforts between DCI investigators (12% intra-program, 21% inter-program, and 6% both). The DCI will continue to utilize effective oversight and strategic planning to integrate all cancer-related activities in it purview, from basic research to translational studies to clinical and population investigation to patient care to community outreach to regional/national strategies to global cancer."
"9447721","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), an epidemic disease, affecting 5.7 million American adults, and the incidence is projected to increase by 46% by 2030. HF is a progressive disease along a continuum from asymptomatic (stage A and B) to symptomatic (stage C and D). Because of the substantial risk of incident HF in patients with asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction, it is imperative to develop effective interventions at the early stage of HF. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a novel therapy that decreases HF hospitalization and mortality, and improves LV systolic function and HF symptoms. The effectiveness of CRT in patients with mild LV systolic dysfunction?EF of 36%-50% with LBBB?has not been determined. It is unknown whether early resynchronization will prevent LVEF deterioration and reverse ventricular metabolic remodeling. Heterogeneous nature of myocardial metabolism, dyssynchrony and deficient myocardial energy distribution and consumption are hallmarks of HF precipitating myocardial dysfunction. However, the effects of CRT on myocardial energy and substrate metabolism and which metabolic state and pathways facilitate myocardial recovery are unknown. Moreover, the metabolomics signatures of LBBB and metabolic pathways affected in delayed conduction area at the LV lateral wall have not been determined. Furthermore, women may benefit from CRT more than men in terms of improved survival, HF events, and reverse LV remodeling. Yet the metabolic mechanisms underlying favorable CRT outcomes in women have not been elucidated. Metabolomic monitoring of patient body fluids and cardiac-specific coronary sinus blood is of key importance for precision medicine and is included in NIH Roadmap. Accordingly, by analyzing metabolomics patterns in severe and mild HF in the presence of LBBB along with gender and ischemic-non-ischemic HF differences in CRT outcome we will discover metabolic mechanisms which favor the recovery of cardiac function. This study will use stable isotope 18O-based metabolomic technologies and transcardiac metabolic mapping to understand how CRT improves cardiac metabolism and to identify metabolic pathways and novel metabolomic biomarkers that may predict restoration of LV systolic function by CRT. With a cross-over study design, the role of acyl- carnitines, branched chain amino acids and blood phosphometabolite turnover rates will be examined as early biomarkers in relation to LV dysfunction. The study will include three aims. Aim 1: To determine early alteration in metabolic pathways and metabolomics biomarkers in patients with mild HF and LBBB, and their role in the prediction of outcomes of early CRT. Aim 2: To characterize metabolic remodeling pathways in severe ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and to determine mechanistic associations with response to CRT. Aim 3: To determine the myocardial metabolomics traits and metabolic mechanisms that underlie a favorable response to CRT in women."
"9563758","Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments."
"9412435","  Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex, multifactorial autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy in skin and various internal organs such as the lungs, kidneys and heart disease with no specific treatment. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a common complication of SSc, and compared to other subgroups of PAH patients, responds poorly to currently approved vasodilators. Oxidative damage is a well- defined component of lung disease in SSc as well as in other organs and pathology studies have shown evidence of oxidative damage in SSc lungs. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), recently been approved as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, triggers the general response to oxidative damage through Nrf2, resulting in the induction of multiple enzymes designed to counteract the oxidative process. DMF reduces inflammation driven by the NF?B pathway, especially in endothelial cells. Preclinical studies by our group as well as other groups have shown that DMF inhibits PAH in murine models. In addition multiple markers of oxidative stress are elevated in patients with SSc and SSc-PAH, suggesting that this is an important pathway mediating vascular damage in SSc-PAH. On the basis of these studies, we propose a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of DMF added to stable background, standard of care PAH therapy in SSc?PAH patients, comparing the change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 24 weeks to baseline in DMF compared to placebo treated patients. We will recruit 34 patients from three centers with large SSc and PAH patient populations at University of Pittsburgh, Boston University and Johns Hopkins Medical Centers to account for up to 20% dropout, leaving 28 patients for analysis. We will also study safety to ensure no unexpected adverse effects are related to DMF in these patients  To provide further information about target engagement and reinforce potential clinical efficacy, we will examine biomarkers of oxidative stress and of PAH. To assess the effect of DMF on markers of SSc-PAH, we will compare changes from baseline to 24-weeks in levels of B-type natriuretic peptide, Endostatin, Endothelin- 1, Endoglin, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, von Willebrand Factor, and Vascular Cellular Adhesion Molecule 1, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cell RNA expression biomarkers: IL13RA1, CCR1, JAK2 and MRC, comparing DMF to placebo treated patients. We will examine the performance of each of these markers as potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers by comparing their levels longitudinally to changes in 6MWD. To assess the effect of DMF treatment on markers of oxidative stress, we will measure markers of lipid, DNA, and prostaglandin oxidation, comparing changes after treatment to baseline levels in DMF compared to placebo treated patients. In addition, we will measure markers of NF?B activation, IL-6 and CCL2, again comparing changes in levels in DMF to placebo treated patients. These studies should provide strong clinical support for larger phase 2/3 studies of DMF for SSc-PAH in the future. They should also provide new insight into the mechanism of action of DMF in humans."
"9406327","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over a million Americans suffer a heart attack (myocardial infarction) each year. For the majority who survive the initial event, the risks of serious complications such as infarct rupture and heart failure depend on the structure and mechanical properties of the scar tissue that replaces damaged heart muscle over the first few weeks. That scar tissue is produced by cardiac fibroblasts, and we recently showed that scar structure and mechanical properties are strongly influenced by mechanical stretch during healing. The biology of how fibroblasts respond to individual signals such as mechanical stretch has been studied extensively; yet we still understand relatively little about how fibroblasts integrate and respond to the multiple signals present in a healing wound. We therefore developed an agent-based model (ABM) of scar formation that represents individual fibroblasts - each migrating, aligning, depositing and remodeling collagen, dividing, dying, and responding to individual chemical, structural, and mechanical signals according to experimental measurements - and predicts the resulting evolution of tissue-level collagen content and fiber alignment in scars healing under different patterns of stretch. Here, we propose to couple this ABM with a finite-element model (FEM) of the infarct left ventricle to produce a coupled model that can predict the dynamic interplay between evolving scar structure, scar mechanics, and heart function after infarction and in response to therapies that alter infarct mechanics (Aim 1). Then, we will use a combination of experiments and modeling to better understand the cellular mechanisms by which mechanical stretch regulates collagen content and alignment in healing myocardial infarcts. Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that mechanical regulation of collagen degradation significantly influences collagen content and alignment during mechanical unloading (Aim 2) and that scar compaction significantly influences collagen fiber density but not in-plane fiber alignment across a range of loading conditions (Aim 3). The proposed studies are potentially significant both because they will generate the first validated, predictive model of infarct healing across a range of mechanical conditions - enabling computational screening and design of novel therapies - and because they will provide important new insight into the cellular mechanisms by which mechanical environment regulates scar formation, which could lead to the identification of new therapeutic approaches to modulating infarct healing."
"9529771","Abstract  Regulation of the immune response is critical for human health. Deregulated immunity can result in diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. CD4 T cells are the generals of the immune response, directing function of other immune cells to best combat infection. They accomplish this by responding to signals provided by pathogen that direct changes in gene expression. These changes drive their proliferation and differentiation into specific CD4 T helper (Th) cell subsets. To thwart inappropriate and overzealous immunity, control mechanisms have evolved that limit the function of Th cells. These include immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells as well as Th cell-intrinsic mechanisms that prevent over-expression of inflammatory cytokines. When one or more of these mechanisms fail, it can lead to disease. For example, insufficient Treg cell function as well as over- expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as GM-CSF and IFN? by Th cells has been linked to autoimmunity and pathological inflammation. Defining regulatory factors and pathways that are required for erecting these barriers will lead to illumination of new avenues for therapies to combat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Published reports by us and others, as well as preliminary data using a new mouse model system, provide strong evidence that the transcriptional regulator Ikaros plays an important, non- redundant role in these processes. Defining the mechanisms by which it does so is the focus of this proposal.  Ikaros is expressed at high levels in CD4 T cells, as well as in all blood cell lineages from the level of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). Mice with a germline knockout mutation in Ikaros (Ikaros null mice) display defects in HSC function as well as in development and/or function of all blood cell lineages studied to date. While much has been reported about the mechanisms underlying Ikaros' role in regulating programs of gene expression in HSCs and bone marrow progenitor cells using these mice, little is known about how Ikaros functions to regulate gene expression in mature, peripheral T cells. This is due to the fact that Ikaros null mice have profound defects in T cell maturation in the thymus and develop T cell leukemia by five weeks of age, making them an inappropriate system for these studies. We have developed an Ikaros conditional knockout mouse and, using this model, knocked out Ikaros expression specifically in mature T cells. CD4 T cells from these mice have defects in proliferation and survival, defective inducible Treg and T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation, and over-express pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we propose to use these mice to define Ikaros-dependent transcriptional networks that control pathways regulating Th cell differentiation and proliferation using a transcriptomics approach. It is our hope that these studies will define novel pathways involved in regulation of CD4 T cell function that will translate into new areas for disease intervention."
"9398105","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AML is a devastating blood tumor, the most common type of leukemia in adults, a disease that continues to have the lowest survival rate within leukemia. Nearly 45,000 people are diagnosed each year in the US, and the current 5-year survival frequency is only 24% with an almost 50% relapse rate after treatment. AML is a part of a wider family of myeloid neoplasms that include diverse but related diseases like myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a disease that frequently develops into AML. Currently, there are no targeted therapies for most of these diseases, including AML, making the study of the molecular mechanisms of their induction and progression of great significance. We have recently identified novel somatically acquired mutations inactivating the Notch signaling pathway in patients with CMML. Interestingly, these Notch mutations do not act in isolation but they co-occur with additional genomic hits, including mutations on the TET2, ASXL1, KRAS and JAK2 genes. Our published and preliminary data presented here demonstrate that: a) The Notch pathway is switched-off in myelo-monocytic leukemias, including AML, b) Inhibition of the pathway is achieved both by inactivating mutations and epigenetic silencing, c) Re-activation of the pathway can inhibit the growth of mouse CMML in vivo and human AML in vitro. In this application we: a) Assess the biological effects of Notch pathway re- activation in AML, b) Identify the molecular and epigenetic mode of pathway inhibition in human AML and c) Study co-operation of Notch pathway mutations with additional genomic lesions and their effect in AML initiation and progression. We strongly believe that these studies can lead to future targeted therapies of AML and related myeloid neoplasms, as re-activation of the Notch pathway can be achieved using both peptide and antibody agonist approaches."
"9444099","ABSTRACT Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), continues to take a severe toll on world health, and the number of drug resistant TB cases is growing. Thus, there is a significant need to develop new TB drugs that target novel pathways of Mtb. Mce transporters are mycobacterial lipid uptake pathways that function in Mtb pathogenesis. More specifically, the Mce4 transporter imports host cholesterol, which is known to be utilized by Mtb during infection. Consequently, Mce transporters are a potential target for TB drug development. However, we lack even the most basic details of how Mce transporters work.  Mce transporters appear likely to be highly complex systems involving numerous components. Along with two proposed permeases, each mce operon encodes six Mce proteins that are proposed to function as solute binding proteins that bind lipid. However, no single Mce protein has been studied for a function in transport and not a single protein-protein interaction is known for Mce transporters. Adjacent to mce operons there are pairs of genes encoding Mam (Mce-associated membrane) proteins and orphaned mam (omam) genes that are unlinked from mce loci also exist. We recently identified an orphaned Mam (OmamA), which is the only Mam/Omam studied to date, as functioning in Mce transporters through a role involving stabilization of Mce proteins. OmamA and other Mam/Omam proteins may have roles analogous to that of VirB8, which functions in assembly and stabilization of Gram negative Type IV secretion systems (T4SSs), as Omam, Mam and VirB8 proteins are predicted to be structurally similar.  We hypothesize that Mce transporters are large macromolecular complexes that span the cell wall, akin to T4SSs, with each of the Mce proteins having unique functions and Mam/Omam proteins being additional components that function in stabilization and/or assembly of the complex. In this developmental R21, we will use the M. smegmatis Mce4 transporter as a model system to perform a systematic analysis of the requirements of individual Mce and Mam/Omam proteins. We will also identify the first examples of functional residues and domains in these Mce transporter components and identify protein interactions and Mce transporter complexes in mycobacteria. Through establishing the core properties of Mce systems these studies will significantly advance our current understanding of these important transport pathways and improve our knowledge of lipid transport in diverse bacteria. Our results may additionally reveal strategies for inhibiting lipid uptake by Mce transporters that could serve as the basis of novel TB therapeutics."
"9404449","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to determine whether and why the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) menu labeling requirement impacts obesity by examining changes in consumer behavior and restaurant menus. Due to the relationship between eating outside of the home and obesity and the difficulty of consumers in accurately determining the nutritional content of menu items, the ACA requires chain restaurants to post calorie information on menus. This requirement will be implemented on December 1, 2015 and builds upon similar state and local laws first implemented in 2008. Preliminary evidence suggests that changes in body mass index (BMI) over time in counties that previously introduced a menu labeling requirement fell in recent years relative to nearby counties. In contrast, prior research on local menu labeling laws primarily examines changes in items ordered at large chain restaurants and generally finds small or no changes in the amount of calories purchased after calorie counts are posted on menus. Such a narrow focus misses numerous other potential changes in restaurant menus and consumer behavior due to these requirements. This project significantly expands on the prior literature by examining the nationwide implementation of the ACA's menu labeling requirement and examining the broader impacts of this requirement on behavior. Specifically, this project will evaluate the impact of the ACA's menu labeling requirement on (1) restaurant menu offerings and prices, (2) consumer eating habits, (3) physical activity, and (4) body mass index and obesity. Difference-in-differences comparisons over time before and after the implementation of the menu labeling requirement among groups affected by the requirement and groups not affected will provide estimates of the impact of menu labeling. Affected restaurants are chains with 20 or more locations that did not voluntarily previously post calories on menus and are located in areas without a prior local mandate. Affected consumers are individuals living in counties or states without a pre-ACA calorie posting mandate. To construct these estimates, this project will involve collecting and analyzing menus and nutritional content from chain restaurants, surveying consumers in areas with prior calories posting mandates and surrounding regions and analyzing the resulting data, and analyzing data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The expected outcomes of this project are an understanding of the impact of greater access to information in the form of calorie posting requirements on obesity and the mechanisms through which calorie posting influences obesity. Thus, this project will inform policymakers and researchers about whether and how the calorie posting mandate in the Affordable Care Act impacts obesity rates."

"9487517","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most common hospital-acquired infection worldwide, with an annual cost of approximately $451 million in the United States and an additional $2,900 per CAUTI- related bacteremia. Up to 86% of CAUTIs are polymicrobial, and CAUTI-related bacteremia is also often polymicrobial and carries a high mortality rate. Despite these clinical findings, experimental investigations have focused on single bacterial species in isolation. There is a fundamental gap in understanding of the influence of polymicrobial colonization on transition from asymptomatic bacteriuria to symptomatic CAUTI and the underlying mechanisms of progression from bladder and kidney colonization to bacteremia. Addressing these gaps in knowledge will be critical for developing new therapeutics and intervention strategies to reduce the incidence of CAUTI and enhance quality of life for catheterized individuals. The objective of this career development plan is to complement the candidate's background in bacterial polymicrobial interactions with training in experimental models of CAUTI, innate immunity, histopathology, clinical CAUTI research methods, and next generation sequencing techniques to establish an independent, translational research program investigating the pathogenesis of polymicrobial CAUTI. The central hypothesis of this proposal, guided by substantial preliminary data, is that polymicrobial colonization increases the incidence of bacteremia due to host cell damage from a potent innate immune response and synergistic production of virulence factors. This hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims that include utilizing a coinfection model developed by the candidate to 1) quantify bladder and kidney damage and identify host factors that contribute to cell damage and progression to bacteremia during coinfection, 2) identify bacterial virulence factors that contribute to bladder and kidney damage and progression to bacteremia during coinfection, and 3) analyze urine cultures and patient-level data from catheterized individuals to determine the influence of polymicrobial colonization on development of CAUTI and adverse outcomes such as bacteremia. An innovative, comprehensive model of polymicrobial infection will be developed through integration of experimental bacterial pathogenesis studies, innate immunity, histopathology, bioinformatics, clinical data, and patient samples. This research is significant because it will assess the influence of polymicrobial colonization on development of adverse and costly CAUTI complications, identify the most problematic bacterial species that correlate with adverse outcomes, and identify host and bacterial targets for therapeutic intervention. The knowledge gained will inform development of intervention strategies to reduce colonization by the most problematic bacterial species and to reduce the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria. The distinguished mentoring team assembled by the candidate combined with the environment at the University of Michigan will provide exceptional training and support for the proposed study and the candidate's transition to independence."
"9466742","ABSTRACT  Redbud Labs proposes to develop a low-cost, integrated microfluidic system to purify and concentrate pathogens directly from 10 mL of whole blood, with the goal of improving the sensitivity of downstream blood culture and molecular diagnostic assays used in sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Phase I studies have demonstrated that our technology, based on actuated surface attached posts (ASAPs), can achieve high binding efficiency from a complex matrix, such as whole blood, without fouling. Our goal for this Phase II project is to develop a working prototype of the pathogen purification system, validate the system using clinical blood samples, and prepare for scale-up.  The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) develop an integrated pathogen purification system, (2) validate the system using clinical samples, and (3) optimize ASAP fabrication methods to support scalable production. Prior to commencing the work in Phase II, we will complete an Aim 0 which focuses on evaluating the binding chemistry efficiency of the capture chamber, using the broad-spectrum MBL antibody (that can bind >90% of pathogens that infect blood) in place of the E.coli-specific antibody used in Phase I studies. The integrated system in Phase II will be validated using opportunistic clinical blood samples that are routinely collected from patients admitted to the ICU at Duke University Hospital. Additionally, process development, such as wafer-level surface functionalization, ASAP packaging for integration with a cartridge format, and shelf stability studies will be conducted to ensure expected product performance by the time it reaches the end user.  The outcome of this project will be an integrated, inexpensive, and simple system that could transform the current status of pathogen identification and drug susceptibility testing, particularly for rare and low number pathogens in blood. The broader impact of this system is the simplification of capture, recovery and concentration of any analyte from whole blood which could improve the speed and sensitivity of in vitro diagnostics."
"9390246","Project Summary / Abstract Episodic memory plays an integral role in human cognitive functioning and overall life success. Thus, proper emergence of episodic memory is a crucial part of typical development. Early childhood marks a time window in which gains in episodic memory are greatest. The goal of this project is to identify and characterize the component cognitive processes of episodic memory, their relative developmental trajectories, and the structural connectivity of memory neural network in young children. In service of this goal, three studies with specific, achievable objectives are proposed. [First, we will examine pattern separation and relational memory ? both have been theorized to be cornerstone processes of episodic memory ? in one task to assess their relative contribution to episodic memory development. Second, we integrate both processes by examining the developmental changes of relational memory as a function of pattern separation demand for contexts.] Third, we will relate episodic memory improvements to age-related differences in brain structural connectivity between regions involved in episodic memory. We hypothesize that pattern separation as well as relational memory develops significantly with age and will account for unique variances in episodic memory performance. We also hypothesize that gains in episodic memory during this age window is accompanied by age-related differences in the structural connectivity of memory neural network. This project will help inform prevention and intervention by targeting the appropriate component cognitive processes involved in various physical and mental health conditions in which episodic memory is compromised."
"9450757","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vibrio cholerae infection continues to be a life-threatening concern in regions with crowded living conditions and poor sanitation. The emergence of El Tor variant, a strain that exhibits enhanced cholera toxin (CT) production and innate immune activation, necessitates examination of the factors that contribute to increased disease severity in recent outbreaks. CT elicits production and secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), serotonin (5-HT), and numerous cytokines that may not only regulate intestinal fluid transport, but may also contribute to the innate immune response. In our novel observation, the CT B subunit was found to induce cell cycle arrest in actively dividing intestinal stem/progenitor cells, and we hypothesize that this phenomenon may arise from the same signaling that yields PGE2, 5-HT, cAMP, or cytokine release. To facilitate mechanistic studies of CT- induced biomolecule secretion and cell cycle arrest, we will employ primary untransformed human enteroids derived from adult stem cells of the intestine. We have developed a method to grow human enteroids as 2- dimensional epithelial monolayers, overcoming the limitation of 3-dimensional cultures that prevents direct access to the polarized apical cell surface. This K01 proposal will establish understanding of CT-mediated innate immune response and cell cycle dysregulation using the enteroid monolayer model in the following aims: We will 1) identify how CT induces PGE2 synthesis and IL-8 secretion through CRISPR/Cas9- guided receptor knock-outs, pharmacological inhibitor studies, and secreted PGE2 and cytokine ELISA. Using a recently reported method to enrich enteroid cultures with the enterochromaffin cell lineage, we will 2) determine how CT increases extracellular 5-HT and how this contributes to cytokine release. This will include evaluation of direct or indirect stimulation of 5-HT secretion, function of the serotonin transporter (SERT), and enterocyte 5-HT receptor roles in cytokine production. Finally, we will 3) determine the origin and duration of CT-induced cell cycle arrest using EdU incorporation, FACS analysis of cell cycle phase, and RNA-Seq to compare transcriptional changes induced by CT, CTB, PGE2, 5-HT, cAMP, and specific cytokines. Not only will these aims advance understanding of CT-induced pathophysiology with potential clinical significance, but they will also foster technical skill development in cytokine detection/quantitation, CRISPR/Cas9-driven gene editing, and computational bioinformatics to analyze RNA-Seq data. My advisory committee of highly qualified scientific and professional role models and the resource-rich environment in the Division of Gastroenterology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine will guide my development from a mentored researcher to an independent scientist in the field of diarrheal diseases and intestinal stem cell effects caused by enteric microbial pathogens."
"9469819","Project Summary: Despite decades of research into the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias, both lethal and non-lethal manifestations of disrupted cardiac disruption continue to take the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans and impose staggering financial costs [1]. The proposed project seeks to resolve a controversy in the field of cardiac electrophysiology regarding the roles extracellular spaces play in cardiac conduction. Briefly, gap junctional coupling is regarded as the primary mechanism of cardiac conduction, by which electrical signals in the heart propagate from cell to cell in a manner similar to electrical cables[2-4]. Recently, our lab has investigated a potentially complementary mechanism known as ephaptic coupling [5-8] which, when disrupted, can unmask diseases related to gap junctional uncoupling [9, 10]. Ephaptic coupling has been demonstrated to be modulated by the structure of the gap-junction- adjacent perinexus nanodomain and the ionic composition of the fluid in that space [9-13]. This evidence suggests that these primary factors of ephaptic coupling can be modulated by a method as simple and inexpensive as changing the ions contained in a bag of IV fluid to which a patient is connected in a hospital or ambulance. However, there is still debate in the field as to which mechanisms are affected, and in what ways, by extracellular expansion or collapse, both of which occur in a myriad of disease states [14, 15]. Interstitial expansion has been shown to both increase [3] and decrease [13] cardiac conduction velocity, by mechanisms attributed to cable and ephaptic theories, respectively. The proposed study aims to identify key mechanisms affected by interventions demonstrated in both of the above studies, specifically the expansion of bulk interstitium which would improve cable-like conduction and the narrowing of the perinexus, which would theoretically enhance ephaptic coupling. Identifying which parameters ? interstitial volume and perinexal width ? correlate with improved conduction will provide the field with targetable mechanisms of conduction preservation in the case of edema or ischemic events."
"9612615","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary Recent technological advances in genome sequencing have enabled numerous large-scale association studies aimed at discovering genetic variants underlying a wide array of complex diseases. It has become increasingly evident that the majority of these associations stem from a perturbation of regulatory function. While the ENCODE project and related efforts have strengthened our ability to comprehensively identify regulatory elements, our ability to decipher the impact of individual variants within these elements has not kept step. To address this gap, I aim to develop and apply the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to empirically test the regulatory potential of thousands of individual variant sites for a wide range of roles. My specific aims are to: (1) Demonstrate the utility of MPRA by applying the method to loci in the human genome with evidence of recent positive selection and those identified in published genome wide association studies; (2) Modify MPRA to capture a more comprehensive array of regulatory mechanisms; and (3) Transition the current MPRA episomal vector to a viral delivery platform, allowing for chromosomal integration. I anticipate that these methods will provide the broader research community with a catalog of biologically meaningful regulatory variants and a valuable toolkit for understanding the role that regulatory variation plays in human health and disease."
"9407039","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern diagnostics and treatments for inherited and acquired cardiovascular diseases require in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms that control heart cell identity during embryonic development. In mammals, the facial and lower jaw muscles - collectively referred to as pharyngeal muscles - share a common origin with heart progenitors in the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm. This relationship is reflected in the DiGeorge syndrome, where altered Tbx1 function causes cardiovascular and craniofacial malformations. The heart vs. pharyngeal muscle fate choice is difficult to study in the early mammalian embryos, as is the cellular environment, a.k.a. niche, which determines whether cardiopharyngeal progenitor cells remain multipotent or become specified into either cardiac or pharyngeal muscles. Larvae of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, a marine invertebrate among the closest relatives to the vertebrates, possess a simplified cardiopharyngeal lineage of cells that make successive heart vs. pharyngeal muscles choices in a simple and stereotyped manner. This can be studied with high spatiotemporal resolution using targeted molecular perturbations, confocal microscopy and lineage- specific transcription profiling that combines fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The ascidian cardiopharyngeal mesoderm arises from two progenitors, which produce the heart and the atrial siphon muscles (ASM) that control the exhalant opening. It was found that bipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors undergo oriented asymmetrical cell divisions that produce distinct first and second heart precursors and ASM precursors. Molecularly, the cardiopharyngeal progenitors display multilineage transcriptional priming, i.e. they activate both early cardiac and ASM programs. These then segregate to their corresponding precursors due to regulatory cross-antagonisms: early ASM regulators inhibit the heart program in ASM precursors, while the ASM program is inhibited in the heart precursors. Here, regulatory mechanisms governing progressive ASM fate specification will be analyzed by testing the hypothesis that feedforward regulatory circuits control sequential gene activation. Next, the hypothesis that the orientation of asymmetric cell division determines differential interaction between a specific niche and the ASM vs. heart precursors will be explored. Finally, defined tissue-specific molecular perturbations, FACS and RNA-seq assays, including from single-cell samples, will define transcriptional signatures for multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors, first and second heart precursors and early ASM precursors. These results will characterize the regulatory properties that define cardiopharyngeal multipotency and uncover mechanisms that regulate conserved heart vs. pharyngeal muscle fate choices in chordates."
"9457606","Title: Novel, Noninvasive, Rapid Tumor Ablation Technology using Histotripsy Abstract Our goal is to develop a noninvasive ablation technique that can achieve rapid, homogeneous tumor ablation with the ability to overcome the limitations of current tumor interventions. Many cancer patients are not eligible for surgery. Existing minimally invasive and non-invasive tumor interventions have significant limitations that prevent them from being effective at treating tumors near major vessels, large tumors (>3 cm diameter), or tumors with multiple (>3) nodules. Histotripsy is a non-invasive ultrasound ablation technique that produces cavitation to disrupt the target tissue with millimeter precision. Our previous in vivo studies in normal tissues and tumor models have shown 1) homogenous, complete cellular disruption in targeted areas without damaging the overlying tissue, 2) ability to treat tissue adjacent to large vessels, 3) ability to treat ~5 cm diameter tumors within one hour, 4) real-time treatment monitoring with ultrasound imaging, and 5) potential of complete tumor ablation without residual tumor, recurrence, or new metastasis. Further, our recent results show that histotripsy combined with electrical focal steering completely fractionated ~32 mL (~4cm diameter) ex vivo bovine liver within 10 min, more than twice the rate than any current non-surgical intervention method. These results suggest that histotripsy has the potential to significantly improve upon existing tumor intervention methods. For this proposal, the specific aims focus on technical advancements to allow histotripsy to overcome the limitations of current tumor intervention methods with liver cancer as the first target clinical application. The four aims are: 1) develop an electronic focal steering strategy and parameters to achieve rapid (>5mL/min), homogenous ablation of large (>3cm) and multiple (>3) volumes safely through overlying tissue; 2) develop a motion tracking method to achieve rapid and accurate treatment in the presence of breathing motion; 3) design and construct an integrated ultrasound image-guided histotripsy ablation system for human liver cancer patients; and 4) test the in vivo safety and efficacy of the techniques and device from Aims 1-3 for complete liver tumor ablation in a large animal (porcine) liver model and a woodchuck liver tumor model. The proposed technical improvements and the integrated liver ablation system, all validated in vivo, will be essential to advance histotripsy towards future clinical translation to treat liver tumors and could be extended to many other tumor types, including tumors in the kidney, prostate, pancreas, and uterus."
"9619680","ABSTRACT  Thetis plans to investigate TP-317, an innovative and potential first in-class therapeutic agent, as an oral therapy for the induction and maintenance of remission of intestinal inflammation symptoms in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. While the precise etiology of UC is unknown, it is thought to result from an inappropriate inflammatory response to commensal gut bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals. Current treatment regimens for treatment of UC can be: 1) excessively broad in scope, inducing a pan-suppression of host immunity and a predisposition to infection and malignancy, and 2) not uniformly effective or durable, as evidenced by the high percentage of complications of the disease. Novel oral agents that are safe and effective for the induction and maintenance of UC remission would represent a major improvement in treatment options.  TP-317 is a unique derivative of Resolvin E1 (RvE1), a metabolite of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). RvE1 is part of the resolvin family of specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), a group of enzymatically hydroxylated metabolites derived from EPA. SPMs, including RvE1, are particularly important for maintaining immunological homeostasis in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which is constantly exposed to bacterial antigens and other inflammatory stimuli. By delivering RvE1 to the intestinal mucosa, TP- 317 has prospects to promote the resolution of inflammation, accelerate intestinal tissue repair and minimize exposure to potentially harmful inflammation without sacrificing host-protective functions of the innate immune system. RvE1 has been shown in several well-designed studies to be effective in treating UC in animal models. Through innovative medicinal chemistry, Thetis has developed proprietary technology to convert bioactive lipids into solid, stable, small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Using this technology, Thetis chemically transforms RvE1 into TP-317, an innovative NME with pharmaceutical and IP credentials that represents a novel approach to immunoresolution-based therapeutics for UC. TP-317 offers several key advantages including (1) rapid dissociation in aqueous solution to deliver RvE1 as the natural material that is an endogenous mediator regulating inflammatory processes; (2) an anticipated favorable safety profile with prospects for minimal off-target effects; and (3) favorable physico-chemical properties that make TP-317 amenable to formulation as a tablet or capsule for oral administration.  Phase 1 of this SBIR Fast Track will demonstrate the efficacy of oral TP-317 for the treatment of UC (Specific Aim #1) and characterize the pharmacokinetics of oral TP-317 (Specific Aim #2). Phase 2 of this project will include initial characterization of TP-317 safety and toleration (Specific Aim #3), synthesis and qualification of TP-317 for use in GLP studies (Specific Aim # 4), and conduct of full GLP toxicology and safety pharmacology studies (Specific Aim #5). On completion of this Fast-track SBIR project, Thetis will be in a position to complete CMC activities and subsequently prepare and submit an IND filing to initiate Phase I clinical studies."
"9414685","Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Given the limited regenerative capacity of the human heart following myocardial injury, stem cell-based therapies, including the recent cKit+ cell therapy have emerged as a promising approach for improving cardiac repair and function. Clinical and preclinical data suggests that benefits of cKit+ cell transplantation include improved cardiac function and myocardial mass. However, the ability of cKit+ CPCs to differentiate into cardiomyocytes as a significant mode of cardiac repair is controversial. Published data from our group has established the beneficial effects of stem cell factor (SCF), the ligand for cKit, in improving the abundance of cKit+ cells, angiogenesis and cardiac function in both rat and pig models of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Further, our preliminary data suggest that secreted paracrine factors, particularly the membrane-bound exosomes, may mediate most of the pro-angiogenic paracrine activity of the SCF-treated cKit+ cell. Our central hypothesis is that mobilization of a heterogeneous group of endogenous CPCs using gene transfer for the receptor tyrosine cKit ligand stem cell factor (SCF) can enhance cardiac tissue repair following myocardial injury via their paracrine secretion. We will test the necessary and sufficient conditions of SCF-induced CPC recruitment using the MI model of heart failure in swine to evaluate the roles of SCF-induced cKit, PW1 and PDGFR? expressing CPCs in myocardial repair, regeneration and restoration of function. We will test the hypothesis that cKit, PW1 and PDGFR? progenitor cells are sufficient for SCF induced cardiac repair by gain of function experiments using SCF modRNA. We will test the hypothesis that cKit, PW1 and PDGFR? progenitor cells are necessary for cardiac repair by loss of function experiments using shRNA-mediated knockdown of cKit, PDGFR? and PW1 receptors. RNAs will be delivered one-week post-MI by the clinically relevant intracoronary route and animals will be evaluated for survival, cardiac remodeling, cardiac function, cell-specific proliferation and differentiation and the molecular mechanisms involved. We will determine the role of paracrine secretion from cKit+ CPCs in SCF-induced cardiac repair. Our preliminary data suggest that exosomes, and not the exosomes-depleted fraction from swine post-MI cKit- secretome have pro-angiogenic activity. Using specific expertise for exosomes research, we will identify the miRNA expression of cKit+ exosomes in response to SCF. In addition, we will investigate the functional mechanisms of cKit+ exosomes-induced proliferation and contractile function of cardiomyocytes and angiogenesis of endothelial cells in vitro. Finally, we will determine the therapeutic benefits of cKit exosomes in a swine model of heart failure."
"9402060","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been validated as a cornerstone of therapy for multiple myeloma by pre-clinical and clinical studies from our group and others. However, response rates among patients in the relapsed and refractory setting for bortezomib and carfilzomib, the two proteasome inhibitors that have garnered regulatory approvals, are less than 50% and 25%, respectively, and both are associated with significant toxicities. Moreover, patients are currently treated empirically, since no markers of proteasome inhibitor sensitivity have been identified, and even patients who initially respond eventually develop resistant disease through poorly understood mechanisms. Our preliminary studies have identified tight junction protein (TJP) 1 as a key modulator of proteasome inhibitor sensitivity through its ability to influence the balance in plasma cells between the proteasome load and capacity, a key determinant of myeloma responsiveness to proteasome inhibition. Furthermore, manipulation of TJP1 activity and expression is able to achieve chemosensitization and overcome chemoresistance to proteasome inhibitors. Together, these findings support our central hypothesis, which proposes that TJP1 is both a candidate biomarker of proteasome capacity and proteasome inhibitor sensitivity in myeloma, and a target for novel approaches to enhance the efficacy of this class of agents. To evaluate these possibilities, additional studies are proposed to further delineate the mechanisms by which TJP1 exerts its effects on proteasome subunit synthesis, and therefore capacity. In addition, genomic studies will be performed in association with prospective cooperative group trials of bortezomib and carfilzomib to validate the possibility that TJP1 expression may help to identify patients who are most and least likely to benefit from proteasome inhibitor-based therapy. Finally, approaches to enhance the activity of TJP1, including inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor and Janus kinases/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and also approaches to enhance TJP1 expression, such as with hypomethylating agents, will be evaluated for their ability to induce chemosensitization, and overcome chemoresistance in cell lines, primary samples, and physiologically relevant in vivo murine models."
"9403220","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of improved biological vascular graft materials is a significant medical need that has under development since the 1980's. We have developed a tissue-engineered, cellular vascular graft that is currently being evaluated in two, Phase I/II clinical trials. Human vascular smooth muscle cells are seeded onto a degradable polymer in a bioreactor, and cultured to produce an engineered vascular smooth muscle-based artery. After quantitative decellularization, an arterial graft is produced which lacks cellular antigens, is composed primarily of collagens, and which retains the mechanical properties of the original, cellular graft. Using this technology, human, engineered grafts have been implanted as arteriovenous (AV) grafts into a total of 60 hemodialysis patients. Interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials has shown primary patency at 6 and 12 months is 64% and 30%, while secondary patency at 6 and 12 months is 97% and 89%, respectively. Secondary patencies of 97% and 89% are substantially better than historical values for PTFE grafts, implying that the acellular grafts are resistant both to infection and to intimal hyperplasia. However, acellular grafts are subject to thrombosis and require thrombectomy interventions, and their primary patency is similar to that reported for PTFE. These results imply that exposed collagen on the graft lumen triggers platelet activation, leading to episodes of acute thrombosis. Collagen-triggered platelet activation may also hamper graft function if they are used for small-diameter (< 6mm) peripheral or coronary artery bypass. To address this issue of exposed collagen and platelet activation, we have developed a novel and innovative covalent surface modification using cross-linked hyaluronan (HA). The HA coating shields platelets from the collagenous graft surface in vitro, and our pilot data show decreased thrombosis in vivo. We hypothesize that coating of acellular, engineered grafts with cross-linked HA will shield collagen from platelets, decrease thrombosis, and allow endothelial repopulation of the graft lumen. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a rational set of in vitro and in vivo studies, using a porcie model of arteriovenous grafting to establish biological efficacy.  The impact of this coating could be to improve the function of arteriovenous and small- caliber vascular grafting materials, as well as other types of blood-contacting surfaces, in the future. The expertise that we have brought to bear on this project includes a leader in vascular tissue engineering (Niklason), a surgeon who is an expert in vascular graft remodeling (Dardik), and a leader in biomaterials who has pioneered the development of functionalized HA molecules (Prestwich, consultant)."
"9453542","ABSTRACT Plasmodium vivax causes approximately 100 million cases of clinical malaria each year and many more cases of asymptomatic parasitemia. Although not as virulent as P. falciparum, P. vivax nonetheless causes chronic anemia during infancy and life-threatening morbidities, including severe anemia, respiratory distress, renal failure and splenic rupture. After release from hepatocytes, merozoites only infect reticulocytes that in culture rapidly mature to erythrocytes, which limits in vitro culture and laboratory research. Unfortunately current vaccine candidates do not induce strong immunity in non-human primates. New insights are needed to develop an effective vaccine against P. vivax malaria. Previously immunological control of blood stage infection was thought to depend primarily on antibodies rather than on T cells, because mature red blood cells do not express HLA class I. Because reticulocytes, unlike mature erythrocytes, retain RNA and a high capacity for protein expression, we hypothesized that infected reticulocytes might act as antigen-presenting cells and targets for CD8+ T lymphocytes during malaria. Indeed, our preliminary studies, using samples from an endemic area of Amazonia, indicate a high frequency of HLA class I+ reticulocytes circulating in P. vivax-infected patients and a high proportion of activated circulating CD8+ T cells, which, when co-cultured with infected reticulocytes, form an immune synapse, secrete IFN?, release their cytotoxic granules and kill. Thus we hypothesize that CD8+ T cells recognize infected reticulocytes and that CD8 T cell immunity is an unappreciated, but important, component of P. vivax immunity. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will investigate whether infected reticulocytes present parasite antigens bound to HLA class I that are recognized by P. vivax-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes from malaria patients. In Aim 2 we will determine whether P. vivax-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes recognize and lyse infected reticulocytes by cytotoxic granule exocytosis and also kill intracellular parasites in a granulysin-dependent manner. The aim of these experiments is to confirm the preliminary data and begin to define how infected reticulocytes are recognized and destroyed by cytotoxic killer T cells. These data should open a new perspective for development of P. vivax malaria vaccines.      "
"9386089","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are common, familial vascular malformations that arise due to mutations in three genes, KRIT1, CCM2 and PDCD10. Adaptor proteins encoded by the CCM genes bind each other and the cell surface receptor, Heart of Glass (HEG). Genetic studies in mice have revealed that HEG-CCM signaling is required in endothelial cells for early vascular development, while dilated hearts in deficient fish have also suggested that CCM signaling guides heart development and growth. How CCM signaling alters endothelial cell function in the setting of cardiovascular development and CCM disease remains unclear. We have used a new Nfatc1Cre allele to delete CCM signaling exclusively in the endocardium of the heart, thereby bypassing the requirement for this pathway in early vessel growth. We find that endocardial loss of CCM signaling results in heart failure associated with loss of cardiac jelly and over-expression of the ADAMTS5 protease and the KLF2 transcription factor. Reduced expression of either gene rescues the heart defects in ccm-deficient fish, demonstrating causal, functional roles for these new downstream CCM signaling effectors. The present proposal will define this new pathway downstream of CCM signaling by (i) testing CCM regulation of cardiac and vascular matrix, (ii) defining the role of CCM regulation of KLF2 in cardiac development and vascular disease models, and (iii) testing the hypothesis that CCM signaling affects matrix and KLF2 and ADAMTS5 gene expression through regulation of MEKK3 activity and MAPK signaling. These studies are expected to yield new insight into how the endocardium regulates cardiac development, and how CCM signaling affects endothelial cell function in the context of cardiovascular development and vascular disease."
"9437094","Mobility impairment and disability are common in people with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are major contributors to morbidity and mortality. An improved understanding of contributing factors is needed to guide effective interventions. Skeletal muscle fibrosis has received little attention despite being ubiquitously present in animal models of muscle atrophy including CKD. Proper maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) requires coordinated interactions of several cell types, including satellite cells (muscle stem-like cells) and several fibrogenic precursor cell types. These cells are highly sensitive to the extracellular milieu, and in uremic animals muscle fibrosis occurs due to impaired satellite cell function. As excess ECM deposition and fibrosis reduce muscle specific force, and as fibrosis is often accompanied by myofiber atrophy and capillary rarefaction, muscle fibrosis may be an important contributor to mobility impairment in CKD. The focus of this application is the characterization of skeletal muscle fibrosis in an ongoing study of patients with advanced CKD and the development of non- invasive imaging methods to quantify fibrotic burden that can be widely applied to populations at risk. We will (1) determine whether skeletal muscle fibrosis is increased in humans with CKD and characterize satellite cell and fibrogenic precursor cell abundance and TGF-? signaling in quadriceps muscle biopsies; (2) determine if MRI-based measures of muscle fibrosis are increased in humans with CKD and represent a novel non-invasive means of quantifying fibrotic burden; and (3) explore the association of skeletal muscle fibrosis with muscle strength and physical function in patients with CKD. Thus, these studies will provide new insights into human skeletal muscle pathology and will facilitate its further study with novel non-invasive means of assessment."
"9436111","PROJECT SUMMARY The marked increase in the frequency and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial (GNB) infections has created an urgent need for alternative therapeutic approaches. Given that the mechanisms to evade antibiotics is evolving more rapidly than the development of new antibiotics, novel approaches in a ?post-antibiotic? era are needed. Immunotherapeutic approaches, such as vaccines, are less prone to the emergence of resistant organisms and avoid the possibility of immune compromise that complicate strategies that target the host response. Vaccine-induced antibodies against bacteria, including those directed against the conserved LPS core (lipooligosaccharide, LOS) region of GNB are highly effective and protective against a broad range of clinically relevant GNB in both animal models of infection and in human studies. Previously, we developed a subunit LOS-based vaccine, an innovative formulation of the earlier heat-killed E. coli O111, J5- mutant vaccine. The purified LOS required chemical detoxification to reduce reactogenicity, and non-covalent complexing with group B N. meningitides (Nm) outer membrane protein (OMP) to improve immunogenicity. The resulting J5dLOS/OMP vaccine was well-tolerated in two Phase 1 clinical trials and highly immunogenic when administered with CPG 7909 adjuvant. We now propose the development of a next generation J5 LOS vaccine that will be genetically detoxified and have intrinsic TLR4-adjuvant activity while retaining the conserved core LOS epitope. Through the use of bacterial enzymatic combinatorial chemistry (BECC), the Ernst laboratory has pioneered the production of lipid A mimetics with reduced endotoxicity but which retain monophosphoryl lipid A-like adjuvant activity. In Specific Aim 1, we will generate a series of rationally- designed targeted modifications in the lipid A portion of E. coli J5 mutant, prepare LOS from each modified isolate, characterize the structure and assess their endotoxicity in HEKT293-Blue cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will compare the immunogenicity of the genetically-detoxified LOSs to that of the chemically-detoxified J5 LOS with and without complexing to recombinant OMP. We will select those LOSs that are most immunogenic and with reduced endotoxicity for evaluation of protective activity in murine models of lethal peritonitis and pneumonia caused by an MDR strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. At the conclusion of these studies, we will evaluate if a genetically-detoxified, intrinsically-adjuvanted J5 LOS vaccine is equivalent or superior to the current J5dLPS/OMP vaccine already shown to induce a robust antibody response in healthy human subjects. A successful vaccine could be used to generate antibodies for the treatment of a broad range of MDR GNB infections, a huge, unmet medical need, either alone or in synergistic combination with antibiotics, or for the prevention of infection in patients at high risk of severe GNB infections."
"9600551","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Post-partum weight retention contributes to obesity for many women, increasing risk for cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases and complicating future pregnancies. Lifestyle interventions have shown to be modestly efficacious for post-partum weight loss in randomized controlled trials, yet interventions with numerous visits are logistically challenging for many post-partum women. Innovative and efficacious treatment models for post-partum weight loss that fit into the busy lives of new moms are needed, and cost-effectiveness is critical for adoption. Facebook may be an efficient platform for delivering evidence-based weight loss programming to post-partum women. Delivering interventions via Facebook allows us to connect with post- partum women where they are, more fully integrating into their lives and daily routines. We have developed a post-partum weight loss intervention based on the Diabetes Prevention Program, tailored to needs of post- partum women and for delivery via Facebook. The goal of the proposed project is to gather critical preliminary data to finalize the design of a large randomized trial to compare the non-inferiority and cost-effectiveness of this post-partum weight loss intervention delivered via Facebook versus in-person group sessions. We will conduct a pilot randomized trial with 72 overweight or obese post-partum women comparing delivery of a post- partum weight loss intervention via Facebook to in-person group sessions. We will examine the feasibility of recruitment (especially the proportion of women unwilling to be randomized to one condition), sustained participation, contamination, retention, and feasibility of assessment procedures, particularly measurement of cost-related data, in both treatment conditions. We will describe weight loss as an exploratory outcome. Second, in pre-pilot and post-intervention focus groups, we will solicit women's feedback on posts with low engagement, and will iteratively refine these posts to make them more engaging. Finally, we will compare self- reported time spent on Facebook to participate in the intervention with application-tracked time on Facebook, changes in use, and time spent visibly engaging, to develop procedures for measuring time spent on Facebook to participate in the intervention that balance accuracy and participant burden. The proposed project will provide preliminary data needed to finalize the design of a subsequent large non-inferiority trial. Demonstrating cost-effectiveness in addition to efficacy of our Facebook-delivered post-partum weight loss intervention is critical to support widespread implementation."

The Program goals are addressed with three themes that encompass basic, preclinical, and clinical research. The first theme identifies and exploits the mechanisms that confer phenotypical plasticity and survival of tumor cells in tumor progression. Translational research is conducted to evaluate the potential clinical application of these molecular determinants as tumor markers and/or therapeutic targets. The second theme identifies and exploits the mechanisms that confer the unhealable wounding of tumor stroma. Our investigators identify and characterize factors in an extracellular proteolysis and signaling network that enable tumor cells to adapt to and subvert the microenvironment in the development of bone metastases. Key molecules in this network are evaluated to determine if they can be used to predict cancer progression and treatment outcomes. The third theme identifies and exploits the host immune response to tumor progression. Bispecific antibody-armed activated T-cells are tested in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies in the context of chemotherapy or high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Anti-tumor DNA vaccines are developed and tested using mouse and domesticated cat models. Our investigators study immune modulators and inhibitors of adverse pro-inflammatory responses. Our members also develop novel vehicles to deliver immunotherapeutic agents. TBM Program members actively collaborate with members of the MI, MT, and PSDR Programs at KCI. Of the 612 manuscripts published from December 2010 to November 2014, 44% and 38% were intra- and inter-programmatic, respectively, and 27% were multi-institutional collaborations."
"9617932","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black males exhibit a steeper escalation in substance use (i.e., cross-over effects) and experience disproportionately higher rates of correlated poor health outcomes (e.g., HIV-related deaths and homicide) and low educational attainment compared with White males during emerging adulthood (ages 18 to 29 years). 1-3 Neighborhoods have been identified as important contexts for investigating substance use during emerging adulthood. 4 Yet, there is a fundamental gap in the current scientific evidence-base about the role of neighborhood conditions, beyond those defined by census data, in shaping substance use for Black emerging adult males. An equally notable evidence gap is created by the limited number of studies focusing on mechanisms that could explain why some Black emerging adult males exposed to less optimal neighborhood conditions engage in problematic (vs. non-problematic) substance use (i.e., alcohol and marijuana). This K01 application, entitled Neighborhoods, daily stress, affect regulation, & Black male substance use proposes integrated training and research to address these gaps by assessing potential pathways linking directly-observed neighborhood violence, alcohol, and drug activity to problematic substance use among Black male emerging adults. The potential pathways include theory-supported stress- affective mechanisms: daily stress, stress and androgenic hormones (as assessed through biomarkers), and affect regulation. The central hypothesis, grounded in Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory5, and psychobiological models of stress, coping, and risk-taking,6-8 is that neighborhoods with high violence, alcohol, and drug activity instigate problematic substance use through increased daily stress experiences leading in turn to higher negative affect, and dysregulated cortisol and testosterone. Moreover, when these stress response processes occur in tandem with affect regulation strategies that encourage 'stuffing down' negative affect (i.e., emotion suppression), the effect on problematic substance use is expected to be heightened. The studies will employ a sample of non-substance dependent, Black emerging adult males (n = 66) drawn from Durham, NC neighborhoods (i.e., census block groups). A variety of assessment and analytic methods will be used including neighborhood social observations, Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA), salivary hormone biomarker analyses, and focus groups. Three specific aims will be examined in two complementary studies: 1) to use the Neighborhood Inventory for Environmental Typology (NIfETy) 9, and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data to examine associations between neighborhood violence, alcohol, and drug activity (VAOD) and daily problematic alcohol and marijuana use; 2) to investigate daily stress-affective mechanisms linking neighborhood VAOD to daily problematic alcohol and marijuana use; and 3) to develop tailored messages for a future ecological momentary intervention designed to modulate stress-affective processes in real-time. Dr. Powell Hammond, who is trained in clinical psychology and health behavior and health education, and has focused her research career on using community-based approaches to investigate stress, gender, and health disparities, particularly among Black males. Training activities will include: formal didactics and hands-on instruction in conducting systemic social observations of neighborhoods, EMA, and salivary bioscience methods, workshops on tailored message development and ecological momentary intervention design, bioethics and responsible conduct in research training, and attendance at national and international conferences. She has assembled a strong interdisciplinary mentoring team that will guide her training and career development plans for building new skills in substance abuse research, neighborhood epidemiological assessment and social observational methods, ecological momentary assessment/intervention design, salivary biomarker measurement and data collection, and statistical methods for analyzing complex longitudinal models. The K01 award will increase her capabilities as an independent researcher to develop and test a fully powered ecological momentary intervention, as a separate R-level proposal. Results of the proposed research will also enhance current understanding of neighborhood effects on problematic substance use in Black males, inform development of ecologically valid addiction and relapse prevention interventions, and ultimately help to reduce substance use cross-over effects and substance abuse-related morbidity and mortality among Black emerging males."
"9443548","Abstract Hypoglycemia (low blood glucose concentration) is common, and the only readily preventable cause of brain damage in newborn babies. Approximately 1.2 million babies a year in the US are born at risk of hypoglycemia and require regular blood tests to detect this problem. If hypoglycemia does occur, it is usually treated with additional feeding, and if necessary admission to a newborn intensive care unit (NICU) for intravenous glucose. Admission to NICU separates mothers and babies, interfering with the establishment of breast- feeding, and is expensive. Dextrose gel, rubbed inside the baby's cheek, is a simple, safe, inexpensive and effective treatment to reverse neonatal hypoglycemia. A randomized trial of 2,129 babies is currently under way to determine whether dextrose gel can be used to prevent hypoglycemia. Babies at risk of neonatal hypoglycemia are randomized to dextrose or placebo gel prophylaxis. The primary outcome is admission to NICU. If gel is effective in preventing hypoglycemia and admission to NICU, it may also prevent brain damage and enhance breast-feeding. However, it is important to determine whether these effects, if they do eventuate, have any beneficial effects on later developmental, health and growth outcomes. It is also important to be sure that using gel for prevention is safe, in view of observational data that a rapid rise in blood glucose after birth may be associated with poorer developmental outcomes. This application is to follow up babies from the trial to determine if there are any benefits or adverse effects at two years' corrected age. Assessments will include standardized measures of neurological status, developmental status, executive function, vision and visual processing, physical size, general health, and family environment. Approximately 30% of babies are born at risk of hypoglycemia and hence may be eligible for dextrose gel prophylaxis if it proves effective. This follow-up study will provide crucial evidence of longer term efficacy and safety that will be essential before introduction into clinical practice."
"9382866","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian olfactory system achieves remarkable sensitivity through novel genetic mechanisms, cellular specializations, and subsequent processing of sensory information by neuronal circuitry. The earliest steps in the transduction of odorant information into signals that are propagated to the brain occur in olfactory cilia. The dozen long immotile cilia of each olfactory neuron are the only part of the sensory cell exposed to the outside environment and the sources of odorant stimuli and their existence is essential for efficient odor detection. The olfactory neuron has developed efficient but poorly understood mechanisms for enriching the components of olfactory transduction (odorant receptor (OR), G protein (Golf), adenylyl cyclase (AC3) and olfactory cyclic nucleotide channel) in cilia. The abundant expression of the single polypeptide comprising the AC3 enzyme in all olfactory neurons makes it particularly amenable to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms responsible for cilia localization and enrichment. In this grant we will use molecular and genetic approaches to investigate the hypothesis that a specialized but broadly utilized mechanism and pathway is responsible for AC3 localization to cilia and that this localization is critical for cilia dynamics and function. In specific aim 1, we target the cilia localization signa of AC3 in vivo by a conditional genetic disruption approach and determine the consequences of re- localization of AC3 into different cellular compartments. In specific aim 2, we will utilize a robut expression system to identify components of the AC3 translocation/enrichment pathway leading to cilia localization and examine the dynamics of AC3 in cilia and role of AC3 localization in modulation of cilia length. Together, these experiments will expand our understanding of how an important class of proteins are enriched in cilia and the importance of their selective localizatio to this organelle. Cilia are present in essentially all terminally differentiated mammalian cells ad critical for the development of the organism. The pathways and mechanisms underlying adenylyl cyclase localization will have important consequences for olfaction, sensory communication and broadly for human health and understanding disease. The abundance of AC3 in olfactory neurons makes it particularly amenable for detailed studies. The AC3 enzyme is broadly expressed and highly enriched in many neuronal cilia of the brain and kidney where it likely mediates neuroendocrine/neurotransmitter signaling and its subcellular localization in these cells appear to be mediated by similar mechanisms. Modulation of this pathway should perturb complex behaviors and metabolic processes. Additionally, it is likely that the cilia localization pathway utilized by AC3 is shared by other proteins whose presence in cilia is critical for cellular function. Elucidation of these pathways will provide insight into cellular processes that have widespread consequences for human health."
"9453421","SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery."
"9404015","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 5 - 10% of breast cancer patients have hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) and face future risks for second primary breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer that are multiple times those of most breast cancer patients. Effective strategies exist for prevention and/or early detection of future cancers among these high-risk patients.  Despite all this potential for the application of genomic information to improve long-term health and quality of life, unfortunately, little is known regardig the real world decisions and outcomes of breast cancer patients at risk for HBOC because essentially all of the research to date has been conducted at academic medical centers where healthcare services and, quite likely, health and quality of life outcomes are very different from those in the community setting where the vast majority of high-risk patients are currently identified and receive care.  We have developed and will leverage a multidisciplinary academic-industry partnership with the nation's third-largest health insurer, Aetna and extensive interconnecting research infrastructure to conduct the first national prospective study of these critical issues. We will recruit 5000 consecutive newly diagnosed breast cancer patients undergoing BRCA testing through Aetna. We will assess participants within two weeks after receiving genetic test results (baseline) and at 12 and 24 months post-notification to accomplish our specific aims to: 1. Assess the treatment and cancer risk management decisions and outcomes of BRCA testing among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients at increased risk for HBOC. 2. Compare the choice of initial surgical treatment, cancer risk management decisions and outcomes of BRCA testing of patients who receive genetic testing results prior to surgery compared with after surgery. 3. Identify demographic, medical/family history and psychosocial factors associated with the utilization of available risk management options. 4. Assess health and quality of life outcomes associated with different genetic tests results, timing of results delivery and treatment and risk management decisions.  Success in this endeavor will produce the first representative national data regarding the real world decisions and outcomes of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients undergoing genetic testing due to increased risk for HBOC and can lead to improved health policies and targeted clinical strategies to improve care for breast cancer survivors at the highest levels of future cancer risk."
"9406513","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated."
"9430421","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), an obstruction of blood flow in the arteries in the extremity, most commonly involves the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and affects approximately eight million Americans [1]. For patients with PAD, endovascular stenting can be a promising therapy that alleviates plaque obstruction and restores blood flow. However, stent fracture is a serious problem and it can lead to vascular complications such as restenosis, stent occlusion, and re-interventional procedures. Stent fracture is influenced by type of stent and local mechanical forces that are influenced by arterial wall composition including degree of calcification. Selection of stents for patients should take into account vascular complexities such as realistic in vivo arterial compliances and disease severity.  The long term goal of this study is to establish through experimentation, modeling, and simulation analysis of stent fatigue in the diseased state. Previous studies have modeled arteries as homogenous conduits, and do not consider individual patient environments. There are no existing models for the prediction of stent fatigue that combine biomedical imaging data of the diseased superficial femoral artery, which is essential for realistic in vivo arterial compliances. In this study, an automated artery computer model based on ultrasound virtual histology will incorporate the histological disease condition of the arteries. Combined with stent modeling, this computer model is targeted to be streamlined for the clinical arena and used as a physician tool for virtual evaluation and stent selection in a patient arterial setting.  This reserch proposes to generate a computer model tool to aid in stent selection of for patients with peripheral artery disease and validate it. It will involve expanding our current stent artery computer model to include plaques of varying compositions. The study encompasses development of a large patient artery model database, development of a large stent model database for commercially available stents, and integration of the stent and artery models to evaluate varying plaque compositions and their impact on stent fatigue. Each modeling step will be validated with a unique experimental setup under application of in vivo pressures. This work will lead to knowledge about arterial stiffness, stent-artery interfaces, boundary conditions, cardiac pressure interactions, restenosis, and stent fracture. Future work will be to implement the computer modeling tool clinically."
"9407045","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Career Development Award (K01) is to enable Dr. Becky Marquez to become an independent investigator focused on developing interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors by targeting social support networks to promote eating and exercise behaviors conducive to weight management for Latinas. Given the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular disease, it is imperative that intervention studies address weight management among Mexican-American women, a group disproportionately affected by obesity. A dyad-level intervention partnering mothers and their adult daughters may be a culturally salient and effective approach to improve diet and physical activity. Because communication among family members can impact health behaviors, promoting communication that facilitates healthy eating and physical activity could help build an interpersonal environment that supports weight management among mothers and daughters. An intervention that addresses communication competency is especially warranted for Latino families as dissonance in acculturation between parent and child can interfere with effective communication and increase conflict. The purpose of the proposed study is to develop, implement, and evaluate a behavioral weight management intervention with a communication training component for Mexican-American women. The study has three specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a behavioral weight loss intervention that modifies evidence-based behavioral weight loss treatment using results from formative data collected from Mexican-American mother-daughter dyads. The adapted intervention will focus on improving dyadic communication and collaboration for providing reciprocal support for healthy eating and physical activity behaviors. Aim 2: Implement and evaluate a pilot weight management program adapted for mother-daughter dyads. Dyads will be randomly assigned to partner-based treatment with or without communication skills training. We hypothesize that participants receiving partner-based treatment with communication skills training will have better treatment adherence, study retention, and weight loss compared to those receiving partner-based treatment alone. Aim 3: Evaluate associations between changes in weight, weight-related behaviors, and psychosocial variables with changes in measures assessing interpersonal communication. We expect weight loss and improvements in diet, physical activity and psychosocial variables, such as social support, to be significantly associated with improvements in communication. The training plan, through didactic education and direct mentorship, will allow Dr. Marquez to develop skills and experience in: 1) the conduct and analysis of randomized clinical trials (with an emphasis on partner-based interventions), 2) the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of obesity, 3) interpersonal communication skills training, and 4) writing and communication of scientific work. The environment at UC San Diego and expert team of mentors will enable Dr. Marquez to achieve her training and research goals. (End of Abstract)"
"9424414","PROJECT SUMMARY Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of positive-sense RNA viruses that cause human illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe and lethal respiratory disease. Since 2002, two CoVs (SARS- and MERS-CoV) have emerged as zoonoses with pandemic potential, and SARS-like CoVs continue to circulate in bats. Lack of proofreading activity greatly increases the genetic diversity of most families of positive-strand RNA viruses and is thought to limit genome size, facilitate adaptability and virulence, and alter host range. Coronaviruses, whose genomes are several times larger than other positive-strand RNA viruses, encode a unique proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is distinct from the nsp12- RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp). We have demonstrated that inactivation of ExoN [ExoN(-)] results in a mutator phenotype characterized by increased mutation frequency, increased sensitivity to RNA mutagens, decreased replication, decreased fitness, and stable attenuation in vivo. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how nsp14-ExoN and nsp12-RdRp facilitate replication, fidelity, and overall fitness of coronaviruses. We have generated a murine hepatitis virus lacking ExoN [MHV-ExoN(-)] and passaged the virus 250 times (P250), resulting in a mutant MHV with compensated replication and restored resistance to mutagens. MHV-ExoN(-)-P250 retains the engineered ExoN(-) mutations and encodes additional mutations in nsp14 and nsp12-RdRp. In Specific Aim 1, we will define determinants within nsp12-RdRp and nsp14-ExoN that compensate for ExoN-associated defects in replication, RNA synthesis, and replication fidelity using WT- MHV, MHV-ExoN(-), MHV-ExoN(-)-P250, as well as engineered MHV that exchanges specific P250 proteins in the isogenic MHV-ExoN(-) background. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how ExoN proofreading affects the genetic diversity and overall fitness of coronavirus populations. We will use highly accurate deep sequencing to examine the types and abundance of mutations in our altered-fidelity viruses. We will also quantitatively measure replication in hundreds of single-cell infections to determine how genetic diversity impacts the success and extent of individual infection events. Together, these studies will define determinants within the RdRp and nsp14-ExoN that cooperate to regulate RNA synthesis and replication fidelity. Further, these results will define the role of ExoN in regulating CoV genetic diversity and elucidate how genetic diversity affects virus fitness. Finally, these studies will establish new tools for the incisive study of CoV replication and fitness, and will define new vulnerabilities in CoVs that can be targeted by viral inhibitors or exploited for vaccine development."
"9461324","Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A (ALDOA) is an ancient, highly expressed gene that has acquired three distinct cellular activities. The best understood activity is catalyzing a key step in aerobic glycolysis. ALDOA also has protein binding activities independent of its catalytic activity (?moonlighting?), that include binding to cytoskeletal proteins, which use an ?E?E? motif that fits into a ?moonlighting pocket? of ALDO. Binding to the cytoskeleton actin holds ALDO in an inactive form until it is needed, when it is released by an increase in the levels of its substrate fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate and/or by growth-factor-induced PI-3-kinase activity. Another moonlighting function of ALDOA is its presence in the nucleus of cancer cells, where it is associated with increased proliferation. One possibility is that nuclear ALDOA binds to the E?E motif on EID-1 in the nucleus to inhibit HIF-1's transcriptional co-activator, p300. ALDOA levels are increased in many cancers, particularly pancreatic cancer, where it has been linked to poor patient survival and an increase in metastasis. Pancreatic cancer cell has high levels of anaerobic glycolysis that is further increased by the hypoxia inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 induces ALDOA and other glycolytic enzymes that in turn maintain high HIF-1 activity through an AMPK/p300-dependent feed-forward loop. HIF-1 activity leads to VEGF release and angiogenesis, and the induction of other cancer cell survival mechanisms. Increased glycolysis provides hypoxic cancer cells with an increased supply of energy (ATP) and essential metabolites for biomass synthesis. Elevated ALDOA is also associated with low E-cadherin, a component of cancer cell tight junctions (TJ) necessary for cell-cell interactions, giving a more mesenchymal phenotype and increased tumor metastasis. This most likely is due to binding of ALDOA to the E?E motif of cytoskeleton actin causing its polymerization and disassembly, or other inactivation of the TJ with loss of E-cadherin. All this makes ALDOA an exceptional druggable anti-cancer target. Our X-ray crystallography studies have identified a new role for the C-terminal domain of ALDO in its catalytic activity, as well as a reactive Cys289 residue that allows allosteric regulation of catalytic activity. We have identified a novel lead probe allosteric inhibitor of ALDOA that forms a complex with Cys289 inhibiting glycolysis, HIF-1 activity and the proliferation of cancer cells, and in vivo inhibits glycolysis and tumor growth in a tumor xenograft model. Using this biologically stable allosteric inhibitor as a lead, one of our goals is to make more potent inhibitors that bind to the allosteric site Cys289, as well as high affinity bifunctional inhibitors that simultaneously engage the active site and moonlighting pocket. We will use X-ray crystallography to help us design inhibitors that modulate nuclear regulators of HIF-1 activity; and not least to design direct inhibitors of ALDOA catalytic activity. We will use these compounds as pharmacological probes to inhibit the various activities of ALDOA, and as potential leads for new therapies for the treatment of pancreatic, and other cancers."
"9467700","ABSTRACT Over 640,000 US adults suffer from ESRD, >95% of whom receive hemodialysis (HD) for the rest of their life or until transplantation. Kidney disease and HD significantly impact cognitive function, especially higher-order executive function. Only 13% of HD patients have normal cognition; HD patients experience executive function impairment at a rate 3-fold higher than the general population, leading to hospitalization, disability, and death. Studies of older adults suggest that the only effective interventions for preserving executive function are cognitive training (CT) and/or exercise training (ET). These modalities have not been tested for executive function preservation in HD patients; even younger HD patients suffer substantial executive function impairment and could benefit from these interventions. HD frequency (3 sessions a week) and duration (4-6 hours/session) makes HD patients a ?captive audience? for intradialytic CT and/or ET to mitigate executive function decline. In preliminary studies, HD patients reported spending most of their time watching TV; intradialytic CT and/or ET could replace these passive activities. In preliminary studies, 87% of nephrology providers believed that their patients would be interested in intradialytic CT and 83% believed that their patients would be interested in intradialytic ET. Among HD patients, 67% wanted to improve their cognition through CT and 71% wanted to improve their strength and cognition through ET while undergoing HD. To test the feasibility of intradialytic interventions, we conducted a pilot RCT of 20 HD patients, comparing standard of care to CT or ET; even in this pilot, we found that intradialytic CT and ET preserved executive function. As expected, executive function in patients receiving standard of care declined substantially by 3 months (difference=47.4 seconds, P=0.006); however, this decline was not seen among those receiving CT or ET. Compared with standard of care, the difference in mean change was -46.72 seconds (95% CI: -91.12, - 2.31; P=0.04) for CT and -56.21 seconds (95% CI: -105.86, -6.56; P=0.03) for ET. In just 3 months, CT and ET preserved executive function compared to a striking decline with standard of care. To properly test the impact of intradialytic CT and/or ET, on the executive function decline associated with HD, we propose the following aims: 1) To conduct an RCT to evaluate executive function decline in the setting of intradialytic CT and/or ET, 2) To quantify the effects of intradialytic CT and/or ET on ESRD-specific clinical outcomes, 3) To quantify the effects of intradialytic CT and/or ET, on patient-centered outcomes. Through this RCT, we will learn the impact of two potential non-pharmacological interventions, cognitive and exercise training, in preserving executive function during HD. If successful, this will improve HD outcomes of >640,000 adults with ESRD. For the first time, we will have validated, beneficial activities replace the typical passive activities of HD patients. Our findings will be implementable in dialysis centers across the country to help reduce the decline in executive function."
"9390409","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract The ability of Veterans with SCI, MS, ALS, and many other conditions (e.g., multiple amputations, stroke, traumatic brain injury) to live in their homes and communities with maximal independence often hinges, at least in part, on their ability to transfer or be transferred by an assistant. In order to help Veterans with severe disabilities (VSD) live at home and participate in life's activities, the VA may provide for personal attendant care services and in some cases provide stipends for family members providing these services. The primary focus of this grant is study is to engineer solutions to allow VSD who require assistance (human or mechanical) while transferring to be able to transfer in their own homes, in the homes of friends/family, and in the community at large (e.g., hotels, restaurants, shopping malls) in a safe comfortable, efficient, and convenient manner. Clinical experience, focus groups, and the clinical literature strongly support this aim. We believe that an easy to use system for assisting with transfers that is attached to the wheelchair and readily transportable could have a significant impact on the quality of life of VSD. We also hope that this will translate to improvements in participation, particularly in the case of veterans with SCI, MS, or ALS, and other conditions. The Human Engineering Research Laboratories - Robotic Assisted Transfer Device (HERL-RATD) is a new idea that has not been fully investigated. We propose that an electric powered wheelchair mounted robotic transfer device will open new possibilities for community participation, interaction with friends and family, and for school, employment, and travel. Ultimately, we expect that the HERL-RATD will contribute to increased function and quality of life for veterans with severe disabilities (e.g., SCI, MS, ALS, and multi-limb amputations). Our literature review, focus group, and clinical experience have identified several shortcomings with current approaches: - Devices are not easily transportable and are intended only for use in a home or clinical setting. Transfer devices that are transportable (e.g., transfer boards) place considerable strain on the assistant. - Devices facilitate living at home, but do not adequately support community integration (e.g., cannot use the toilet at a local shopping mall or when visiting a hotel, friend or family). - Many living spaces (e.g., bathrooms, bedrooms) become crowded when trying to position a wheelchair, lifting device, and assistant, which greatly constrain the manner in which dependent or assisted transfers can be performed, which affects safety. - There has been little research to understand the biomechanics, ergonomics, and optimal design of portable, user friendly assistive transfer devices. Successful completion of this proposal will lead to the validation of a practical wheelchair mounted mobile robotic-assisted-transfer-device (RATD). The RATD will provide VSD and their caregivers greater autonomy and freedom to participate in the community at large."
"9619824","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious cardiopulmonary disease characterized by progressive narrowing of the small pulmonary arteries and elevated pulmonary artery pressure, which can lead to right heart failure. Much has been learned about the rare familial form by the identification of predisposing genes, but the molecular basis of associated PAH (APAH) in the context of congenital heart defects or connective tissue disorder remains largely unknown. Even in familial PAH, the penetrance of these mutations is low and the additional genetic or environmental factors that contribute to the etiology of PAH are not well understood. Our approach focuses on understanding both the germline genetic variation that predisposes to PAH and also somatic changes arising within the lung that may contribute to the onset and/or progression of the disease. We have shown that in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) isolated from explant lung tissue, one-third of PAH cases harbor large-scale chromosome abnormalities. This is a minimum estimate, since there are likely more subtle alterations that are below the resolution of the analyses we have performed thus far. Levels of DNA damage were markedly higher in PAH cells than controls, not only in PAEC but also in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The level of damage correlated strongly with the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Patients' cells were also significantly more sensitive to DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents than controls. Similar abnormalities were seen across heritable, idiopathic and associated PAH cases. Remarkably, we discovered that PBMC from relatives of patients show the same profile of increased ROS production, mutagen sensitivity and DNA damage, suggesting that it may be a genetically determined trait. Our central hypothesis is that PAH patients share an intrinsic susceptibility to DNA damage that pre-dates the onset of PAH, predisposing to genetic alterations that contribute to vascular remodeling following endothelial cell injury. The aims of this study are to (1) determine the profile of DNA damage and repair in PAH cells, (2) identify the molecular basis of increased ROS and DNA damage, and (3) identify the genetic factors underlying increased DNA damage in PAH."
"9406344","ABSTRACT  End-stage lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are devastating human conditions for which there are no effective treatments. There is increasing evidence that the inability to maintain epithelial integrity or recovery from sustained injury likely reflects a failure of the stem cell compartment to mount an effective regenerative response. Tissue-specific stem cells are crucial for homeostasis and integrity of adult organs. In the airway epithelium these functions have been attributed largely to multipotent p63-dependent basal cells. However, this role is shared by additional progenitors, particularly by a sizable population of uncommitted p63-negative progenitors which occupy a parabasal location interfacing both basal and luminal differentiating cells. Changes in the size or function of the pool of uncommitted airway epithelial progenitors (basal, parabasal cells) are often accompanied by disruption of the microarchitectural organization seen in hyperplasias and metaplasias of end-stage lung conditions  In spite of recent progress, there are still major gaps of knowledge on what collectively the airway endogenous progenitors represent; their origin, diversity, and contribution to plasticity in development, regeneration and disease states. Here we propose to address these gaps of knowledge in our research program to: a) study the molecular and cellular events that control the organization and behavior of the stem cell compartment in the airways, and b) investigate the impact of the disruption of these mechanisms in pulmonary disease pathogenesis. Results from these studies will provide crucial insights currently lacking in the field about how tissue- specific stem cells contribute to normal and disease processes in the lung."
"9405597","In this proposal, the Division of Cardiology at Emory University seeks to become a Regional Clinical Center (RCC) within NHLBI's Heart Failure (HF) Clinical Research Network, a network of centers with active HF programs interested in generating and promoting evidence-based HF practice. Herein, we describe our HF and related programs, collaborators, and related clinical and research programs and institutions, our research and other accomplishments, and our faculty and key personnel; we also provide evidence of our institutional and individual expertise in clinical trials in HF, as well as documentation of access to relevant patient populations including women and minorities, extraordinary volume of HF patients, and  multidisciplinary collaboration in the proposed Emory RCC. We believe that the Emory University infrastructure and investigators are well-equipped to achieve the primary and secondary goals of the Network. If chosen as a RCC, the Emory team will work diligently to achieve the various aims for the Network. We also seek to develop and implement a Clinical Research Skills Development Core to assist new investigators in developing their research skills, thus taking advantage of the rich environment presented by the Network and build upon the core of well trained clinical researchers within cardiovascular medicine focused on HF. As an indication of our ability to conceive, design, and conduct clinical trials, we also propose a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (Nitric Oxide induced Vasodilation Evaluation in acute HF - NOVEL-HF) to evaluate the efficacy of the oral combination of hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate (H-ISDN) in patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction admitted with acute decompensated HF (AHDF). This therapy is associated with hemodynamic benefits that could improve outcomes in ADHF based on observational data. Emory University has a longstanding commitment to diversity and the population mix in the city of Atlanta offers a rich environment to study the similarities and differences in treatment among diverse patient groups. We therefore propose a clinical trial to assess a key clinical question facing HF medicine today, i.e. the role of H- ISDN in ADHF, its benefits and mechanisms of action, and outcomes in black versus non-black HF patients."
"9406346","PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disturbance encountered in clinical practice, affecting approximately 2.3 million people in the United States. AF is an independent risk factor for stroke, congestive heart failure and mortality. Current therapies for AF are inadequate and are associated with limited long term success rates and significant risks. Although many risk factors for AF have been identified, our understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of AF remains elusive. The public health burden of AF, combined with significant gaps in our knowledge of its pathogenesis and the lack of effective treatment, underscore the critical need for new research into its pathogenesis. A recent 2015 NHLBI document outlining strategic research priorities proposed that the identification of novel targets for drug development was a high priority of research to reduce human disease. This proposal sets out to address this priority area by identifying a unifying mechanistic explanation for the pathogenesis of AF, potentially forming the basis for designing novel targeted therapies to prevent or reverse this prevalent human disease. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that autoimmune mechanisms could be implicated in the pathogenesis of AF. Our own preliminary data suggest that autoimmune diseases as a group are more prevalent in patients with AF than non-AF controls. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that AF is an autoimmune-mediated disease. The overall objectives of this application are to determine whether autoimmune diseases are associated with AF development and to identify specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that will improve the ability to accurately predict risk of AF development. In aim 1, we will analyze epidemiologic data from Olmsted County, Minnesota to estimate the prevalence of autoimmune diseases (in aggregate) in patients with incident AF and thereby establish their association with AF. In aim 2, we will prospectively enroll patients with and without AF and determine their serum cytokine levels and assess the functional responses of T cells on the basis of cytokine production after in vitro T-cell specific stimulation, using state-of-the-art Luminex bead-based multiplex technology. The proposed work is significant because a better understanding of the interactions between autoimmune mechanisms and AF is expected to have broad translational value by 1) enhancing our ability to identify individuals at risk of AF and 2) facilitating the development of novel, targeted therapies for the management and prevention of AF. The proposed translational research is innovative because it seeks to identify a novel causative biologic pathway for the development of AF, using a multidisciplinary approach. At the completion of these aims, the role of autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AF will be established and the cytokines profiles of individuals at risk of developing AF will be characterized. Therefore, this proposal will enable better stratification of at-risk patients, and provide a framework for advancement of translational investigations in this field to promote health and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease."
"9545320","Project Summary: Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) represent a major threat to critically ill and immunocompromised patients and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Aspergillus and Candida are opportunistic fungi that cause the majority of these life-threatening infections. In order to exert their deleterious effects, pathogens including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi can hijack tetraspanins for cell invasion or intracellular trafficking. Tetraspanins comprise a family of proteins that are expressed on the plasma membrane, intracellular membranes, and exosomes from nearly all cell types. As their name implies, tetraspanins span the membrane four times and have short intracellular amino and carboxyl-termini and two extracellular loops. Tetraspanins regulate diverse biological processes including cell migration, adhesion, and signaling events by serving as organizers of multimolecular complexes; they form promiscuous associations with one another and other membrane proteins and lipids to generate tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. Elucidating the precise function of tetraspanins has been difficult due to molecular redundancy, a lack of catalytic activity, and insufficient specific antibodies. Despite these challenges, several tetraspanins have been implicated as key regulators of cancer progression and immunity. In particular, CD82 acts as a potent suppressor of tumor metastasis. Tetraspanins including CD82 are also widely expressed in immune cells, but their exact role in undefined. We have made several key observations that begin to define the role of CD82 in fungal immunity. Following phagocytosis by macrophages, CD82 is specifically recruited to phagosomes containing fungal pathogens prior to lysosomal fusion. Remarkably, LysM-Cre CD82 knockout mice infected with Candida albicans have significantly reduced survival compared to wild-type controls, indicating that CD82 plays an important functional role in myeloid cells in response to systemic fungal infection. We developed fungal-like particles to probe directly the immune response to carbohydrates expressed on the fungal cell wall, such as ?- 1,3 glucan which is recognized by the pathogen recognition receptor, Dectin-1. We demonstrated that Dectin-1 is critical for phagolysosomal maturation and controls recruitment of the autophagy-related protein, LC3, to fungal containing phagosomes through Syk activation. We also found that CD82 associates with Dectin-1 in macrophages and is important for downstream signaling events in response to fungal infection including Syk activation and ROS generation. To determine the molecular mechanism of CD82 in fungal innate immunity in macrophages, we propose the following two specific aims: (1) Determine the role of CD82 in Dectin-1 signaling by macrophages stimulated with ?-1,3 glucan, and (2) Define the role of CD82 in LC3 associated phagocytosis in macrophages challenged by C. albicans."
"9457881","Women have a 1 in 8 lifetime risk of breast cancer making it their second highest oncogenic cause of mortality behind lung cancer. Thirty percent of patients with stage I to III disease have silent bone marrow (BM) micro-metastases, which increase their likelihood of cancer recurrence as well as complications, such as pathological fractures, and related to the osteolytic nature of the disease. Even patients with limited early-stage disease, who responded well to chemo- or hormonal therapy at the primary site, may relapse years later when dormant bone marrow micro-metastases, previously protected within the bone marrow niche, recrudesce.  Our research has recently revealed that breast cancer metastasis in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells, in vitro and in vivo, up-regulated ?v?3-integrin expression, leading to marked diminished sensitivity to systemic chemotherapy. Moreover, these data indicated that TGF-?3 sequestered in the bone microstroma was liberated to induce ?v?3-integrin up-regulation. Utilizing this bone BC target, ?v?3-targeted mixed micelles (~15nm) incorporating Sn2 lipase-labile docetaxel (DTX) prodrug (DTX-PD) (?v?3-DTX-PD MP) were developed to rapidly and homogeneously penetrate into the tumor shown and deliver DTX therapy directly into the cell through a novel approach, termed Contact Facilitated Drug Delivery (CFDD). ?v?3-DTX-PD MP markedly reduced bone marrow BC tumor burden and osteolytic damage with negligible off-target effects, whereas systemic DTX at up to 4-fold higher doses had no impact on tumor progression yet elicited hepatic and hematologic toxicity.  However, many patients with bone BC likely will have previously received DTX. From this perspective and recognizing the stem cell nature of breast cancer bone metastases, a camptothecin (CPT) Sn2 lipase-labile prodrug (CPT-PD) was developed to offer a new patient-naive treatment. CPT is a topoisomerase 1 (TOPO 1) inhibitor with powerful hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1?) inhibitor that is cytotoxic to cancer stem cells. This proposal investigates the efficacy and safety the ?v?3-CPT-PD-MP or ?v?3-DTX-PD MP nanosystems against the bone BC tumors, micro-metastases, dormant tumor cells to provide potent therapy to bone and to reduce the risk of breast cancer relapse from micrometastases.  This proposal addresses the unmet therapeutic challenge and medical need posed by BC bone metastases. This project will delineate the bone BC efficacy and safety of ?v?3-Sn2-prodrug micelles and also elucidate the impact of key bone microstroma constituents such as TGF-? and ?v?3+ tumor associated macrophages (M2 TAMS) and ?v?3+ osteoclasts on treatment responses. The translational overarching goals are to more effectively treat patients with Stage 4 breast cancer in bone (Aims 1& 2), and to increase the enduring cure rate for Stage 1 to 3 BC patients by treating occult breast cancer micro-metastases to diminish disease relapse (Aim 3)."
"9607812","ABSTRACT Significance: With overall prevalence of ~1:5-7000 live births, lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) as a class are one of the most common childhood diseases. LSD are caused by lysosomal dysfunction, mainly due to lysosomal enzyme mutations, and are usually fatal in the first two decades of life. CNS pathology is present in ~75% of LSD, however, currently marketed enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), is not effective for LSD with significant CNS pathology because negligible enzyme levels are achieved in brain at therapeutic serum concentrations of enzyme. Inefficient enzyme uptake in somatic tissues, neutralizing antibody development, poor cost-effectiveness, and weekly IV infusions are other suboptimal attributes. Hunter Syndrome, caused by X-linked iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) mutations in 1:100,000 male births, is associated with severe neuropathology and broad somatic tissue pathology. Elaprase®, human recombinant I2S, does not address CNS pathology yet is offered to all patients and has sales approaching $600M yearly. Intrathecal I2S is currently in development. Innovation: NeuroNano Pharma proposes to develop an innovative polymer- based nanoparticle formulation of I2S which will be delivered subcutaneously to achieve therapeutic brain levels of I2S. This product will have a transformative impact on Hunter Syndrome patients and, by extension, holds promise for application of the technology to other LSD caused by enzyme mutations. Approach: Preliminary data from Dr. Alexander Kabanov?s laboratory with PICs containing enzymes shows that brain delivery, protection from antibody response, and negligible toxicity can be achieved with these formulations. After expression and purification at the UNC Center for Structural Biology, I2S will be incorporated into nanoscale core-shell polyion complexes (PICs) which form spontaneously in aqueous conditions via electrostatic interactions upon mixing of the anionic enzyme with a copolymer consisting of a cationic block and a hydrophilic nonionic block. Dr. Kabanov and Dr. Judy Riffle, experts in this field, will serve as consultants. I2S PIC formulations will be characterized with respect to physicochemical properties, enzyme activity, cytotoxicity, lysosome localization and brain levels. Two formulations will be selected for full pharmacokinetic characterization by Dr. William Banks (VA Puget Sound Health Care System), a blood brain barrier expert. In addition to its own laboratory facilities, NNP has access to all necessary equipment through the UNC Nanomedicines Characterization Core Facility. Expected Results: An optimized I2S PIC will be identified that will achieve at least a five-fold increase of I2S in brain parenchyma and lysosomes compared to free I2S and at least 50% serum bioavailability after SC injection. Extended serum t1/2 and broad somatic tissue uptake compared to free I2S is also desirable. In phase II, the I2S PIC will be tested in I2S knockout mice to demonstrate enhanced enzyme activity in the brain, efficacy against neuropathology, and protection from immune response. An optimized I2S PIC will be scaled up and tested in pre-IND GLP toxicology."
"9456039","Project Summary Carcinoma progression and metastasis are directed by interactions between epithelial tumor cells and components of the tumor cell microenvironment. In particular, cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions have been demonstrated to influence tumor growth, metastatic potential, and drug resistance. However, the complexity of ECM composition within in vivo tumor microenvironments has limited the understanding of the underlying mechanisms. We have recently developed a cell microarray platform that enabled the systematic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma cell drug responses within defined ECM microenvironments. This approach further facilitated the assessment of the role of ASCL1, a transcription factor associated with a subset of adenocarcinoma tumors exhibiting neuroendocrine differentiation. Building on these findings, we hypothesize that ECM composition influences adenocarcinoma cell signaling and sensitivity to drugs, and that neuroendocrine tumor cells are differentially regulated by ECM components. Here, we propose to examine these processes by incorporating both patient sample analysis and controlled in vitro experiments. In aim 1, we will examine the ECM composition within stage I adenocarcinoma tumor samples. We will aim to define patient-to- patient variation as well as evaluate potential differences between ASCL1(+) and ASCL1(-) tumors. In addition, we will explore potential correlations between ECM composition and patient outcome. In aim 2, we will investigate the effects of ECM on cell signaling and drug responses using adenocarcinoma cell lines with differential levels of ASCL1 expression. In these studies we will examine the functional effects of ECM and ASCL1 interactions. We anticipate that these studies will reveal new insights into the combinatorial regulation of drug responses and establish ECM expression profiles as potential biomarkers towards the personalization of lung adenocarcinoma treatments."
"9601425","Androgens have recently been recognized to play a major role in female fertility, both under normal and pathophysiological conditions. Traditionally, androgens are considered detrimental to ovarian function and are often associated with infertility. However, through generation of global and granulosa cell (GC)-specific androgen receptor (AR) knockout (ARKO) mouse models, others and we have pioneered a new concept that critical androgen actions through ARs are absolutely essential for normal ovarian function and female fertility. Our studies indicate that ARs expressed in GCs control pre-antral follicle growth and development to antral follicles, while preventing follicular atresia. However, to date, the underlying mechanism of AR actions in the ovary is poorly understood. Androgen functions are mediated by both ?genomic/nuclear? and ?non- genomic/extra-nuclear? actions of ARs. This RO1 proposal will study the physiological role and underlying mechanisms of membrane-initiated androgen actions during follicular development. Our studies show that androgen signaling via extra-nuclear ARs is critical for genomic intra-nuclear signaling and thus, the physiological effects of androgens in GCs involve a synergistic action between these two AR signaling pathways. We find that androgens promote follicular development and attenuate follicular atresia through both nuclear and extra-nuclear signaling pathways. The first portion of this grant focuses on further elucidating this ?outside-inside? cross talk between ARs, and its role in ovarian physiology. We have found that androgens through membrane-initiated AR signaling promote epigenetic changes in the genome by modifying histone methylation in GCs. Interestingly, epigenetic changes are now proposed to be a possible underlying cause of certain hyper-androgenic pathophysiological conditions in women, such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Therefore, we propose to determine the mechanism(s) by which androgens cause histone modifications, identify genes that are epigenetically regulated by androgens in GCs and determine its physiological significance with respect to follicular development and female fertility. In the second portion of this grant we concentrate our efforts on understanding the underlying mechanism of non-genomic, transcription independent effects of androgens in regulating follicular development. We have found two proteins; follicle stimulating hormone receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha that are regulated by androgens by a translation dependent pathway in GCs. We propose to use these two biologically relevant proteins as endpoints to elucidate how androgens promote translation in GCs. These proposed studies will provide novel insights about androgen signaling in general, with a specific focus on androgen actions in female reproduction. We believe that these studies will help us develop unique ways to control follicular development and thus female fertility, as well as identify potential biomarkers and/or therapeutic options for hyper-androgenic conditions in women."
"9420186","Project Summary Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an orphan hematologic malignancy that is clinically aggressive and fatal in most patients within one year of diagnosis. The disease pathogenesis is largely unknown, there is no standard treatment, and patients with BPDCN have a clear unmet medical need. The long-term goal is to improve outcomes in BPDCN by deeper understanding of disease biology. DNA sequencing in BPDCN revealed a high frequency of mutations in RNA splicing factors, with particular enrichment in loss-of-function mutations in ZRSR2 compared to other cancers. Functional assessment of patient tumors found that BPDCN is uniquely dependent on the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 and is highly sensitive to treatment with the BH3 mimetic venetoclax. New genetically engineered models of dendritic cell leukemia and BPDCN patient-derived xenografts offer a unique opportunity to test the contribution of disease alleles to splicing abnormalities and therapeutic response. The overall objective of this application is to test the hypothesis that genetic alterations associated with BPDCN contribute to dendritic cell transformation and create targetable vulnerabilities. Guided by strong preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory and an established network of expert collaborators, this central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine how ZRSR2 mutation promotes dendritic cell transformation; and 2) Identify factors that generate unique apoptotic dependencies in BPDCN. Under the first Aim, the applicant will use genetic models of ZRSR2 deficiency in dendritic cells and BPDCNs to determine how splicing mutations alter the transcriptome and cause transformation of the dendritic lineage. They will also test how mutations in ZRSR2, a gene located on the X chromosome that escapes X-inactivation in female cells, contributes to the male bias of BPDCN and sensitizes to splicing modulator therapy. Under the second Aim, the mechanisms of BCL2 dependence in normal and malignant dendritic cells will be investigated in human and mouse hematopoiesis. Adaptations to chemotherapy in BPDCN will be measured to determine if BCL2 inhibition can overcome chemoresistance, which is the major barrier to improved outcomes in patients. The approach is innovative by making use of novel model systems and samples from BPDCN patients on active clinical trials. The downstream effects of ZRSR2 mutations on BPDCN and male cancer predominance have not been clarified, and the mechanisms of protection from apoptosis in normal and malignant dendritic cells are unknown. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to define the biological role of clinically-relevant mutations in an understudied and highly fatal disease. The expected output for the proposed research is that the knowledge gained will be immediately clinically significant for patients with BPDCN because it will inform new treatment strategies in a cancer that is currently lacking in significant biological and therapeutic insight."
"9417075","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increased global aortic stiffness (AoS) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and impacts the large aging population. The pathogenesis of AoS-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be due to and potentiated by abnormal hemodynamics created by the interactions between the proximal aorta, left ventricle (LV), and distal vasculature. Both resting proximal AoS and exercise-induced increases in AoS likely play fundamental roles in LV remodeling, systolic and diastolic function, and the evolution of heart failure with a preserved LV ejection fraction (HFPEF), to which women may be particularly susceptible due to greater age- associated increases in AoS. The uniqueness and compliance of proximal aorta are reflected in its elastic composition, distinct from that of the distal aorta. Yet, this region has not been well evaluated due to limitations of traditional imagin techniques. This application will utilize cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), which fully images the proximal aorta and aortic arch, to study the properties of the local ascending and proximal descending aorta and regional aortic arch (collectively labeled CMR AoS). Dr. Tsao will investigate the relationships of CMR AoS with: 1) LV and central aortic hemodynamics (with rest/exercise in both hospital- based patients and community-dwelling individuals), 2) subclinical CVD reflected in echocardiographic LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction and increased carotid intima-medial thickness, and 3) prognosis of adverse clinical CVD outcomes, with comparison to risk prediction by global AoS. She will also conduct analyses of effect modification by gender in the relations of CMR AoS with her phenotypes of interest. Her preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of using CMR to target this crucial segment of the aorta and suggest associations with age, female sex, exercise blood pressure, and measures of adverse LV remodeling and function. Together, data from these studies will enhance the scientific community's understanding of the pathophysiologic relationships of AoS, and ultimately aim to identify targets for prevention and therapy.  Dr. Connie Tsao is a non-invasive cardiologist with clinical and research experience in CMR techniques and cardiovascular epidemiology, with a goal to continue patient-oriented and epidemiologic research applying non-invasive imaging to investigate vascular disease pathophysiology in an academic setting. The current proposal will expand Dr. Tsao's experience and training in the study of vascular physiology and imaging, as well as the longitudinal epidemiologic methods that she will employ in future expansion of her work. Her career development plan leverages the resources of her institutions, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/ Harvard Medical School and the Framingham Heart Study, to provide opportunities for continued learning and to synthesize a superb team of mentors, advisors, and co-investigators with complementary expertise in all aspects of this application. Dr. Tsao's mentors and advisors are all well-established and well-funded clinical and translational researchers who will supervise her training and support her transition to independence."
"9407157","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Following injury or primary cell culture, quiescent differentiated vascular smooth muscle (VSMDIFF) cells undergo phenotypic switching to a synthetic phenotype (VSMSYN) characterized by high rates of cellular proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, motility and pro-inflammatory function. This process includes changes in expression of channels and pumps involved in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, several of which have been targeted in vitro to inhibit vascular remodeling associated with injury and disease. A significant challenge is to understand how Ca signals are transduced to regulate VSMSYN -specific function. 2+ In previous funding periods we characterized expression and function of multifunctional serine/threonine Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in VSM. We first discovered that expression of a CaMKII? splice variant was increased in rat VSM following arterial injury, functionally promoting VSM cell proliferation, migration and neointima formation. Conversely, CaMKII? expression rapidly decreases in parallel with VSMDIFF phenotype markers, conditional knockout results in enhanced vascular remodeling following vascular injury, and conversely over-expression inhibits VSMSYN function and vascular remodeling. (Preliminary studies). These results indicate that CaMKII? and ?-isoforms have non-equivalent functions in VSM. Novel preliminary studies suggest coordinate regulation of CaMKII?- by microRNA-30 family members and CaMKII? by promoter DNA methylation/de-methylation. It is hypothesized that reciprocal regulation of CaMKII?- and ?-isoform expression in VSM, and the relative isoform composition of CaMKII holoenzymes, is a determinant of vascular remodeling in response to injury and disease. Three related but independent specific aims are proposed to: Aim 1. establish cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying opposing CaMKII-isoform function in regulating arterial remodeling in response to injury using novel genetic mouse models, a femoral artery wire injury protocol, and in vitro cell culture studies; Aim 2. Using the same approaches, test a novel mechanism and functional consequences of reciprocal regulation of CaMKII? and ?-isoform expression by miR-30 and DNA cytosine methylation in vivo and in vitro; and Aim 3. Evaluate the functional importance of VSM cell CaMKII signaling and isoform dynamics in a clinically relevant context, i.e. the process of arteriovenous-fistula maturation and failure studied in a mouse model of AVF failure and correlated with analyses of human failed AVF specimens following surgical revision."
"9442300","Project Summary / Abstract Computed tomographic colonography (CTC), or virtual colonoscopy (VC), has been confirmed as a viable and cost-effective alternative to optical colonoscopy for colon cancer screening by large-scale and multi-center clinical trials. Cathartic bowel preparation is one of the major drawbacks for the wide acceptance of CTC as a mass screening tool. The main technical barrier to applying non-cathartic bowel preparation to CTC examination (ncCTC) is the lack of an accurate visualization method to subtraction of tagged fecal residuals in CTC images. Current solution is applying an image processing method named electronic cleansing (EC), or digital bowel cleansing, for removing tagged fecal regions in CTC images after image acquisition. However, an accurate and artifact-free EC solution has not been found in clinical research, in particularly for ncCTC. Applying dual-energy CT (DE-CT) to ncCTC image acquisition (nc-DE-CTC) provides a promising solution to differentiating tagged fecal materials from colonic soft-tissue structures. However, current EC methods in DE-CTC utilize only the differences in Hounsfield (HU) value to characterize tagged fecal materials. These methods are thus heuristic and incomplete to overcome the major EC artifacts in nc-DE-CTC. Based on our recent finding that the DE-CT derived effective atomic numbers (Zeff) by fractions of atomic mass number are substantially higher in air and iodine-tagged fecal materials (the two substitutes in colonic lumen) than those in soft tissue and fat, we will develop an innovative dual-energy EC (DE-EC) method, named ZEC, by utilization of a Zeff transfer function for direct visualization of the colonic soft-tissue structures and suppression of tagged fecal materials without explicit segmentation and removal of tagged fecal materials in CTC images. The central hypothesis is that the DE-CT derived effective atomic number (Zeff) is an accurate physical parameter for characterizing colonic lumen (air and the tagged fecal residuals) from colonic soft-tissue structures in nc-DE-CTC images, which provides the physical model for the development of the proposed ZEC method. The primary aim is to develop a Zeff-based DE-EC scheme for direct visualization of nc-DE-CTC images without applying explicit segmentation of tagged fecal regions in conventional EC, and to evaluate the performance of the proposed ZEC scheme in reading of nc-DE-CTC in reference to the ?ground truth? established by optical colonoscopy. The successful development and validation of the proposed ZEC scheme will deliver an accurate and efficient solution for artifact-free visualization of ncCTC images, substantially improve patient adherence and compliance to undergoing CTC examination, and thus promote the acceptance of CTC as a highly reliable and cost-effective colon cancer screening strategy."
"9326012","Project Description Current treatments for multiple myeloma suffer from rapid evolution of drug resistance and have major side effects such as degeneration of the nervous system and neutropenia (decrease in white blood cells, thereby predisposing patients to infections). Thus innovative drugs with fewer side effects and efficacy in refractory disease urgently need to be approved, especially when considering that the disease itself causes numerous end-organ toxicities in an elderly patient population. ONC201 is a clinical-stage, first-in-class small molecule with striking preclinical anti-cancer activity that is the most potent in multiple myeloma compared to other tumor types and is effective without causing side effects in animals. This novel compound imparts its antitumor effects through a unique, previously undiscovered mechanism of action that involves activation of the integrated stress response that multiple myeloma cells are very sensitive to. Several academic investigators at premier institutions have demonstrated the optimal preclinical profile of ONC201 in a multitude of models and have found that this drug is especially effective against B-cell malignancies, such as the orphan disease multiple myeloma. Therefore the safety, mechanism, and preclinical efficacy of ONC201 warrants clinical evaluation in a phase I/II trial in multiple myeloma patients who have limited treatment options. Phase I of the trial will perform dose-escalation to establish a safe treatment dose and phase II of the trial will evaluate the monoagent efficacy of ONC201 in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients. The proposal has the following aims: Aim #1: To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and primary efficacy of ONC201 when administered orally once every 3 weeks; Aim #2: Evaluate the clinical efficacy of ONC201 in multiple myeloma. These studies will provide information for the formulation of a development path for ONC201 to treat relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: pharmacokinetics, identification of safe dose for subsequent testing, type I biomarkers for patient selection, and type II biomarkers for evaluation of mechanism and kinetics of response. ONC201 represents a transformative treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma as a safe, mutation-agnostic, and orally active inducer of the integrated stress response in refractory cancers. This proposal seeks to make a novel anticancer agent available to patients in need of treatment options and will push the novel product towards commercialization that would open the availability of this drug to patients in need on a global scale. Furthermore, these studies will advance the field by enabling the clinical evaluation of a first-in-class representing a novel therapeutic mechanism that offers superior safety and efficacy that is orthogonal to available multiple myeloma therapies.  "
"9439461","Project summary:  Ovarian cancer (OC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States. The clinical treatment of OC is marked by high initial response rates to 1st line standard-of-care (SOC) platinum/taxane treatment, but also significant relapse rates. A major unmeet need in this disease exists to identify optimal 2nd line therapy options in the platinum resistant or refractory setting which yield superior outcomes compared with current treatment selection which is largely empirical.  Many single and combination agents are currently in use or in clinical trials as 2nd line treatments for OC, but there are few reliable biomarkers available to predict response to these various types of cytotoxic or targeted chemotherapies. Recent studies have identified potential genomic and other markers, including BRCA1/2, VEGF, MAPK, PI3K and others. Advances in biomarker identification, however, are slow because each trial only administers a single therapy on every patient at a given time, and thus only allows biomarker/phenotype correlations on one therapy at a given tumor state. We have developed a technology that allows us to measure the phenotypic effect of a large number of distinct agents or drug combinations within a single tumor in a rapid and minimally invasive manner and without systemic toxicities. The technology represents a new paradigm for predicting proactively, rather than empirically, the effect of drugs inside a patient tumor. Consisting of implantable microdevices, which release microdoses of up to 120 distinct agents or combinations in parallel into small confined regions of tumor, it allows for direct measurement of drug/tumor interaction using established pharmacodynamic readouts for each therapy tested within the native tumor microenvironment.  This proposal seeks to translate the microdevices into clinical use through a pilot trial in ovarian cancer patients. Up to 6 microdevices will be implanted into omental tumors one day prior to surgery where they are expected to provide a rapid and comprehensive snapshot of how the tumor actually responds to all the available therapies. 6 spatially separated readouts from distinct parts of the tumor will also provide a novel functional examination of tumor heterogeneity. All of the readouts will be correlated with genomic, transcriptomic, immune and tissue biomarkers, effectively performing 20 or more biomarker trials in each patient with six-fold replicates, with only one extra biopsy procedure, and at minute drug exposure levels.  This unprecedented clinical study seeks to validate safety, usage and procedures for obtaining multiple drug phenotypes from microdevices within patients, and to significantly expand the field's understanding of predictive biomarkers in ovarian cancer. If successful, this research may lay the foundation for application of this drug screening microdevice beyond ovarian cancer.   "
"9402603","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We discovered a phenomenon called exercise resistance, where insulin resistant individuals do not respond normally to a single bout of exercise with respect to expression of PGC-1? and other genes). To generate hypotheses regarding why this happens, normal glucose tolerant volunteers had one exercise bout with muscle biopsies at rest and 30 min after exercise. We found that 216 mRNAs corresponding to 130 genes changed significantly after exercise. Transcriptional regulators were significantly over-represented. Analysis of the 5' untranslated regions of the affected genes showed significant enrichment in transcription factor response elements, including motifs for NFKB1, RELA, SP1/KLF family, and EGR1. Analysis of the 5' UTR of these transcription factors revealed one common potential transcriptional regulator, myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1). The change in MZF1 expression after exercise was positively correlated with insulin sensitivity. MZF1 expression also was increased markedly in insulin resistant obese and diabetic patients, suggesting dysregulation of this system. We used these experiments to conduct a closer examination of more factors that regulate mRNA and protein abundance. Among these, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate much of gene expression and translation events. Preliminary Data shows that, in healthy people, exercise increases microRNAs that target FOXO1 mRNA, and FOXO1 protein is increased in obese and type 2 diabetic muscle, accompanied by decreased FOXO1 phosphorylation, indicating potential activation of the FOXO1 transcriptional program in insulin resistant muscle. There are few data on how exercise and insulin sensitivity interact in skeletal muscle with regard to global miRNA expression events in human muscle. Finally, the expression of PPAR? and its downstream targets decreased 30 minutes after acute exercise in an insulin sensitivity-related manner. In mice PPAR? overexpression in muscle worsens and PPAR? knockout improves insulin sensitivity. Thus, PPAR? activation in muscle may detrimental to insulin sensitivity, and begs the question of whether treatment with fibrates to lower plasma lipids could work against insulin sensitizing effects of exercise in skeletal muscle. The overall goal of this project is to understand the interplay between insulin sensitivity and the gene expression response to exercise in skeletal muscle. Although substantial data is available in mice and in vitro systems, the applicability of these data to human disease is required. We propose: 1. To determine whether the transcription factor expression response to exercise is dysregulated in muscle from type 2 diabetic patients; 2. To determine how insulin resistance changes the response of posttranslational modifications of SP1/KLF family and MZF1 transcription factors to acute exercise in muscle from type 2 diabetic patients; 3. To define the response of miRNAs to acute exercise in healthy and insulin resistant muscle from obese and type 2 diabetic patients; 4. To determine whether treatment with PPAR? agonist fibrate derivatives suppresses the normal gene expression response to acute exercise."
"9432110","Project Summary Specialized sensory organs contain functionally dedicated cell types that detect relevant stimuli and relay information to the nervous system. In this proposal, we ask if this concept also pertains to the gut epithelium, which constitutes one of the largest exposed surface areas of the human body and is in contact with a diverse chemical environment. Indeed, numerous chemical changes in the gut lumen have been associated with visceral pain, including irritants, endogenous inflammatory molecules, and microbiota-produced metabolites. Despite growing interest in the gut-neural axis, relatively little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying chemosensory transduction by the gut epithelium, or how this information is transmitted to the nervous system. Serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells are rare, but highly specialized entities within the gut epithelium that have been implicated in visceral pain but have eluded detailed characterization due, in part, to their paucity. To circumvent these limitations, we generated intestinal organoids from a transgenic mouse in which EC cells are marked with a fluorophore, enabling us to carry out detailed single-cell profiling of these cells in the context of a native tissue environment. Our preliminary data show that these cells are electrically excitable, polymodal chemosensory detectors of the gut that engage in direct synaptic interactions with sensory nerve fibers to transduce information about intestinal state. In these proposed studies, we will define intrinsic EC cell electrophysiological properties, chemosensory transduction mechanisms, and serotonin release mechanisms (Aim 1) and utilize this information to investigate the physiological effects of EC activation on and associated neural pathways (Aim 2). Finally, we will obtain genetic access to EC cells and use chemogenetic tools to examine their contribution to visceral pain (Aim 3). This work will elucidate EC cell chemosensory mechanisms and examine their role in visceral pain to provide a mechanistic foundation for understanding how the gut epithelium communicates with the nervous system. This molecular foundation is critical for uncovering basic mechanisms that contribute to pathophysiology underlying visceral pain disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome. Proposed experimental approaches for this award combine my expertise in cellular physiology and biophysics with new training in genetics and GI physiology, allowing me to address significant biological questions and identify novel molecular mechanisms. A unique mentorship team with extensive experience in signal transduction, pain, synaptic physiology, and GI physiology will provide expert guidance and an ideal environment for proposed scientific and professional development. Thus, the training supported by this award will be critical to establishing a unique and important independent research program in neuroscience and gastrointestinal physiology."
"9495566","Project Summary  Jogyamycin is an aminocyclopentitol natural product and belongs to the same family of molecules that includes pactamycin and cranomycin as well as other members. The biological activity of jogyamycin has been briefly studied, showing that it has exceptional activity against drug-resistant malaria and the parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness. Pactamycin and other molecules in this family have also shown anti-protozoal, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer activity. One issue with these molecules is that they also exhibit potent cytotoxic effects that have limited their therapeutic development. Exploring the mode of action of these molecules may yield a strategy for alleviating this cytotoxicity. This family of molecules prevents protein synthesis from occurring by binding to a region of the ribosome that is highly conserved across all domains of life. Despite these similar binding pockets, small changes to the core structure of these molecules can have dramatic influence on their biological activity. How these small structural changes play a role in determining the biological activity is currently poorly understood, but would be of great value in creating less cytotoxic analogs. The objective of this research is to develop a predictive binding model that indicates which structural features are important for binding to the eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomes. Developing this model will be enabled through an enantioselective synthesis of jogyamycin which can be altered to access different analogues.  Jogyamycin is a challenging molecule where every carbon of the cyclopentane scaffold contains a heteroatom substituent. Furthermore, there are three contiguous carbons bearing different aminated functional groups as well as three contiguous fully substituted carbons. Current syntheses to access related compounds are unamendable to synthesizing jogyamycin and its analogs, requiring a new synthesis. This proposed 14 step enantioselective synthesis of jogyamycin will utilize a few key reactions, including an asymmetric reductive aldol reaction, a metal-mediated nitrene C-H insertion and a ring closing metathesis.  To develop a predictive binding model, energies will be calculated for the binding of jogyamycin and other related molecules to both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. Furthermore, binding energies of several analogues will be calculated to evaluate how these systematic changes affect the binding energies. The analogues will then be synthesized by using the previously developed synthesis of jogyamycin as a template. These analogues will then be tested using biological assays for bacteria, malaria and cancer. The relative biological activity will then be compared to the calculated binding energy to validate or refine our predictive model. This would further expand our understanding of the relative importance of each structural feature to binding. This fundamental knowledge gained through both computational and experimental techniques would be useful for developing future generations of jogyamycin analogs that exhibit limited cytotoxicity while also maintaining potent activity against a variety of diseases."
"9452248","Project Summary Michelle T. Long, MD, is a faculty member of the Boston Medical Center, Division of Gastroenterology and an Assistant Professor at the Boston University (BU) School of Medicine. Her research has focused on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as measured by computed tomography scan in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). In her prior work, she has evaluated the association between NAFLD and physical activity and NAFLD and sub- clinical measures of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the FHS cohort. Her work in these areas has resulted in 4 first author publications including the development and validation of a simple clinical diagnostic score for hepatic steatosis called the Framingham Steatosis Index. Her recent study utilizing blood-based non-invasive hepatic fibrosis markers in the FHS determined that the available fibrosis markers give widely disparate predictions of the risk for significant hepatic fibrosis when applied to this community-based cohort. NAFLD associated hepatic fibrosis is an important public health problem. More than 15 million Americans are estimated to suffer from hepatic fibrosis from NAFLD which worsens metabolic disease and increases the risk of liver- related and CVD- related death. Studies to date examining NAFLD in community-based cohorts in the United States have relied on imaging modalities that are insensitive to hepatic fibrosis. Dr. Long's proposal will focus on testing three hypotheses; 1) FHS participants with hepatic fibrosis, as measured by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), have a more adverse CVD risk factor profile compared to those with no fibrosis, 2) Genetic determinants for the risk of hepatic fibrosis are identifiable by genome wide association studies and 3) A diagnostic model based on clinical and genetic traits distinguishes NAFLD patients with and without fibrosis as defined by VCTE and the model performs well when applied to an external validation cohort. The study of the clinical and genetic traits associated with hepatic fibrosis in the community will lead to insights into disease mechanisms, biomarker development, and novel therapeutic targets, which has the potential to improve public health. This study will be performed as an ancillary study of approximately 3,500 FHS Third Generation and OMNI 2 cohort participants who are undergoing evaluation for hepatic fibrosis using VCTE. Dr. Long?s ultimate career goal is to use epidemiological insights for two purposes: a) identify potential novel drug targets; and b) develop tools to identify high risk NAFLD patients to prevent disease progression. To complete this proposal and progress towards these goals, Dr. Long has developed a five year mentored career development program that incorporates both didactic and formal research training guided by two well established investigators with expertise in clinical and translational research in CVD and NAFLD.

"9405549","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the mechanisms used by the brain to represent, and compute with, uncertain information marks a fundamental quest in systems neuroscience. Organisms often make decisions based on observations that are inherently uncertain due to noisy sensors and ambiguity in the world. To optimally perform such tasks, it is necessary for the brain to represent and utilize knowledge of sensory uncertainty. Behavioral studies have demonstrated that in certain tasks, humans perform close to optimally, implying that the brain represents and utilize uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis. The theoretical framework of probabilistic population coding (PPC) postulates that the brain encodes sensory information in the pattern of population activity by representing a likelihood function over the stimulus. Although PPCs have been used to construct implementations of several Bayesian computations using neurally plausible operations, there has been no population-level physiological evidence that this is the coding scheme used by the brain.  The proposed project combines electrophysiology (multi-neuronal recordings) and computational neuroscience with the goal to elucidate how the brain represents and computes with sensory uncertainty during visual decision-making. The project will use a simple orientation classification task previously designed in our laboratories. Optimal performance on this task requires the observer to utilize sensory uncertainty on trial-by- trial basis, and human and monkeys have been shown to perform near optimally. In Aim 1, population recordings in primary visual cortex will be combined with behavioral measurements to determine whether sensory uncertainty is encoded in this area, specifically, as likelihood functions in accordance to PPC. In Aim 2, simultaneous recordings from prefrontal cortex will be used to test whether there exists functional correlation between V1 and prefrontal cortex due to shared uncertainty information encoding. Taken together, the proposed work will be the most comprehensive test to date of Bayesian computation in perceptual decision- making, with a particular focus on PPC as the leading encoding framework to be tested. Understanding how the brain implements sensory uncertainty promises to usher in a new generation of neural networks, with possible applications to developing neuroprosthetic devices with improved decoding from cortical populations."
"9410933","PROJECT SUMMARY: This new F30 application proposes preclinical research to examine interactions between opioid pharmacology and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIPN) produced in male and female rats by the commonly administered antineoplastic drug paclitaxel (PTX). PTX is known to cause a CIPN frequently associated with behavioral depression that cannot be fully reversed by treatment with mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists. Recently, clinical studies have demonstrated an increased vulnerability to opioid abuse in patients treated with MOR agonists for chronic cancer pain, finding a high rate of abuse in this cohort. This application will test the hypothesis that PTX is able to alter MOR functioning in different regions of the central nervous system (CNS) resulting in depression of behavior, reduced efficacy of MOR agonists to produce analgesia, and increased sensitivity to abuse-related effects of MOR agonists. To evaluate this hypothesis, this proposal includes novel studies to investigate a sustained, neuropathy-associated depression of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) and of increase in mechanical allodynia in male and female rats. Behavioral studies will investigate the impact of PTX on the effectiveness of acute and repeated morphine to produce analgesic and abuse-related effects. Finally, complementary neurochemical studies will examine the effect of PTX on MOR signaling using the functional assay of agonist-stimulated [35S]GTP?S binding in regions of the CNS associated with pain, analgesia, and abuse. Completion of this project will provide an improved understanding of the mechanisms of CIPN-associated depression of behavior and the behavioral and neurochemical implications of PTX-treatment for MOR functioning and opioid abuse."
"9411734","PROJECT SUMMARY Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disease mediated by T cell entry into pancreatic islets and the subsequent destruction of insulin-producing ? cells. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a critical inhibitory population that prevents autoimmunity in most individuals, but ultimately fails to prevent disease onset in patients with T1D. However, the mechanistic basis for this ?Treg insufficiency? remains poorly understood. We have recently identified a neuropilin-1:semaphorin-4a (Nrp1:Sema4a) axis that is required to maintain Treg stability, survival and function in mouse models of human cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Treg-restricted loss of this pathway in mice leads to profound resistance to tumor growth, due to an inability to restrain anti-tumor immunity, but did not lead to loss of homeostatic Treg function that might have led to systemic inflammation and autoimmunity. This suggested that Tregs only require the Nrp1 pathway in inflammatory lesions, although it is not known if this pathway is used by Tregs in autoimmune diabetes. Surprisingly, while Treg-restricted loss of Nrp1 did not impact autoimmune diabetes, but enhanced Nrp1 signaling induced by ectopic ligand expression on islet ? cells reduced diabetes by ~50%. Further preliminary analysis of intra-islet Tregs revealed a progressive and selective loss of Nrp1, which limited the capacity of Tregs to use this pathway. In this competitive renewal application, we will determine if the Nrp1 pathway impacts autoimmune diabetes, and if enforced utilization limits Treg insufficiency and autoimmune diabetes. AIM 1: On the molecular basis of Treg insufficiency in autoimmune diabetes. In this Aim, we will ask: (A) Does enhanced intra-islet Nrp1-Treg ligation mediate protection from autoimmune diabetes? (B) What is the functional impact of Nrp1 loss on intra-islet Treg function? (C) What is the mechanism of Nrp1 shedding? (D) What drives Nrp1 shedding? AIM 2: Approaches to negate Treg insufficiency in autoimmune diabetes. In this Aim, we will ask: (A) Can Treg function be enhanced by nanoparticle-mediated delivery in vivo? (B) Can Treg function be enhanced in vivo using HSV-mediated gene delivery? This project will have a significant impact on our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie Treg insufficiency in autoimmune diabetes, and determine if two translational proof-of-concept approaches can boost Treg function/survival and limit autoimmune diabetes. Given that we discovered and elucidated the Nrp1 pathway and its physiological impact on Treg function/survival, and have many unique tools to probe its function, we are in the best position to conduct this research."
"9407792","Project Summary  Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease. Even small, but persistent increases in arterial blood pressure lead to pathological remodeling of the vessels and heart, and are associated with reduced life expectancy. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) contractility and remodeling are two critical Ca2+-dependent mechanisms that contribute to hypertension. The highly Ca2+-selective plasma membrane (PM) Orai channel proteins which are controlled by the universal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensor protein, STIM1 are upregulated in VSMC during hypertension. Our published and preliminary data demonstrate that Store-independent Orai channels (SICs) are encoded by heterohexamers of two exclusively mammalian proteins: Orai3 and the long variant of Orai1, Orai1?. We demonstrated that Orai1?/3-SIC is required for VSMC migration and for neointima formation after vascular injury, yet does not play a role in proliferation. Orai1?/3-SIC expression and activity are specifically upregulated in VSMC during hypertension. Our major objective is to determine the role and regulation of this unique Orai1?/3-SIC in VSMC dysfunction during hypertension. We hypothesize that Orai1?/3-SIC generate Ca2+ signals in VSMC that control unique downstream pathways to mediate contractility and/or remodeling in hypertension. We propose three aims. 1: To determine the specific heteromeric assembly and regulation of native Orai1?/3-SIC in VSMC. The oligomeric state and mode of regulation by Ca2+ of native Orai1?/3-SIC will be investigated using novel fluorescently-labeled Orai isoforms expressed at endogenous levels in Cas9/CRISPR Orai-knockout VSMC. These studies will combine high-resolution FRET and confocal imaging and biophysical channel measurements using mutant and concatenated Orai1?/3 hexameric channel constructs. 2: To elucidate the downstream SIC-specific signaling pathways and determine the spatial and temporal Orai1?/3-generated Ca2+ microdomains in migrating VSMC. Having established the role of Orai1?/3-SIC in migration, we will utilize novel light-activated Orai-derived single-molecule probes containing tethered genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicators, to define Orai1?/3-generated Ca2+ signals, their PM localization and the immediate signaling pathways and long-term transcriptional regulation in migrating VSMC. 3: To determine the in vivo role of Orai1? and Orai3 in vascular dysfunction, contractility and remodeling in hypertension. Using Orai1?SMC-/- and Orai3SMC-/- mice expressing ratiometric GCamp5/mCherry Ca2+ indicator exclusively in SMC, we will determine the specific role of VSMC Orai1?/3-SIC-mediated Ca2+ signals in hypertension and associated vascular dysfunction. This proposal will use mechanistic and translational approaches to enhance our understanding of VSMC physiology and pathophysiology, and establish VSMC Orai1? and Orai3 as novel therapeutic targets in hypertension and other vascular diseases."

"9397978","In modern prosthetics a suction liner provides a mechanical connection to the rigid socket by ?gripping? the residual limb of the patient by either skin traction or suction. Conventionally, liners are made from materials that are impermeable to water such as silicone and polyurethane. Prolonged moisture accumulation inside the liner adversely affects fit and contributes to issues such as maceration (tissue softening from constant water exposure), breakdown, and infection, as well as issues of comfort and hygiene.  Managing this issue could revolutionize the clinical implementation of this widely used suspension system. We propose to develop a new type of advanced-material prosthetic liner system that maintains skin traction and suction but also absorbs, wicks, channels, and manages the water from sweat. This material will improve clinical practice by providing a more stable, comfortable, and less problematic interface between the limb and socket. Our objective is to develop a highly cross-linked prototype hydrated material system, for use in place of the water-impermeable silicone liner, to maintain airless skin traction and suction while managing sweat and keeping a static volume in relation to water content. This new liner material will require the development of two advanced materials, a sweat- transporting medium incorporating silicone cellulose nanocrystal nanocomposites (CNCs), and a polymer/clay aerogel which can absorb and retain moisture until it is deliberately removed. Both of these materials will be developed and tested to optimize their mechanical and sweat-diffusion properties. Finally, these materials will be layered along with a third, sealant layer made of standard liner silicone into a three-layered prototype for further mechanical, sweat management, durability, and regeneration testing as well as hygiene examination coupled to functional evaluation of the material in a rigid  walking boot. Improving water management in this critical component will fundamentally improve standard of care for a large population of lower and upper limb amputees."
"9545470","Project Summary Approach: We will test how the human transcription factor CREM (cAMP responsive element modulator) protects from colitis due to Entamoeba histolytica and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Successful completion of these studies will identify how and where CREM acts to guard against bowel injury. Significance: The importance of this project derives from the contribution of amebiasis to diarrhea in children in the developing world and to the estimated one million Americans who suffer from IBD. Understanding how CREM protects may provide new approaches to the currently inadequate treatments of amebic colitis and IBD. Progress: The past 5 years of support advanced the understanding of amebic colitis and resulted in 26 original research papers, including Nature, Nature Microbiology, Scientific Reports and Cell Reports, and publication of 17 reviews. Innovative aspects of the proposal include that cAMP-regulated gene expression has not previously been considered to contribute to defense of the intestine. The environment for the work is a parasitology lab with ongoing investigation of amebiasis in humans, murine models and at the cellular level, which is led by the Principal Investigator with 3 decades of amebiasis research experience."
"9542027","Project Summary Influenza pandemics are caused by emergent novel influenza A viruses (IAVs) that transmit efficiently within human populations lacking preexisting immunity against the specific virus. After the significantly divergent genome sequences of novel HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 bat influenza A-like viruses (BIALVs) were identified, concerns have been raised that they may pose significant spillover threats to humans because antibodies to IAVs and influenza B viruses have no cross-reactivity to novel BIALVs. To understand these novel viruses, reverse genetics was established for both viruses. It was demonstrated that internal genes of these viruses are functional through generation of chimeric bat viruses that contain six internal genes from the bat virus and the ORF of both HA and NA from canonical IAVs. It was also shown that reassortant viruses that carry the classical IAV M gene by replacing the bat M gene in the genetic background of chimeric bat virus can be rescued. Bats have been shown to be seropositive to IAVs, frequently to the H9N2 viruses. Furthermore, bat cells from different species have been demonstrated to support human, swine and avian IAV replication. The bats could have been exposed to both BIALVs and IAVs, and reassortment might occur to generate novel viruses that can infect other species including humans. Recent studies showed that rescued BIALVs can infect canine and human cells. All facts suggest a zoonotic potential of novel bat viruses. However, little is known about the receptors of these novel viruses, infection and immunological responses in their natural hosts (bats), or how they are maintained and transmitted among their natural hosts. Whether bats can be infected by IAVs, and if they are infected, what role in the ecology of IAVs do these infections play? Significant knowledge is needed to understand these novel viruses and their potential threats to other species including humans. Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) were shown to be experimentally susceptible to the rescued wild type HL18NL11 virus. Therefore, it is hypothesized that Jamaican fruit bats can be used as a model organism for understanding novel BIALVs and their potential threats to other species including humans. This proposal includes three specific aims: 1) To determine BIALV infection kinetics and tropisms in bats, as well as identify cellular receptors; 2) To determine reassortment potential and mechanisms between BIALVs and classical IAVs; 3) To determine which bat adaptive immune responses are critical to controlling BIALV infection. The results from this proposal will provide novel insights into the biology and virology of novel BIALVs, reveal the association of identified viral sequences with bats, identify roles that bats may play in virus ecology, and address concerns regarding their potential threats to other species including humans, which are important for the both influenza and bat immunity research communities."
"9402660","Project Summary About 74% of schizophrenia patients discontinue use within 18 months of therapy due to either poor tolerability of incomplete efficacy. This underscores the need for novel and more effective therapeutic targets for schizophrenia treatment. Recent clinical studies suggested that the metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor (mGlu2/3) agonist LY2140023 had antipsychotic properties, providing a new alternative for the treatment of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, follow-up studies with LY2140023 showed either inconclusive results, or clinical outcomes that were not different from placebo. Our published data demonstrated that chronic treatment with atypical antipsychotics, such as with clozapine or risperidone, but not with typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, induces repressive histone modifications at the mGlu2 (Grm2) promoter in mouse and human frontal cortex. Remarkably, the translational significance of our preclinical findings has been validated by a recent post-hoc analysis: patients previously treated with typical antipsychotics responded to LY2140023, whereas the effects of LY2140023 in patients previously exposed to atypical antipsychotics did not differ from placebo. Our published and preliminary data also suggest that these repressive epigenetic modifications occurred through a signaling mechanism that requires a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5HT2A)-dependent enhancement of NF-?B transcriptional function via I?B?, which is followed by NF-?B-dependent up-regulation and increased binding of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) to the mGlu2 promoter. We have focused our investigation on the potential role of HDAC2 as the basic molecular mechanism underlying down-regulation of mGlu2 expression after chronic antipsychotic drug treatment. Our results are expected to provide a route to the identification of new and more effective epigenetic drugs to improve the currently limited response to treatment with glutamate antipsychotics."
"9599945","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diminished self-control is a major contributor to addiction. In order to develop new treatments, we hope to understand the neural bases of self-control. Here we propose to investigate persistence, a specific type of self-control in which a decision-maker commits to a choice and then has to adhere to it for an extended period of time (here, several seconds, although in theory it could be several years). Persistence mimics the process of abstinence from drug use, and ability to persist has predictive validity for drug addiction and relapse. We will train rhesus monkeys to perform a novel task in which they can reject or accept offers and, if they accept them, must persist in that decision across several seconds to obtain a larger reward. Recent studies suggest that dorsal and ventral portions of the prefrontal cortex contribute to sustaining persistence and succumbing to temptation respectively. We have previously identified a putative control signal in dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) neurons; these signals are a strong candidate for sustaining persistence. Our more recent studies suggest that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) neurons represent salient offer values, and may thus contribute to temptation processes that lead to persistence failure. Here we propose to record neuronal activity in both dACC and vmPFC to test these ideas directly. In a separate experiment, we will also electrically stimulate the dACC in order to test the hypothesis that stimulation there improves persistence. Successful completion of these studies will yield a basic understanding of the neuroscience of persistence, a critical first step n developing new treatments for addiction and other diseases of self-control."
"9402639","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Incessant damage of epithelial layer and lack of ordered epithelial regeneration are known to be the hallmarks of lung remodeling. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a critical role in epithelial apoptosis, and the subsequent pathology of lung remodeling. Patients with asthma exhibit increased airway structural remodeling marked by collagen deposition and smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, which correlates with decreased lung function, morbidity, mortality and increased health care costs. However, the mechanisms regulating the key steps leading to airway fibrotic remodeling in asthma are unknown. Our novel preliminary results demonstrate that allergen house dust mite (HDM), causes severe ER stress, activation of ER stress transducer-transcription factor, ATF6, disulfide isomerase ERp57 and disulfide bridges in proapoptotic Bak, leading to apoptosis of airway epithelial cells and production of growth factors from the injured airway epithelium, which is associated with airway fibrotic remodeling in mice. Importantly, we also observed that deletion of ATF6a and ERp57 or treatment with a chemical chaperone; tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) attenuated allergen induced airway fibrosis in mice. The central hypothesis to be addressed herein is that allergen exposure induces ER stress mediated apoptosis and injury to airway epithelial cells and subsequent production of fibrotic mediators leading to airway structural remodeling via the ATF6-ERp57-Bak signaling axis. In Specific Aim #1 we will determine the functional roles of ER stress transducer ATF6 in regulating allergen- induced expression of disulfide isomerase, ERp57, and subsequent induction of epithelial cell death and development of airway structural remodeling. The specific Aim #2 seeks to explore the functional requirement of allergen-induced protein disulfide isomerase ERp57 in disulfide mediated oligomerization of proapototic Bak to cause epithelial injury and subsequent development of airway remodeling. In Specific Aim #3 we will assess the efficacy of a chemical chaperone, TUDCA in alleviating ER stress and decreasing subsequent epithelial cell death, ultimately resulting in resolution of allergen-induced airway remodeling. We will use complementary human primary epithelial cell culture and mouse transgenic approaches, coupled with detailed biochemical analysis of these processes in mouse lung tissues. Completion of proposed experiments is likely to impart a significant knowledge on allergen-induced epithelial ER stress, and its transducers which may be targeted in the future using small molecule inhibitors to attenuate airway fibrosis. Furthermore, our project will evaluate the efficacy of a naturally occurring bile acid (TUDCA) in attenuating airway fibrosis. Given the dearth of treatment options in chronic asthma and fibrosis, TUDCA may prove to be an alternative therapeutic for treatment of airway remodeling."
"9417050","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Centrosome dysfunction is the leading cause of microcephaly and is also associated with sterility, ciliopathy, and cancer. As the microtubule organizing centers of most eukaryotic cells, centrosomes build the bipolar mitotic spindle that segregates the duplicated genome into two daughter cells during cell division. In addition, centrosomes orchestrate numerous critical tasks during interphase, such as cell polarization, ciliogenesis, cell migration, and intracellular trafficking. The proposed research seeks to uncover  novel paradigms of centrosome regulation. The results from this work are likely to fundamentally reshape current models of how centrosome activity is controlled in healthy and diseased cells.  While most centrosome studies focus on maturation, the recruitment of proteins to the centrosome at mitotic onset, how centrosomes are regulated during interphase is little understood. In Aim 1, I will determine how centrosome function is regulated during interphase by Pericentrin-like-protein. Further, I propose to investigate the unknown roles of mRNAs that were previously localized to centrosomes. Many of these transcripts encode regulators of centrosome activity. In Aim 2, I propose to visualize mRNAs that localize to centrosomes and to investigate RNA localization mechanisms. I hypothesize that mRNA localization is an efficient strategy to quickly and locally control centrosome activity. To test this hypothesis, I will elucidte the mechanism and function of mRNA localization to centrosomes in Aim 3. Investigating these unexplored paradigms of centrosome regulation is essential to understand how centrosome function is modulated throughout the cell cycle and deregulated in disease.  The NHLBI K22 Career Transition Award will provide mentored research and career development training to support the successful completion of the proposed research and to facilitate my transition to career independence. This award proposal was developed to leverage my experience in mRNA localization with my current training in centrosome biology. As part of a comprehensive career development plan, the mentored phase will include hands-on instruction, formal workshops, mentoring opportunities, and science communication activities. New technical skills to be learned include fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, super resolution microscopy, cell culture, and CRISPR genome editing. To address deficiencies in these areas and to provide tailored career preparation, the mentors and expert members of an advisory committee, comprising both intramural and extramural investigators, will provide frequent discussion, feedback, and evaluation. With this information in hand, I will launch my independent career as a principal investigator. Findings from the proposed research will form the basis of an NIH R01 funding application. Further, the completion of the proposed work will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how centrosome activity is regulated, aspects of which may be deregulated in a disease setting."
"9448388","Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) has been shown to significantly improve the detection and characterization of soft-tissue lesions and reduce false positive recalls in breast cancer screening. However, DBT is still at its early stage of clinical use and continued improvement of the system design and reconstruction methods are crucial to fully exploit its potential. Noise and resolution are major factors in optimization of an imaging system. The noise in DBT is much higher than that in digital mammograms (DMs) because the multiple low-dose projections increase the total detector noise. The oblique incidence to the breast and the detector at large-angle projections further aggravates the noise problem and reduces spatial resolution. Synthetic mammograms cannot resolve these problems because they are generated from the DBT. It is known from CT that iterative reconstruction (IR) with properly designed regularizer can significantly reduce noise. However, IR for CT generally does not consider spatial blur and noise correlation/aliasing. Modeling these factors has recently started in CBCT that uses flat panel detectors. Model-based IR (MBIR) technology has not been developed for DBT. DBT is a limited-angle tomography, which, coupled with the very different target signals that are signs of breast cancer (microcalcifications, spiculated/ill-defined masses and distortions) than those in CT or CBCT, makes it much more challenging to develop MBIR for DBT.  The goal of the proposed project is to develop MBIR for DBT by accurate physics and statistics modeling of the imaging system to improve the image quality of DBT. We will develop accelerated reconstruction algorithms for these models to facilitate both research and eventual translation to clinical use of such methods. Our specific aims are: (SA1) prepare three data sets for development of the MBIR method (simulated DBT projection data, DBT projections of physical phantoms, and human subject DBT projections), and study the impacts of various image degrading factors on the reconstructed DBT; (SA2) develop MBIR by optimizing the design of the objective function and the iterative algorithm using the three types of data obtained in (SA1) and a four-tier approach; and (SA3) validate the developed MBIR method by comparison with current reconstruction techniques in terms of the detection accuracy of target signals by radiologists (ROC study) and by computer-aided detection (CAD) systems in human subject DBT images.  This project brings together two research teams with complementary expertise, one in imaging physics, image analysis and lesion detection in DBT, the other in statistical iterative reconstruction for CT/SPECT/ PET/MRI, to tackle this limited-angle reconstruction problem. If successful, DBT reconstructed with the new MBIR method is expected to improve the efficacy of early breast cancer detection and diagnosis and reduce dose. Reducing dose and noise will also facilitate the optimization of overall DBT system design, and development of advanced DBT techniques such as dual-energy contrast-enhanced DBT or dynamic contrast-enhanced DBT, which may be cost-effective alternatives to breast MRI for cancer diagnosis."
"9411115","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Obesity is the dominant cause of insulin resistance in man and it is the obesity epidemic, which is driving the dramatically increased incidence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Adipocyte dysfunction and chronic low-grade tissue inflammation are major causes of insulin resistance. In our recent work, we have reported that G protein- coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) is the functional receptor for omega-3 fatty acids (?3-FAs) producing robust anti-inflammatory, insulin sensitizing effects, both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, human genetic variants in the GPR120 gene had been described which predispose subjects to obesity and diabetes. The amount of ?3- FAs which would have to be consumed to sustain chronic agonism of GPR120 is too high to be practical, and, thus, a high affinity, small molecule GPR120 agonist would be of potential clinical benefit. Accordingly, GPR120 is a widely studied drug discovery target within the pharmaceutical industry. Recently, we have identified a high affinity, selective, small molecule GPR120 agonist (compound A; cpdA), which exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages in vitro, and in obese mice in vivo. GPR120 agonist treatment of HFD/obese mice results in anti-inflammatory signaling with improved glucose tolerance, decreased hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin sensitivity and decreased hepatic steatosis. This suggests that GPR120 agonists could emerge as new insulin sensitizing drugs for the treatment of T2D. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) represent current therapeutic agents for treating insulin resistance. However, these agents (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) are also associated with unwanted side effects, such as edema, weight gain, possible risk of heart failure, bone loss, and a possible correlation with certain cancers. While the exact mechanisms of TZD- induced insulin sensitization are not fully understood, these agents operate through PPAR?, and this subject has been extensively reviewed. Thus, both TZDs and GPR120 agonists can improve insulin resistance. Importantly, our recent preliminary data have suggested mechanisms whereby TZDs potentiate the effects of ?3-FAs at the same time that ?3-FAs potentiate the effects of TZDs, leading to a positive reinforcing system. In this project, we will explore the basic cellular mechanisms underlying the molecular interactions between PPAR? and GPR120. This concept also leads us to the novel hypothesis that the combination of PPAR? and GPR120 agonist treatment could produce additive or synergistic effects, leading to a greater degree of insulin sensitization than with either drug alone. Furthermore, combination treatment with a TZD plus a GPR120 agonist could lead to the use of much lower doses of TZDs, preserving the overall insulin sensitizing benefit, while mitigating unwanted side effects."
"9443852","Abstract / Summary  This revised competitive renewal seeks to extend the technical developments of the previous funding  period to validate and apply a novel diffusion-based MR imaging technique, quantitative temporal diffusion  spectroscopy (qTDS), that provides unique information on tissue microstructure and in particular can reveal early changes in tumors after treatment. In the previous cycle we developed this innovative method and  showed it is a sensitive indicator of changes in cell dimensions and tissue microstructure such as those that  occur with cell division and during apoptosis, before frank changes occur in cell density or tumor volume. As  such, qTDS has considerable potential for assessing whether specific treatment regimens are working, and so  may inform the selection of optimal therapies for patients and the reduction of avoidable side-effects. QTDS is  based on measurements of water diffusion rates over different time scales corresponding to different spatial  dimensions. We have previously shown it can detect changes in intracellular structure and cell sizes and  density, in cell cultures and in animal models, early in the course of a treatment and without some of the  confounding factors that affect other diffusion techniques, such as changes in cell membrane permeability. We  have performed theoretical analyses, computer simulations, and cell and in vivo animal studies, to understand  the factors that affect qTDS measurements, and have implemented the first practical qTDS acquisitions on a  human 3T scanner. In the current proposal we aim to extend our previous work and use qTDS as an in vivo imaging technique for non-invasive characterization of specific cellular changes which are currently  assessable only via invasive biopsy. We propose to validate qTDS in cell and animal models of cancer, and determine whether qTDS is capable of detecting treatment-induced cell size changes early in specific therapeutic regimens. We also propose to translate qTDS clinically by demonstrating its performance in predicting neoadjuvant treatment response in breast cancer. We hypothesize that qTDS is capable of  characterizing the distinct cellular changes associated with treatment-induced apoptosis, thereby providing an  innovative and unique means of assessing tumor response at an early stage of therapy. Our specific aims are:  [i] in a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, we will quantitatively map tumor cell size and density in vivo,  and validate the qTDS derived parameters on a voxel by voxel basis using using quantitative, co-registered  histology: [ii] in mouse models of breast cancer treated by different targeted drugs, we will evaluate qTDS as an imaging biomarker capable of detecting treatment-induced apoptosis and predicting treatment efficacy  early during therapy: [iii] In human breast cancer patients, we will evaluate qTDS as an imaging biomarker for  assessing breast tumor early response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and predicting treatment efficacy after the first and subsequent cycles of treatment by correlating imaging data with clinical and pathological  responses. The proposed qTDS method has the potential to measure cell size changes in vivo and improve  the assessment of treatment response and thereby contribute to personalized clinical cancer care."
"9414069","PROJECT SUMMARY This Program has defined what some have called a paradigm shifting pathway of neutrophilic inflammation which, unlike the ?classic? mode associated with IL-8, can become self-propagating in chronic inflammatory diseases such as COPD. Specifically, IL-8 initiates neutrophil (PMN) influx, the PMNs in turn release matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and prolyl endopeptidase (PE) which degrade collagen and generate the PMN-specific matrikine, proline-glycine-proline (PGP). In more common acute inflammatory circumstances, the PGP pathway is terminated by the aminopeptidase activity of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) which destroys PGP. Cigarette smoking (CS) can chemically modify and inactivate LTA4H?s aminopeptidase but not hydrolase activity as well as acetylate PGP rendering it immune to LTA4H. This drives persistently elevated PGP levels and chronic neutrophilic inflammation in COPD. In the Program?s journey to understand the PGP system, we have identified a novel potential prognostic biomarker for COPD, CF, and ARDS, linked matrix degradation to vascular leak, and discovered an anti-inflammatory role for a pro-inflammatory enzyme, LTA4H. PGP has also recently been shown to link extracellular matrix degradation to: acute lung injury, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic brain stroke, and modulation of acute pulmonary infection. Consequently, the discovery of the PGP system has particular significance as a fundamental mediator of pathophysiology in a number of disorders and organs. One enigmatic aspect of our studies has been an inability to generate PGP in vitro with collagen and the appropriate proteases in solution. The thesis of this R35 application is that this enigma is due to the requirement that PGP generating enzymes, such as PE, be exosome associated. This idea is supported by many observations, most notably, that airway exosomes from COPD patients, but not controls, are PMN-derived and cause a COPD-like phenotype when transferred to mice. Collectively, the findings led to our hypothesis that proteolytic exosomes constitute a new aspect of the inflammatory process and may participate in chronic inflammatory disorders such as COPD via the PGP pathway. If successful, the results of this project will define a novel entity, i.e. proteolytic exosome, which drives neutrophilic inflammation via PGP generation which is regulated by LTA4H and can cause a COPD-like disease in mice. In human studies, we will phenotype proteolytic exosomes and delineate whether they are biomarkers of COPD that correlate with disease parameters and can transfer pathology from humans to mice. In a smoking mouse model of COPD we will characterize the evolution of such exosomes and whether they can transfer disease from smoked to naïve animals. Although, the definition of a new pathogenic entity is daunting, the track record of this Program and the expertise of the PI and team suggest a successful endeavor. If so, a complete understanding of the proteolytic exosome may lead to new diagnostics and therapeutics for chronic inflammatory diseases such as COPD."
"9414575","ABSTRACT Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a leading cause of cancer death in children. The goal of my research is to use integrated genomic and epigenomic profiling to define the genomic alterations that drive leukemogenesis and treatment failure in ALL, and to use this information to develop mouse models to translate these discoveries to innovative therapeutic approaches. My research program has revised the molecular taxonomy of ALL, identified constellations of genetic mutations that define subtypes of ALL, has dissected the genetic basis of clonal evolution, identified new targets for therapeutic intervention, notably with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and has established several new engineered models of high-risk B-progenitor ALL. Recent advances include identification of a high frequency of mutations in epigenetic regulators at relapse in ALL, and demonstrating that specific genomic alterations perturb the interaction of leukemic cells with the microenvironment, resulting in resistance to therapy. This research proposal will determine the mechanistic basis by which genetic lesions present at diagnosis, or enriched at relapse, determine resistance to therapy, and exploit these for therapeutic intervention. Research goals are (1) to identify the constellations of genomic and epigenomic alterations that characterize each subtype of ALL across the age spectrum, and identifying those alterations that cause treatment failure. This involves genome and transcriptome sequencing of childhood and adult ALL, and integrated whole genome, whole genome bisulfite, transcriptome and chromatin mark sequencing of a cohort of 100 ALL cases, including matched samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse and corresponding xenografts. This is essential to identify all coding and non-coding mutations driving disease, to systematically examine the effect of genetic alterations on chromatin remodeling, and to guide the development and interpretation of mouse models of ALL. (2) To perform multiplexed loss-of-function screens using expression of founding oncogenic fusions, coupled with RNA interference and genome editing to dissect the interaction of polygenic alterations in leukemogenesis. (3) To use gene-specific and loss-of-function screens to examine the role of epigenomic alterations in ALL relapse. These include detailed characterization of Crebbp knockin models of ALL, and RNAi/CRISPR/Cas9 screens targeting over 700 chromatin modifier genes in B-ALL leukemia models. Enriched hits, and their effects on chromatin modeling and transcriptional regulation will be compared to data from human leukemic cells; and the resulting models used to test the effect of epigenetic modifying agents on modulating drug resistance. (4) To use mouse models of B-ALL to dissect the role of cellular mislocalization and ?hijacking? of the bone marrow niche and the role of this phenomenon in drug resistance. Together, these approaches provide a comprehensive strategy to fully define the genomic alterations driving treatment failure in ALL, and to mechanistically validate these in logical experimental systems to guide further drug development approaches."
"9470369","PROJECT SUMMARY Gap junctions are essential for maintaining rapid, synchronous, electrical coupling of cardiac muscle cells. This electrical coupling facilitates the healthy heart beat. Connexin43 (Cx43, gene name GJA1) is the predominant ventricular gap junction protein, and loss of Cx43 gap junction coupling leads to the arrhythmias of sudden cardiac death. The GJA1 mRNA undergoes internal translation to yield a truncated Cx43 isoform capable of modulating gap junctional coupling. The role of this truncated Cx43 isoform, GJA1-20k, in gap junction maintenance and the mechanism by which it regulates gap junctional coupling is unknown. The proposed research aims to provide insight into the role of internal translation and GJA1-20k in Cx43 gap junction formation, and how this process is regulated in the cell by addressing the following Aims; Aim 1: Test if TGF-? induced alteration in translation of GJA1 is sufficient to limit gap junction formation. Though promotion of internal translation and thereby GJA1-20k increase gap junctional coupling, the mechanism of this regulation is unknown. A cellular model of gap junction disassembly will be defined and applied to further study the role of GJA1-20k in maintenance of Cx43 gap junctions at the cell membrane. Aim 2: Determine if ribosomal protein s25 is necessary for internal translation of the GJA1 RNA and GJA1-20k expression.Levels of GJA1-20k are subject to dynamic regulation by the cell, indicating a mechanism by which the cell can alter the translational program. Ribosome specialization is a potential mechanism by which internal translation may be governed, and the ribosomal protein rps25 is a candidate driver of internal translation. The ability of rps25 containing ribosomes to promote internal translation of GJA1- 20k will be studied to define the role of rps25 in regulating internal translation. The proposed research will define the role of GJA1-20k in modulating gap junctional coupling and describe a mechanism of its regulation, identifying potential therapeutic targets for restoration of gap junctions in the failing heart."
"9415986","Project Abstract Hearing loss is a highly heterogeneous genetic disorder that makes diagnosis and treatment of patients challenging. Mutations in genes that result in syndromic hearing loss are often involved in the development of hair cells and auditory neurons. The discovery and study of genetic factors that contribute to the development of the inner ear will clarify the molecular etiology behind hearing loss and allow development of strategies to treat hearing loss. The short stature homeobox domain 2 (SHOX2) gene was identified as a candidate transcription factor involved in early development of auditory neuron through bioinformatic analysis. To better understand and recapitulate the role of human SHOX2 in inner ear development, zebrafish was chosen as a model organism. During embryonic development, zebrafish shox2 is expressed in the otic placode and later in the cranial ganglia which includes the statoacoustic neurons. I hypothesize that shox2 determines the cell fate of otic progenitors that give rise to neurons. I will evaluate auditory and vestibular behavior of zebrafish after morpholino knockdown of shox2. I will determine shox2 expression in otic progenitors by performing immunofluorescence in situ hybridization on zebrafish reporter lines that mark the otic progenitor pools. Furthermore, I will determine how shox2 knockdown affects the number of cells within each progenitor population. Finally, I will perform lineage tracing by generating and utilizing a tamoxifen inducible shox2-p2A?CreERT2 to mark progeny that arise from shox2 cells. These aims will clarify the role of shox2 in establishment of otic progenitor cells and potentially add this gene to a repertoire of factors responsible for hair cell and otic neuron development."
"9442071","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mitochondrial gene expression is an oft-cited target for antiparasitic drugs to combat the dangerous, insect- transmitted trypanosome parasites. Mitochondrial gene expression regulation, though likely crucial to parasite survival, is not well understood. The various steps in mitochondrial gene expression have been elucidated. However we still do not know the control mechanisms used to generate the proper ratios of mature mitochondrial mRNAs appropriate for each parasite life stage. The proposed project focuses on a piece of this puzzle: the populations of mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) 3' non-encoded adenine- and uridine-containing nucleotide ?tails? that are thought to regulate the post-transcriptional events that determine trypanosome mtRNA fates. The proposal considers that the function of tails may not be universal as in current models but rather that they play specific roles depending on their characteristics. Newly obtained data demonstrate a previously unrecognized range of compositional and length variations that differ between tail populations of the 18 encoded mtRNAs and also between tail populations in the insect and mammalian parasite life stages. However, the control mechanisms by which tail differences are established, are, with one major exception, entirely unknown, and the focus of this study. This proposal's specific hypothesis is that differential actions of two non-canonical poly(A) polymerases are responsible for transcript- and life stage-specific differences in trypanosome mtRNA tail compositions. The Aim 1 focus is the observed transcript-to-transcript variations in tail population characteristics, and Aim 1 hypothesis is that transcript-specific targeting of a minor polymerase (KPAP2) is responsible for these variations. The role of KPAP2 in achieving transcript-specific differences in tail compositions will be determined. Aim 2 will examine how stage-specific differences in tail populations are achieved. The primary polymerase KPAP1 can carry methylmarks on certain arginine residues that are likely to impact its RNA or protein interactions, thereby impacting function. The degree to which KPAP1 arginine methylation impacts tail addition in each life stage will be determined; the hypothesis is that life-stage specific differential methylation is the cause of at least some life stage differences in tail characteristics. These discoveries will be significant because they will provide us a means to perturb the differences in tail compositions between and within life stages and observe the impact various other post-transcriptional processes of trypanosome mitochondrial gene expression. In addition to the perspective of tail variation as a gene expression regulator, the other innovation of this proposal is technical: it utilizes a new technique to collect large populations of tail sequences. In summary, this work will uncover control mechanisms that result in differences in mtRNA tails that may ultimately be responsible for differences in relative abundances of mtRNAs within a single life stage and between life stages."
"9469298","Project Summary In Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) it is well recognized that autoreactive CD4 and CD8 T cells infiltrate the pancreatic islets leading to the destruction of insulin-producing ?-cells. We recently found that CD4 T cell clones isolated from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and humans with T1D recognize hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs) that consist of proinsulin peptides fused to other peptides present in ?-cell secretory granules. Our data suggest that HIPs play a central role in the pathogenesis of T1D and we hypothesize that a loss of immune tolerance in HIP-reactive T cells is responsible for loss of tolerance to the pancreatic islets as a whole. However, the factors that cause a loss of tolerance in T cells targeting HIPs are unknown. We also predict that HIPs will be optimal for use in antigen-specific tolerance induction strategies compared to conventional ?-cell autoantigens. Our aims will be to i) investigate how disease-susceptibility background genes contribute to a loss of tolerance in HIP-reactive CD4 T cells, and ii) determine if induction of tolerance to HIPs can prevent and reverse diabetes in NOD mice. To investigate how susceptibility genes other than MHC loci contribute to a loss of tolerance we will compare HIP-reactive T cell responses in NOD and diabetes-resistant mice that express the NOD MHC class II haplotype H-2g7 but do not carry susceptibility background genes (B6g7 mice). Understanding how HIP- reactive T cells are regulated in non-autoimmune B6g7 mice and how this fails in NOD mice is critical to understanding the pathophysiology of T1D. To determine if HIPs can be effectively used for antigen-specific tolerance induction, we are developing biodegradable nanoparticles loaded with HIPs. We plan to test the ability of HIP-loaded nanoparticles to prevent disease transfer by diabetogenic T cells and reverse spontaneous disease in NOD mice. These studies are likely to have a significant and lasting impact on T1D research and could potentially lead to the development of novel antigen-specific therapeutics."
"9510237","SUMMARY  Type IV secretion systems (TFSS) are present in many different species of bacteria and play important roles both in horizontal gene transfer and in the virulence properties of several pathogens. When bacteria infect host cells, TFSS translocate proteins called ?effectors? to the target cell. The effector proteins can exert a wide variety of cell biological and biochemical changes on the host that are beneficial for the infecting pathogen. Although considerable effort has been directed at understanding the functions of many TFSS effectors, much less attention has been directed at detailed studies of the TFSS. Detailed genetic analysis of TFSS however has not been carried out in any systematic way. Genetic analysis has the potential to provide important functional information that will not come from structural studies alone. The information provided by genetic analysis will contribute to a better understanding of TFSS in several ways. The identification of permissive and non-permissive sites in TFSS components will facilitate the eventual use of biochemical tools that can be tailored to provide information about protein-protein interactions and accessibility to different types of functional probes. Identification of mutant alleles with conditional or partial phenotypes will also provide important information about the functional roles of TFSS components. We will carry out a systematic, detailed mutational analysis of permissive and non-permissive sites in the Dot/Icm TFSS components DotL, DotH< DotG, and DotE of Legionella pneumophila. This TFSS is the major virulence determinant of L. pneumophila and is capable of both effector translocation to host cells and bacterial conjugation. We will use the Mu-based Entranceposon? method to introduce 15 bp insertions (ent) into the dot/icm genes. We will screen the mutants for the ability to survive grazing by Acanthamoeba castellanii, a typical L. pneumophila host. Wild-type L. pneumophila grows within and kills A. castellanii but dot/icm Legionella mutants are digested and killed by the amoebae. Once permissive sites have been determined in the dot/icm genes, we will introduce recognition sites for TEV protease. This protease specifically recognizes a heptamer sequence that is otherwise absent in Legionella. We will study the effects of cleaving the Dot/Icm proteins that contain the TEV recognition site (TevS) in vivo under different conditions. We will also collaborate with a lab that can visualize the TFSS with Cryo-EM tomography. TEV-cleaved TFSS complexes will be examined by Cryo-EM tomography to identify the locations of specific components within the complex. This approach will allow us to determine if individual Dot/Icm components are required during translocation or if they are required for assembly of a functional TFSS but dispensable for its activity."
"9440207","7. Project Summary/Abstract A DNA double strand break (DSB) which constitutes severing of a chromosome into two parts is one of the most lethal types of DNA damage because it can lead to loss of genetic information, or other forms of chromosomal rearrangements. DSBs can occur spontaneously mainly during DNA replication or be caused by external DNA damaging agents. One mechanism of DSB repair is via error-free homologous recombination (HR), a process in which missing genetic information resulting from the break is copied from another similar undamaged chromosomal region. Although HR has been studied extensively, a complete understanding of the mechanisms that govern this process has remained elusive. In recent years, multiple recombination pathways have been identified that may produce gene conversions, deletions, translocations or duplications. Analyzing the genetic requirements for all these recombination outcomes could be a daunting task. Most of the many pathways of repair have been studied independently and to our knowledge a way of simultaneously studding the contributions of all the repair pathways has not been possible. Here we propose the development of a novel assay that can simultaneously study the contribution of most recombination pathways through a simple genetic screen. We then intend to use this assay to assess the function of two chromatin remodeling genes in homologous recombination. We believe that this assay will be of tremendous interest in the field of double strand break repair and will greatly enhance our understanding of DNA damage repair. !"
"9408648","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure and contributes to over 350,000 deaths annually in the United States. Although hypertension is thought to be one of the most modifiable contributors to cardiovascular disease, our incomplete knowledge of the etiology of this complex disease trait has hindered our ability to therapeutically control blood pressure in a diverse population of affected patients. Recent studies in pre-clinical models indicate that the small GTPase protein, RhoA, regulates blood pressure by stimulating the contractility of smooth muscle cells (SMC) within resistance vessels. Although studies from our lab and others have shown that RhoA activity is regulated by cellular proteins that control its on/off state, the precise signaling mechanisms that control its activity in blood vessels are largely unknown. We have recently demonstrated that the Rho-specific GTPase activating protein, GRAF3, is highly and selectively expressed in SMC in mice and humans and inhibits RhoA-dependent contractility in this cell-type. Moreover, our data indicate that GRAF3's ability to limit RhoA activity in SMC is required for the maintenance of normal blood pressure and provide a novel mechanism for the blood pressure (BP) associated locus within the GRAF3 gene that was recently identified by Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Interestingly, the BP- associated locus maps to the 80Kb first intron of the GRAF3 gene strongly suggesting that its effects on BP are mediated by alterations in GRAF3 expression. Indeed, the minor GRAF3 allele that decreases blood pressure is significantly associated with increased GRAF3 mRNA levels in human tibial artery samples. Taking advantage of our considerable expertise on the regulation of SMC-specific gene expression, we have already identified regulatory elements within the hypertensive locus that exhibit SMC-selective transcriptional activity and have shown that a minor allele variation within one of these elements significantly increased its transcriptional activity. The goal of this multi-PI, multidisciplinary proposal is to further examine the role of GRAF3 in the pathogenesis of human hypertension. In aim 1 we will use our unique GRAF3-deficient mouse lines in combination with several well-characterized hypertensive models to determine the extent to which changes in vessel tone contribute to the development of hypertension and hypertension-induced cardiovascular disease. The goal of Aim2 is to identify the regulatory elements and transcription factors that drive SMC-specific GRAF3 expression and to identify the SNPs that alter the activities of GRAF3 regulatory elements. The goal of Aim3 is to test whether GRAF3 genotype correlates with GRAF3 levels and hypertension in patient populations. To this end, we have established collaborations with several clinical cardiovascular research teams at the University of North Carolina. We will continue to correlate genetic variations within the GARF3 gene with GRAF3 expression and a number of cardiovascular end-points including vascular stiffness and intermediate disease outcomes. The completion of these aims will add significantly to our understanding of the development and pathophysiologic consequences of hypertension and to novel and perhaps individualized approaches to the treatment of this prevalent and debilitating disease."

Application of these techniques to intermediate states that are trapped by freeze-quench and cryoreduction methods, and are isotopically labeled by outstanding teams of collaborating chemists and biologists, can completely characterize the active-site environment of a metal ion at every stage of an enzyme's catalytic cycle. As augmented by novel kinetic protocols we have developed, these studies reveal in precise details the function of critical metal centers, not only in isolate enzymes but in living cells as well. Dramatic progress during our current grant period has inspired multiple specific aims: (i) Small-molecule activation by metalloenzymes, including Dioxygen-activation by Heme Monooxygenases and Dinitrogen Reduction by Nitrogenase; (ii) Biomimetic Mo and Fe Complexes as Models for Nitrogenase Intermediates and Paradigms for the Jahn-Taller Effect in trigonal symmetry; (iii) Radical Reactions in Metalloenzymes -The Radical SAM Superfamily; (iv) in vivo Speciation of Mn(II) - Protection from Oxidative Stress, Mechanisms of Toxicity, Probe of Physiology; (v) ATPase Co(II)/Mn(II) Transporters; (vi) ENDOR Methodology Development - Hyperfine Signs, Electron-Nuclear-Electron Triple Resonance, Q-band Resonator Development; (vii) Extending the Biological Applications of ENDOR Techniques. Many of these aims reflect longstanding efforts, while projects associated with transition-metal homeostasis that emerged this period (Mn(II) speciation, and Mn(II)/Co(II) transport) reflect a commitment to opening new areas, as explicitly expressed in the final Aim."
"9462276","Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound, is the major active constituent isolated from the rhizome of turmeric (curcuma longa Linn), a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae). Curcumin is a potent anti- inflammatory molecule that may interact with multiple molecular targets involved in inflammatory pathways. It has been suggested that curcumin could have therapeutic potential to treat inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, curcumin exhibits poor bioavailability because of its limited aqueous solubility, susceptibility to photo degradation, chemical instability, rapid metabolism, and short half- life. Efforts to develop new curcumin-based therapeutic approaches against IBD must overcome these challenges intrinsic to the properties of the curcumin molecule. My sponsor?s laboratory and other groups have recently demonstrated that artificially synthesized nanoparticles may be used to enhance the biological effects of incorporated drugs by protecting these drugs, including curcumin, from enzymatic degradation, providing controlled release and limiting nonspecific uptake by off-target tissues. However, nanoparticles synthesized to date have two major limitations: i) the requirement that each constituent of the synthesized nanoparticle be examined for potential in vivo toxicity before clinical application, and ii) their limited production scale. The use of nanoparticles derived from natural sources may overcome these limitations of synthetic nanoparticles. Here, I provide preliminary data on the characterization and efficient colon-targeting of nanoparticles derived from edible turmeric. In addition, I have demonstrated that a specific population of turmeric-derived nanoparticles (TDNPs), namely TDNP2, contains a high concentration of curcumin that is protected from degradation by the nanoparticle. In addition, I have demonstrated that orally administered TDNP2s target the colon and reduce acute intestinal inflammation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that TDNP2s, naturally loaded with curcumin, may be a novel treatment for IBD. In Aim 1, I will examine the treatment efficacy of TDNP2s in several distinct and well-established mouse models of IBD, including dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated and IL10-/- and T/RAG-/- mice. I will also investigate intestinal cellular targets of TDNP2s and resulting intestinal cellular responses. In Aim 2, I will use knockout (KO) and knock-in (KI) strategies to investigate whether curcumin is responsible for the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin-loaded TDNP2s. This study represents proof of principle of a novel, natural, nontoxic delivery system that targets the inflamed intestinal mucosa and may easily be developed for large-scale production aimed at the treatment of IBD."
"9444721","Project Summary/Abstract The negative consequences of pediatric bipolar disorder (BP) are well documented, but the course, outcome, and prognostic factors of BP as youth transit into adulthood remain unknown. To answer these questions, the Predicting Adult Outcomes in BP Youth (PROBY), a multisite study (University of Pittsburgh, PI: B.Birmaher; Brown University, PIs: M.Keller/S.Yen; UCLA, PI: M.Strober), proposes: 1) to extend the prospective follow-up of the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth (COBY) cohort into adulthood, and 2) to use COBY data to build risk calculators to predict short-(2 years), intermediate-(5 years), and long-term (10 years) personalized mood course/outcome that capture transitions from adolescence through adulthood. We will study five key domains relevant for BP: 1) course of mood and non-mood disorders; 2) psychosocial functioning; 3) suicidality; 4) SUD; and 5) cognitive functioning. Risk calculation is an analytic approach that instead of group prediction, yields individualized estimates of risk for a specified event in a given patient, based on the presence of multiple risk factors. The risk calculators proposed in PROBY will have a true population impact by predicting BP outcomes, similar to those used in cardiovascular disease and cancer, but rarely applied in psychiatric disorders. The risk calculators will include well-established variables, in order to allow replication and clinical utility. Also, these variables are easily ascertained in clinical settings and are part of standard practice and thus, will be widely disseminable, and hold promise for utility in daily clinical practice. For example, results may be used to: counsel patients/families about long-term prognosis; individualize treatment by identifying patients likely to require prolonged treatments and those for whom medications may be reduced with minimal risk; and inform early intervention/prevention and clinical/biological research. To pursue the proposed study, 343 COBY subjects (BP-I=72.3%, BP-II=14.6%, BP-NOS=13.1%, mean age 26.3 (18.7?33.7), 47% female, 82% Caucasian, and on average, middle class), will have 2 additional clinical assessments over the five years of study. These subjects represent 77% of the original sample (n=446) enrolled between 2000 and 2006 at the three study sites. PROBY will continue to prospectively collect data on categorical and dimensional psychopathology, protective factors, psychosocial functioning (e.g., relationships, work, academics), cognitive functioning, inflammatory markers, cardiometabolic conditions, exposure to stressful/traumatic life events, and treatment (e.g., medication dosages, barriers). With 5 additional years of prospective observation, the mean age of the sample will be 31.3 years old (23.7?38.7). Thus, PROBY will be the first study with adequate sample size to answer questions about what happens to BP youth when they grow up. Furthermore, PROBY will be the first study to build risk calculators to predict outcome in key domains relevant for BP and validate these results using an independent adult BP sample (n=427) from the Collaborative Depression Study (CDS; R01 MH025416). These risk calculators have the potential to widely transform clinical care of BP."
"9397974","Project Summary Impaired vascular repair/angiogenesis is a major clinical problem in aged patients that often leads to ischemic peripheral artery and cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have focused on strategies to improve aged cells? angiogenesis capability and subsequent tissue repair. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators of vascular function. We propose that altered expression of miRNAs in hind limbs during aging contributes to the age-dependent decline in vascular function. Among the numerous miRNAs, miR-34a has shown promise as a biomarker for organ aging. It correlates with impaired function of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells from patients with cardiovascular disease. Remarkably, the mechanism underlying miRNAs? regulation of angiogenesis, especially in aging, is not completely understood. Our central hypothesis is that the miR-34a retards angiogenesis in aging by directly inhibiting the GCH1/BH4 pathway resulting in excessive oxidative stress, which accelerates senescence, activates inflammasome, and suppresses mitophagy. Remarkably, little information exists on miRNAs regulation of angiogenesis, especially under aging. This hypothesis was formulated after a careful analysis of published work in the field and the generation of some key preliminary data in our laboratory. We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish our objective by pursuing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will establish the critical role of miR-34a in regulation of angiogenesis in aging. Our working hypothesis is that miR-34a inhibits angiogenesis in aging via impairing endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) functions. In Aim 2, we will delineate the effect of the GCH 1/BH4 pathway on miR-34a induced EPC dysfunction in aging. We hypothesize that that miR-34a retards EPC functions in aging by directly inhibiting the GCH1/BH4 pathway, which results in excessive oxidative stress that decreases telomerase activity and accelerates senescence via suppressing Silent Information Regulator 1 (SIRT1). In Aim 3, we will determine how miR-34a affects mitophagy and inflammasome activation in aging after hind limb ischemia. Deficiency of GCH1/BH4 results in elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, which may activate inflammasome, and thus inhibit mitophagy and accelerate the aging process. We hypothesize that miR-34a inhibits mitophagy in aging via Nlrp3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome activation, which can be triggered by accumulation of mitochondrial superoxide. The major significance of this study is that it will determine how miRNAs regulate angiogenic functions during aging. Once such knowledge is gained, it is possible that new modalities may be developed to therapeutically rescue impaired angiogenesis in the growing number of aging patients today."
"9447993","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its associated, specific tropomyosin related kinase B (TrkB) receptor modulates basal myocardial function and low circulating BDNF levels correlate with worsening of symptoms in heart failure (HF) subjects. Deleting BDNF in myocytes leads to prominent LV dilation at baseline, but basal and stress-stimulated left ventricle (LV) function was never tested in cBDNF-/- mice. Our pilot data suggest that left ventricles from human and experimental HF subjects are massively BDNF depleted. Despite this experimental and clinical evidence, cardiac BDNF/TrkB remains largely understudied. The long-term goal is to determine factors accounting for loss in BDNF/TrkB signal in failing hearts, and mechanisms whereby re- introducing BDNF via TrkB stimulation in BDNF-depleted failing hearts affords protection against ischemic and non-ischemic stress. Here we advance the following three novel hypotheses: 1) that myocardial BDNF generation prevents chronic cardiac decompensation in infarcted hearts, and proper ?AR activity is involved in this generation; 2) that direct S1PRs stimulation enhances myocardial BDNF production, preventing LV decompensation in infarcted mice, and that selective ?1AR-blockers rescue ?3AR down-regulation in post-MI hearts, increasing myocardial BDNF levels via ?3-AR/S1PRs signal; 3) that cardiac TrkB stimulation rescues ?-AR sensitivity and improves decompensation in a dog model of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. The rationale for the proposal is that understanding how loss in BDNF/TrkB signal contributes to myocardial adaptation to ischemic or non-ischemic cardiac stress will advance efforts to therapeutically harness this capacity for clinical relevant conditions associated to loss of cardiomyocytes due to ischemic or non-ischemic cardiac diseases. The central hypotheses will be tested in three integrated Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if deleting myocardial BDNF worsens outcome in mice with myocardial infarction, and to test whether TrkB agonists rescues BDNF expression and ?-AR sensitivity in infarcted hearts, the latter by inhibited GRK2, the major kinase liable for cardiac ?-AR desensitization. In Aim 2, we will test if direct ?3-AR or S1PRs stimulation enhances myocardial BDNF content to protect the myocardium against myocardial infarction; In Aim 3, we will test whether the chronic infusion of TrkB agonists rescues LV function in dogs with tachypacing-induced HF via improved myocardial efficiency and restored ?-AR sensitivity. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to foster our understanding of a novel compensatory mechanism, BDNF/TrkB signal that can enable the heart to preserve functional integrity and energetic efficiency in myocardial cells under condition of ischemic or non-ischemic stress, and to determine whether TrkB agonists merit further consideration for clinical testing in HF."
"9573161","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1993, the Washington Metropolitan WIHS (WMW) Consortium has enrolled and retained a representative community cohort of HIV-infected and uninfected women with the purpose of supporting NIAID in understanding the current epidemiology of HIV, risk behaviors, disease progression, treatment uptake and outcomes, and related co-morbidities. The early cohort of infected women is aging, and the effects of age and menopausal status on disease outcomes and co-morbidities is yet to be elucidated. The WMW has joined with centers around the country and with sites across metropolitan Washington, DC to address these issues. This is particularly pertinent as Washington, DC has the highest prevalence of HIV of any urban center in the U.S. and the WMW has enrolled and retained a cohort that represents women both ethnically and psychosocially. The WMW has successfully participated in all elements of the WIHS protocol and has actively supported the infrastructure of the national WIHS. WMW investigators have participated in all of the major WIHS scientific initiatives. Additionally, with its rich data baseand local and national specimen repository, the WMW has supported local and national initiatives designed to understand the pathophysiology underlying co-morbidities. The WMW proposes to continue this work and to expand its research portfolio by continuing its strong collaborative relationship with the national WIHS in the area of protocol development, implementation, sub study participation, and identification of new initiatives. Additionally, for the next cycle of funing we have proposed new initiatives that include a telephone-based intervention for depression that will positively impact adherence and health behaviors with the goal of reducing community viral load. This intervention can easily be implemented in the larger DC community. We are expanding our local initiatives on HIV and HCV associated liver disease by engaging a team of researchers in exploring the host response, epigenetic factors, and protein glycosylation in liver disease and cancer. We will also continue and expand our investigations in organ specific morbidities associated with long-term survival in an aging population with the goal of reducing or preventing morbidity in the areas of vascular health, neurocognitive decline, and the vaginal immunologic response in aging. We will accomplish this by engaging with national and local investigators with proven expertise in these areas to further leverage the NIH investment in this important cohort of women. This will allow us to better define the status of women with HIV and bring to fruition the goals of an AIDS free generation and effective and sustainable treatment for those already infected."
"9410529","Abstract  Defects in cardiac excitability are the basis for human arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death, a leading cause of mortality in developed countries. Unfortunately, arguably the last major ?game-changing? breakthroughs in electrical cardiomyocyte biology and cardiac signaling for human health were the beta- blocker (discovered in the 1950s) and `ACE' inhibitor (in the 1970s). On the other hand, therapeutic agents to treat disorders of cardiac excitation (arrhythmias) are plagued by limited efficacy and even off-target pro- arrhythmia. Despite a wealth of negative clinical data, excitable cell researchers have largely remained focused on the same paradigm - pharmacological therapies targeting cardiac ion channels. We contend that improved therapies will only arise through a more sophisticated, working understanding of interactions between structural proteins (such as ankyrins), electrical proteins (ion channels, pumps & exchangers) and signaling systems (kinases, phosphatases, oxidases).  Our studies discovered that ankyrin and spectrin proteins, previously considered static membrane adapters, play dynamic roles in ion channel, transporter, and signaling protein targeting in ventricular cardiomyocytes. Further, we have learned that these proteins serve as critical central membrane nodes to regulate normal signaling in heart. Finally, and most importantly, we have learned that dysfunction in these pathways results in potentially fatal forms of both congenital and acquired ventricular arrhythmia.  Our long-term goal is to discover novel integrated mechanisms for regulating cardiovascular cell excitability and signaling. We have used the informative case of ankyrins and spectrins as a tractable starting point, but propose to rapidly extend these studies to new systems with diverse interacting structure-electrical- signaling systems. Our laboratory has taken an active lead in the identification of new cellular pathways for regulation of cellular excitability based on human clinical, tissue, and genetic data. In addition, we have pushed innovation in the field through the use of physiologically-relevant model systems to study the mechanisms underlying electrical signaling in the complex vertebrate cardiomyocyte. This approach has ultimately culminated in an ability to not only diagnose new forms of potentially fatal arrhythmia, but to design effective patient-selective therapies for these diseases. If successful in obtaining funding from the NHLBI Outstanding Investigator Award, we will continue to pursue scientific studies with the potential to create new, cell-specific insights for improved understanding of cardiac excitability with direct relevance for congenital and acquired human disease."
"9402651","ABSTRACT Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the most common drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia and can have devastating consequences for an affected patient. Antibodies that recognize the platelet alpha- granule protein, platelet factor 4 (PF4), in a complex with heparin (?HIT antibodies?) are central to HIT pathogenesis. The kinetics of HIT antibody production, characterized by rapid onset and apparent lack of immunologic memory, suggest T-cell independence, but IgG antibodies typical of HIT argue for T cell involvement. These ambiguous features of the HIT antibody response have confounded efforts to characterize HIT immune- pathogenesis. There are three subsets of mature B cells, follicular (FO), marginal zone (MZ) and B1 B cells. Each subset has a distinct role in the humoral immune response and is regulated differently. Signals generated through the B cell receptor (BCR) are required for B cell development, function and establishment of self-tolerance and dysregulation of BCR signaling can lead to autoimmunity. In previous studies under this grant, we showed in a mouse model that MZ B cells play a critical role in HIT antibody production, that breakdown of immunologic tolerance appears to be involved in HIT antibody production in mice and humans, and that T helper cells control heparin-induced production of HIT antibodies in mice. We also identified important signaling molecules and pathways that are critical for BCR-mediated B-cell function and tolerance. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PF4/heparin-specific B cells originate from the distinct MZ B cell subset in human HIT patients and that activation and proliferation of pathogenic B cells is controlled by T cells and the major tolerance mechanism, anergy. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed. Specifically, we will 1) define the cellular source and molecular properties of anti-PF4/heparin antibodies in human HIT, 2) investigate mechanisms by which T cells help PF4/heparin-specific MZ B cells, and 3) characterize molecular mechanism(s) that regulate PF4/heparin antibody production. Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for HIT antibody production will provide new clues to the pathogenesis of HIT, suggest novel tools for HIT diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment and may contribute to the understanding of other autoimmune diseases relevant to transfusion medicine."
"9464656","Abstract The overall goal of this project is to conduct preclinical studies on Novo29, our newly-discovered bactericidal compound. As drug-resistance continues to spread, new classes of antibiotics are needed to combat infections by pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). Novo29 is a novel class of peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitor with favorable drug properties. It shows excellent activity against Gram-positive pathogens, has not shown resistance to date, and is well tolerated in mice.  Interestingly, Novo29 shares structural features with teixobactin, another new class of antibiotic that we discovered in 2015. Teixobactin, which is currently in development, kills bacteria by binding to two bacterial cell wall precursors (lipid II and lipid III), and no resistance to the compound has been shown. Part of this grant will examine whether Novo29 works through the same mechanism as teixobactin. Although structurally similar, Novo29 may offer an advantage over teixobactin as it is a smaller compound (902D compared to 1242D), and does not gelate in serum, which has narrowed teixobactin?s safety window.  In Aim 1, Novo29 will be tested against an expanded panel of important pathogens, including contemporary clinical isolates. Time-kill profiles and expanded resistance studies effects will be studied in relevant pathogens. In addition, we will determine protein binding and microsomal stability of Novo29. In Aim 2, Novo29 will be tested for binding to the lipid II and lipid II precursors. If Novo29 does not bind to these compounds, we will analyze the accumulation of peptidoglycan nucleotide precursors and perform muropeptide analysis of Novo29-treated cells to identify the target. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct pharmacokinetic studies in mice that will inform the design of an efficacy study in a mouse thigh infection model using MRSA.  The vast majority of antibiotics entering the market over the last several decades are simply incremental modifications of known structures. As resistance to common scaffolds is a major health concern, our discovery of yet another antibacterial compound with novel structure and important mode of action meets a critical, unmet goal in antibiotic drug discovery. In this project, Novo29 will advance through early preclinical studies in preparation for Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies."
"9425925","The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2."
"9469753","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The diagnosis of a brain tumor (i.e., glioma) and its treatment tends to be difficult for not only patients but also their families. As patients with brain tumors face a poor prognosis and high symptom burden, family members play a vital role in offering ongoing emotional support and physical care. Although family caregivers want to provide quality care to their loved one, caring for a loved one with brain cancer is emotionally and physically taxing, and caregivers report high prevalence rates of psychological distress, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, which may undermine the quality of care they are able to provide to the patient. Consequently, there is a high need to develop supportive care programs that teach caregivers effective self-care behaviors and skills to manage their own symptoms. Mind-body interventions (e.g., yoga, meditation, tai chi) have been shown to improve the QOL of cancer patients, but little is known whether these types of interventions are feasible and efficacious in improving caregiver burden. Moreover, there is reason to believe that delivering a supportive care intervention to both caregivers and patients together may be advantageous regarding study feasibility as well as treatment efficacy. Thus, the proposed investigation will examine the role of a yoga program in managing QOL in caregiver-patient dyads. Dyads will be randomly assigned to either a caregiver-only yoga, a caregiver-patient dyadic yoga or a waitlist control group. Prior to randomization, caregivers and patients will complete standard QOL and symptom self-report measures. Caregiver and patient healthcare utilization data will also be collected. Feasibility data will be documented (e.g., consent, attrition, adherence) throughout. Participants in the yoga groups will receive 15 practice sessions (45 min each). We will incorporate the interventions into patients' radiation treatment (RT) plans as the yoga programs may be especially useful at this time to buffer symptom burden that ensues. These data allow us to address two fundamental questions: 1) is it feasible to implement a randomized controlled trial of a caregiver and dyadic yoga intervention involving caregivers and brain tumor patients undergoing radiotherapy? And, 2) is there preliminary evidence of treatment efficacy in regard to QOL outcomes of a dyadic versus caregiver-only intervention compared to a waitlist control group? We will use these data to determine if a future, larger study is warranted. This project represents a major step towards managing QOL in families coping with a life threatening disease."
"9412754","Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans, and arthritis is the most common cause. Existing treatments for chronic arthritic pain are only mildly effective, and risks of medications used to treat pain are numerous and continue to be discovered. Treatment of chronic is a high priority research area for VA CSR&D. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that is FDA approved in an oral daily dose of 50 mg to prevent recidivism in alcoholics. At much lower doses of 4 ? 4.5 mg daily, however, it has been shown in small, blinded, randomized trials to improve pain in fibromyalgia, gastrointestinal symptoms in Crohn?s disease, and quality of life in multiple sclerosis. The only other published data are case reports in complex regional pain syndrome, low back pain, and scleroderma. However, advocacy of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) by internet-based MDs and patients is high, and since LDN can be prescribed off-label, its use greatly exceeds what is justified by evidence. The drug can be prescribed only via compounding pharmacies, so its use costs a patient ~$40/month. Among the many unproven treatments that are widely used, LDN is of particular interest because results of surveys of patients are particularly impressive, because it is quite safe, and because its benefit is plausible pharmacologically. There is evidence both for modulation of central pain-processing pathways and for down- regulation of inflammatory pathways in microglia. Considering the diversity of conditions proposed to benefit from LDN and the unequivocal need for better approaches to pain relief in chronic conditions, high-quality clinical trials are needed in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. This small but placebo- controlled study, powered to detect an effect size as small as that seen with NSAIDs or the most beneficial non-pharmacologic approaches, is proposed as a prerequisite for considering a pivotal trial through the VA Cooperative Studies Program. The proposed study is a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial in adults with osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis and persistent pain. Sixty patients will be enrolled for 12 weeks, during which they will receive LDN for 8 weeks and placebo for 4 weeks. Widely accepted patient-reported outcome measures will be used. The co-primary endpoints are reduction in pain severity or pain?s interference with function during 8 weeks of LDN compared to 4 weeks placebo, using the Brief Pain Inventory. Other patient- reported data will be used both as secondary outcomes and as covariates in analyzing determinants of response to treatment. Key inclusion criteria include diagnosis of OA or IA and pain rated at least 4 on a scale of 0-10, a widely accepted criterion. Key exclusion criteria, chosen conservatively for the purposes of safety, include opioid use or severe liver, kidney, or psychiatric disease. OA, IA, and inadequate control of pain are sufficiently common that the study can be completed in two years at a single center."
"9398132","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant portions of eukaryotic genomes, including the Y chromosome, are heterochromatic, made up largely of repetitive sequences and possessing a distinctive chromatin structure associated with gene silencing. Heterochromatic regions have a high repeat content and are characterized by specific histone modifications, but the primary sequence elements that define specific chromosomal domains as preferred sites of heterochromatin assembly are not well understood. Recent studies suggest that small RNAs -- possibly derived from transposable elements (TEs) -- contribute to heterochromatin targeting. The recently formed neo-Y chromosomes of Drosophila albomicans and D. miranda are in the process of evolving altered chromatin structure: On the D. miranda neo-Y - which was formed about 1 MY ago - large segments have already acquired a heterochromatic appearance and TEs show a striking accumulation. About half of the neo-Y-loci have become non-functional, and most genes (<80%) are down-regulated from the neo-Y. This is supporting a link between heterochromatin formation and repetitive DNA, and its repressive effect on gene expression. The much younger D. albomicans neo-Y (<0.1 MY old) is mostly euchromatic, and most genes are functional on the neo-Y (<2% pseudogenes). However, almost 30% of neo-Y genes are down-regulated and in situ hybridization experiments reveal some early signs of accumulation of heterochromatin on the neo-Y of D. albomicans. D. miranda and D. albomicans therefore provide unique systems to study the mechanisms and evolution of heterochromatin formation in action using evolutionary approaches. Using a combination of comparative sequence analysis, gene expression studies, small RNA profiling and ChIP-seq experiments to map histone modifications associated with heterochromatin and genome interaction maps, we will address the following questions: What are the primary sequence elements used for targeting heterochromatin? Are small RNAs involved in heterochromatin targeting? What is the influence of heterochromatin formation on levels of gene expression? How far does heterochromatin spread in cis or in 3D? Is a high repeat content necessary for spreading of heterochromatin? Have chromatin boundary elements evolved on the neo-Y to limit spreading, and what is their molecular nature? Are histone modifications associated with active transcription counteracting the spread of heterochromatin? Can we identify other DNA sequence elements functioning as boundary elements on the neo-Y? Are certain categories of genes more likely to be heterochromatic? It will allow us to study the molecular basis of heterochromatin and how it evolves."

"9395245","Communication behaviors, including information seeking, information giving, and responding to emotions, can be measured within in-person interpersonal health communication between Veterans and healthcare providers. Investigators have developed reliable coding schemas to extract communication behaviors from audiotapes of clinical encounters. Using these schemas, including the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), patterns of communication behaviors have been positively associated with patient satisfaction, trust in providers, and positive changes in Veteran self-management (e.g., medication adherence). Recently, RIAS has been adapted for use with telehealth and asynchronous written communication (like email). With the advent of Secure Messaging, VA has a new opportunity to directly measure communication behaviors written into these messages. Over the past five years, our team has demonstrated that communication behaviors are present in Secure Messages and can reliably be extracted using the same coding schemas validated for in-person interpersonal exchanges. In this project, we propose to advance knowledge and methods related to communication behaviors measurable through asynchronous Secure Messages. We propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Mine communication behaviors. Using a national corpus of Secure Messages, we will develop a sentence classification system incorporating machine learning techniques to detect communication in Secure Message responses from primary care doctors and clinical staff. Specific Aim 2: Define communication behavior indicators (CBIs) that represent clinically meaningful measures of Secure Message communication patterns between Veterans and Clinical Teams, then test the association of CBIs with measures of Veteran Experience (2.a) and Patient-reported behavior (2.b), medication adherence. We will identify and survey a sample of Veterans (CASES) with high CBI rates (top tertile) and a matched set of (CONTROLS) with low rates (bottom tertile). Aim 2.a Veteran experience with Secure Messaging and CBIs: We hypothesize (H1) that CASES (Veterans with high rates of communication behaviors (CBIs)) will rate the experience with physician communication through Secure Messaging more positively than CONTROL Veterans. Aim 2.b. Veteran-reported medication adherence: In prior studies of in-person communication, patterns of communication behaviors are strongly associated with measures of medication adherence. In our survey, we will measure patient-reported medication adherence and assess the association of adherence reports with secure messaging CBIs. We hypothesize (H2) that CASES will have better self-reported medication adherence, compared with CONTROLS. Specific Aim 3: Understand experiences of providers with high rates of CBIs in messages. A high priority for the VA Under Secretary for Health is to collect and disseminate best practices in VA. In Aim 3, we will collect best practices from physicians (N = 30) with high rates of these positive communication behaviors from Secure Messages, and a comparison sample of 30 with low rates of CBIs. 1"
"9304566","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In addition to their well-known deficits in language learning, young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show abnormal visual preferences for perceptually salient features of the environment (e.g., complex geometric patterns). Recent studies have revealed an association between these two aspects of the ASD phenotype, leading to the provocative hypothesis that abnormal visual preferences have cascading negative effects on language development. However, we do not yet know how abnormal visual preferences impact language in children with ASD, or which children are most vulnerable to these effects. In the absence of such knowledge, we have an incomplete understanding of why these children struggle to learn language and how to alleviate their difficulties. The long-term goal is to identify the developmental mechanisms that underlie language-learning deficits in children with ASD. The overall objective of the proposed project is to determine how abnormal visual preferences impact familiar word processing and novel word learning, and to identify the children who are most severely affected. The central hypothesis is that abnormally strong visual preferences for perceptual salience will disproportionately disrupt word processing and word learning in children with ASD, and that the amount of disruption will correlate with key behavioral characteristics. The rationale is that determining how abnormal visual preferences impact word processing and word learning will help us understand why children with ASD have difficulty learning language, thereby yielding valuable theoretical and clinical advances. Guided by strong preliminary data, the proposed project will investigate three specific aims: 1) To assess the impact of competing perceptual salience on familiar word processing in children with ASD and age-matched, typically developing children; 2) To assess the impact of competing perceptual salience on novel word learning in children with ASD and age-matched, typically developing children; and 3) To identify behavioral characteristics that correlate with the amount of disruption in word processing and word learning created by competing perceptual salience. These aims will be addressed using eye-gaze methodology, an approach that the PI has used extensively and has shown to be feasible with the target populations. Novel adaptations of two well-established eye-gaze tasks will assess the impact of competing perceptual salience on familiar word processing (Aim 1) and novel word learning (Aim 2). Growth curve analyses will measure the amount of disruption experienced by individual children, as well as the contributions of key behavioral characteristics (e.g., receptive vocabulary; Aim 3). The proposed project is innovative because it adopts a novel methodological approach and integrative theoretical framework that maximize its potential to exert a substantial and lasting impact on the field. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance theories of autism and language acquisition and enable the development of novel treatment strategies that limit detrimental effects of competing perceptual salience."
"9418507","Project Summary The identification of cancer metastases to the bony vertebral column obligates the treating clinician to make a surgical decision. If the spine is deemed unstable and at risk for fracture, then the patient will undergo a major spinal operation, and will often spend much of their remaining life recuperating from it. Vertebral body metastasis is sometimes treated with corpectomy of the affected vertebral body and adjacent intervertebral discs, creating a non-contained skeletal defect needing anterior column spinal reconstruction and posterior instrumentation. Reconstructive techniques requiring both an anterior surgical exposure (reconstruction of affected vertebra) and a posterior exposure (instrumentation of the spine) are quite invasive for these patients, while a posterior-only surgical approach requires small implants for anterior spinal column reconstruction. Intervertebral expandable titanium cages, although effective for this reconstruction, are expensive, and can represent the dominant cost for the reconstructive spinal procedure. In addition, they are often too large to insert safely from the posterior surgical approach. Thus, a critical need exists to provide these frail patients with a lower surgical burden while at the same time improving their quality of life. This research proposal aims to address a critical issue involved in the care of patients with metastatic spine defects. The goals of this proposal are to develop a novel expandable biomaterial system that can be delivered via a posterior-only surgical approach, would provide rigidity and stability to the spine, and would be much more cost effective than current expandable metal cages"
"9475097","?     Description: Provide a brief description of the center and its focus.          This is a CoE renewal application for the third grant period of the Advanced Platform Technology Center of Excellence from the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center. The PI is Ron Triolo, a very experienced and well-funded investigator with awards from NIH (2), VA RR&D (2) and DOD (2) in addition to the current version of the Center. The proposed CoE is an infrastructure for translation and translational research in four main areas: Prosthetics/Orthotics Health Monitoring/Maintenance, Neural Interfacing and emerging Enabling Technologies. The CoE will predominantly fund the staff and some investigators, with support for research mainly occurring through leveraging grant and a modest pilot program. In each of these areas the CoE will work to move individual projects through the translational spectrum from basic science to proof of concept in animals to in vivo testing to in humans to clinical trials. As a result progres is made toward problems of great importance to the RR&D mission. There is great synergy in the local environment with the FES CoE, Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. The CoE investigators are leaders in the different research areas with more than $7 million in active funding for the current year. There is particular strength in prosthetics and neural interfacing. If funded, it is expected that a number of projects and technologies would be translated (or moved one step further along the translational continuum). The projects presented (the majority already funded by current active funding) are clearly feasible and well thought out. The previous funding cycle was exceptionally successful with CoE investigators receiving more the $58 million in external funding and the center becoming home to two PECASE awardees, six CDA recipients and two Senior Research Career Scientists as well as other senior investigators responsible for almost 250 publications, more than 330 presentations, 105 outreach and media events, and over 100 disclosures, 75 patent applications and licenses.           Evaluation:           Significance and Impact of Prior Work:     The CoE has been incredibly productive (metrics given above) and has established a great working model, which has led to a number of promising translational research advances such as:     * Determining the biocompatibility of novel nanocomposite material in rat cortex and developing new microfabrication techniques to process it into functional cortical recording probes, thus moving the project from proof-of-concept to initial pre-clinical testing.      * Refining prototypes of wireless implanted bladder pressure monitor and modular surface electrotherapy system to test in vertebrate animals to prepare them for transition to first-in-man clinical feasibility trials     * Filed a Device Master File for the FINE (flat interface nerve electrode), which was accepted by the FDA and referenced in two successful IDEs, enabling chronic human implantation for natural sensation to upper limb amputees and facilitate standing and stepping after paralysis. The devices have now been functioning without adverse event in amputees for more than two years.          There are numerous additional examples of high impact research at various levels along the translational research continuum.           Strength of Proposed Research Focus:      The proposed work is highly relevant to the veteran population and it is certain that it will produce much new and useful information. The research focus areas have been defined very clearly and the high priority projects in each are detailed in such a manner that it seems very clear that the CoE will be able to execute the research projects successfully. There is much that will be contributed to the VA RR&D portfolio. One potential weakness is that several of the projects will contribute more to veteran health care than to rehabilitation practice as they are more general medical solutions. That being said, they are high impact projects that are able to use the developed infrastructure so this is at most a minor concern.           Effectiveness of Operating Plan:      This is a great strength of the proposal. The infrastructure that they are using has been proven to work. CoE funds support an outstanding professional support staff. They fund all or part of the following: regulatory affairs specialist, quality assurance specialist, engineering manager, director of external affairs and industrial relations, director of internal operations, information  technology specialist, and various engineering staff (several supported entirely by research grants at the current time). Thus, most of the budget goes to professional staff to facilitate the success of the individual investigators to obtain extramural funding, which funds the research of the CoE. They will have a substantial impact with the overall VA research program as they are designed to be a national resource and collaborate with a number of different VA's beyond their local medical center and nearby CoE. They make their platform available to investigators nationwide. They also have developed a number of relationships with commercial businesses which will greatly facilitate the translation of their research to the VA and the rest of the healthcare community.          Adequacy of Resources:      The current VA RR&D program is exceptional. There are a large number of funded investigators with active VA and non-VA research funding (leveraged the CoE funding to $56 million to investigators over the last grant cycle). In addition there is strong support from the VA clinical investigators, VA administration and the academic affiliates. The scientific, engineering, or medical leadership of key personnel at the VA are outstanding. As noted previously, Dr. Triolo has an exceptional track record and record of current funding. Other investigators leading the various focus areas are also outstanding. The combination of VA resources and academic affiliate resources made available are also outstanding.          Budget and Cost Effectiveness:      The budget is able to support the program activities due to investigators being funded through VA Research Career Scientist awards or external research grant funding. The requested costs are reasonable.           Additional Items:     a. Protection of Human Subjects     b. Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children     c. Vertebrate Animals     d. Biohazards          All are acceptable.          Summary Bullets:      * Outstanding track record in previous grant periods and environment     * Stellar PI and investigative team     * Importance of proposed research areas to VA research program"
"9561323","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Store-operated calcium entry, or SOCE, via calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channels regulates NFAT dependent gene expression required for lymphocyte activation and generation of immune response against antigenic insults. Orai (or CRACM) proteins form the pore subunit of CRAC channels in the plasma membrane (PM), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident stromal interaction proteins (Stims) act as store calcium sensors that oligomerize and translocate to ER-PM junctions to activate CRAC channels. However, the final steps involved in CRAC channel activation inside live cells have remained elusive. For instance, until recently it was believed that Stim1-Orai1 clustering in ER-PM junctions is sufficient to activate SOCE. However, in the absence of alpha-soluble NSF attachment protein (?-SNAP), a novel essential component of active CRAC channel complex that we have recently identified, Stim1-Orai1 clusters show a strong defect in activating SOCE. ?-SNAP directly binds Stim1 as well as Orai1 and regulates the ratio of Stim1:Orai1 molecules within CRAC channel clusters; a known determinant of CRAC channel activity and calcium selectivity. Furthermore, ?-SNAP deficient mouse primary CD4 T lymphocytes show a specific defect in SOCE, NFAT activation and cytokine gene expression. In Aim1, we propose to test the hypothesis that ?-SNAP facilitates a structural change within Stim1 that enables the Stim1-Orai1 clusters to acquire optimal Stim1:Orai1 ratios required for the functionality of CRAC channel clusters in live cells. To test our hypothesis, we will use a variety of cutting edge biochemical, structural and imaging approaches along with genetic tools. In Aim 2, we will use a combination of novel super resolution microscopy approaches to construct the 3 dimensional molecular architecture of CRAC channel macromolecular assembly in ER-PM junctional space of wildtype and ?-SNAP depleted cells. In summary, we will employ novel and highly interdisciplinary approaches to gain much needed insights into the molecular mechanism of SOCE activation via CRAC channels. Identification of new non-redundant components of the CRAC channel complex and detailed insights into their mechanism of action will be highly beneficial for drug design against autoimmune and allergic disorders."
"9443223","Project Summary Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions, affecting 37.5 million Americans. Although signal amplification in modern hearing aids makes sound more audible to hearing impaired listeners, speech understanding in background interference remains the biggest challenge by hearing aid wearers. The proposed research seeks a monaural (one-microphone) solution to this challenge by developing supervised speech segregation based on deep learning. Unlike traditional speech enhancement, deep learning based speech segregation is driven by training data, and three components of a deep neural network (DNN) model are features, training targets, and network architectures. Recently, deep learning has achieved tremendous successes in a variety of real world applications. Our approach builds on the progress made in the PI's previous R01 project which demonstrated, for the first time, substantial speech intelligibility improvements for hearing-impaired listeners in noise. A main focus of the proposed work in this cycle is to combat room reverberation in addition to background interference. The proposed work is designed to achieve three specific aims. The first aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant-noisy speech for hearing- impaired listeners. To achieve this aim, we will train DNNs to perform time-frequency masking. The second aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant speech in the presence of competing speech. To achieve this aim, we will perform DNN training to estimate two ideal masks, one for the target talker and the other for the interfering talker. The third aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant speech in combined speech and nonspeech interference. To achieve this aim, we will develop a two-stage DNN model where the first stage will be trained to remove nonspeech interference and the second stage to remove interfering speech. Eight speech intelligibility experiments involving both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners will be conducted to systematically evaluate the developed system. The proposed project is expected to substantially close the speech intelligibility gap between hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners in daily conditions, with the ultimate goal of removing the gap altogether."
"9396128","Background and Anticipated Impacts on VA Patient Care: Pre-operative testing practices have received considerable scrutiny over the past decade as sensitivity to risks and costs of unnecessary testing have increased. Preoperative tests can only be justified if they reveal actionable data that alters clinical management in a way that improves patient safety and outcomes. A recent Cochrane review of three randomized trials including over 21,000 cataract surgeries concluded that pre- operative testing does not reduce the risk of intraoperative or postoperative adverse events compared to no testing. Other studies indicate that routine testing, especially in patients without significant systemic disease undergoing low risk procedures, often does not change perioperative management, may lead to follow-up testing and invasive interventions with normal results, and can unnecessarily delay surgery or other procedures. Accordingly, the American Society of Anesthesiologists' recent ?Top-5 Activities to Avoid? include the following recommendation: ?Specific pre-operative laboratory studies should not be obtained in patients without significant systemic disease undergoing low-risk surgery.? Because they do not alter clinical management or improve patient outcomes, we define routine preoperative testing of any patients before cataract surgery and routine preoperative testing of patients without significant systemic disease undergoing other low-risk procedures as low value tests. Even in light of these research results and professional standards, several descriptive studies in diverse settings outside the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have found that low value testing is still very common. Despite the large numbers of surgeries conducted within VHA (e.g. >50,000 cataract surgeries annually), little data exists on associated patterns of preoperative testing. If patterns of low value preoperative testing are found within VHA, an important practice improvement or ?de-implementation? target exists that could afford significant opportunities to redirect resources to other organizational priorities, such as improved access and the provision of evidence-supported treatments. Therefore, in order to ensure that VHA patients receive the highest value care, are not subjected to low value testing with little or no benefit and potential unintended harm, and to ensure that VHA uses its resources to produce the largest possible positive impact on health outcomes, this study has the following aims: Aim 1: Describe system-wide and facility-level rates and associated costs of low value pre-operative testing in the 30 and 60 days before high-frequency low-risk procedures including cataract surgery (>50,000 annually), carpal tunnel release (>9,500 annually), and upper and lower digestive tract endoscopy (>500,000 annually). Aim 2: Examine the patient factors (e.g., comorbidities), clinician factors (e.g., ordering clinician specialty), and facility-level factors (e.g., surgical volume) that may be associated with the ordering of low value preoperative tests. Aim 3: Identify VHA sites with the highest rates and total expenditures on low value pre-operative testing in common low risk procedures, as well as sites that have recently switched from high to low use of low value testing. Using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), we will interview key informants at these sites in order to understand which TDF constructs are drivers of low value testing, as well as barriers to and facilitators of de-implementing low value tests."
"9530080","ABSTRACT This R21 is focused on the discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems. One of the fundamental challenges in developmental biology is delineating hierarchical cellular states including rare intermediates and the corresponding networks of regulatory genes that mediate cell-type specification. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) provides comprehensive descriptions of genomic states including those of rare intermediates and their presumptive regulators. We recently utilized scRNA-Seq and a new bioinformatics tool called Iterative Clustering and Guide Gene Selection (ICGS), as well as clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states culminating in neutrophil or macrophage specification. Strikingly, we found that myeloid cells undergoing specification traverse successive states of counter-acting transcriptional programs, which appear to be obligatory during cell-fate determination. We propose to extend this work by elucidating the key mixed-lineage intermediates that are traversed during the specification of innate and adaptive lymphocyte precursors. We will use diverse flow cytometric sorting strategies to capture a continuum of developmental intermediates undergoing innate and adaptive immune cell specification. Captured cells will be used to generate deep scRNA-Seq libraries, followed by ICGS analysis. Next, we will exploit a new lineage tracking tool to rigorously map the developmental trajectories of progenitors as they traverse via metastable intermediates to specified states in an unperturbed hematopoietic system. The proposed work will identify key mixed-lineage states that are traversed during the specification of innate and adaptive lymphocyte precursors. As such it will clarify the developmental origins of innate and adaptive lymphocytes in the hematopoietic system. Furthermore such analyses will set the stage for revealing new regulatory interactions between known transcription factors as well as new transcription factors that dictate development of innate and adaptive immune cells."
"9600197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project will develop a dendritic cell (DC)-based therapeutic vaccine to control the latent HIV-1 reservoir. Infected individuals are subject to life long treatment with antiretroviral drugs. Cessation of treatment results in a rapid rebound of virus loads that is seeded by a long-lived reservoir of latently infected T cells. The project will develop a lentiviral-vector-based, DC-targeted HIV-1 vaccine to address this problem. The approach is a two-pronged strategy that activates provirus expression in latently infected T cells and stimulates an immune response against infected cells to target them for lysis and diminish the size of the latent reservoir, with the goal of allowing patients to stop antiretroviral therapy During the R21 phase, lentiviral vectors will be generated that express HIV-1 antigens such as mosaic Gag that is optimized for CTL epitopes. The vectors will co-express CD40 ligand to increase the antigen presentation activity of the transduced DCs and stimulate antigen- specific T cell responses. The vaccine approach will then be tested in vivo using the bone marrow, liver, thymus (BLT)-humanized mouse model. HIV-infected BLT-mice on antiretroviral drugs will be injected with autologous lentiviral vector-transduced DCs to determine the fate of the transduced DCs, their role in immune activation, and their ability to disrupt the latent reservoir. BLT-mice will also be used to determine whether immunization with transduced DCs boosts HIV-specific T cell responses and facilitates control of rebound viremia following treatment interruption. The R33 phase of the project will test the lentiviral DC vaccines developed in the BLT-model in a non-human primate (NHP) pilot study using SIV-infected pig-tailed macaques. During this expanded phase, the ability of the transduced DCs to stimulate HIV-specific CTLs and target the latent reservoir will also be tested using cells from HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. The success of these studies will lay the foundation for larger scale NHP studies and clinical trials in humans."
"9436049","PROJECT SUMMARY Abnormal metabolism is a hallmark of cancer and results in altered immune function. Notably, glycolysis is of- ten enhanced in cancers, even in the presence of abundant oxygen (i.e. the Warburg effect). This form of ?aer- obic glycolysis? results in a dramatic decrease in tumor acidity due to increased concentration of lactic acid, which comes with dramatic consequences, as this is directly linked to increased tumor aggressiveness, in- creased invasion, increased genetic mutations, increased resistance to therapy, increased angiogenesis, and decreased immune function. Extensive scientific evidence supports the hypothesis that aerobic glycolysis plays an important role in gliomagenesis and altered tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (TIL)-cell function; how- ever, there remains a critical gap in our understanding of the role of extracellular acidosis and oxygen metabo- lism in altering immune function in human gliomas due to the lack of a robust non-invasive tool for measuring low pH and oxygen consumption. Thus, the purpose of the current project is to validate a new imaging tech- nique that can provide high-resolution images of regions of aerobic glycolysis, or high lactic acid production but low oxygen consumption, and explore the association between this new measurement and measures of both tumor and TIL metabolic function. The current study will investigate the central hypotheses that 1) tumor tissue undergoing high aerobic glycolysis defined by low pH and low O2 consumption can be reliably detected using multi-echo amine CEST imaging; 2) regions with high ?aerobic glycolytic index? (AGI) on MRI will have elevat- ed hypoxic and glycolytic expression levels independent of the concentration of immune cells; 3) tumors with high in vivo AGI using MRI will have high ex vivo measurements of AGI in tumor, but not immune cells; and 4) TILs extracted from tumors with high in vivo AGI measurements will have lower glucose consumption and cy- tokine production, suggestive of functional impairment. To accomplish this we will first verify the specificity of to areas of the tumor undergoing abnormal metabolism using tissue from image-guided biopsies. We hypothesize the AGI will provide high specificity for tumor and high levels of AGI will correlate with a high expression of fea- tures involved in aerobic glycolysis, including hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1?, GLUT3, and HK2. Next, we will explore the association between in vivo AGI and ex vivo AGI in both tumor and TILs using a functional assay and extracellular flux analysis estimates of the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) during metabolic manipulations of tissue extracted using image-guided biopsy. We theorize the MRI-derived AGI will show a strong positive association with the ex vivo AGI estimate of glycolytic potential in tumor but no association in TILs. Lastly, we will test whether tumors with an elevated in vivo AGI measured with MRI have dampened glucose utilization and cytokine production through ex vivo metabolic manipulation."
"9378094","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S., has long been recognized as a genetic disease. Advancement in microbial detection technology has revolutionized our view of many human diseases, and infectious etiologies have been suggested for CRC. Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a gram-negative common oral anaerobe, has been shown to stimulate CRC via its unique FadA adhesin. The goal of the current proposal is to investigate the mechanisms by which Fn promotes CRC. FadA stimulates CRC cell growth by binding to E-cadherin and activating ß-catenin signaling. Such stimulation is specific for colorectal carcinoma cells because FadA binding to other types of cells does not stimulate cell growth. We hypothesize that Fn stimulates CRC in conjunction with specific host genetic mutations. Since CRC initiates from cancer stem cells in the colon, we further hypothesize that Fn interacts with specific cancer-initiating stem cells to promote CRC. To test these hypotheses, we propose two specific aims: (i) To determine the host and bacterial components specific for Fn-stimulated colorectal tumorigenesis in vitro; and (ii) to investigate how Fn stimulates colorectal tumorigenesis in vivo. From this study, we anticipate gaining novel insights into the mechanism of colorectal tumorigenesis, and identify novel therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of CRC. Thus, it implies significant translational potential."
"9586320","Project Summary Bipolar (BP) disorder is a chronic illness of profound shifts in mood ranging from mania to depression. BP is successfully treated by combining medication with psychosocial therapy, but care can prove inadequate in practice. With gaps in coverage and medication, along with imprecise guidelines on when, where, and how to intervene, promising psychosocial therapies require adaptive strategies to better address the specific needs of individuals in a timely manner (NIMH Strategy 2). To accomplish this, however, requires evidence-based practices for adapting a psychosocial therapy. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award aims to address this knowledge gap, by (1) establishing a mobile health platform for translating a psychosocial therapy in BP into an effective adaptive intervention and (2) facilitating the transition of a junior researcher, at the interface of mathematics and psychiatry, into an independent researcher of effective adaptive interventions. The research effort is founded on a mobile health platform that combines evidence-based markers of mood for long-term monitoring with a micro-randomized trial, designed for optimizing mobile health adaptive interventions. In Aim 1, we use modeling to characterize and test new markers of mood course that account for volatility, a feature that masks effects of a therapy on mood. In Aim 2, we explore the potential for long-term monitoring of BP with interpretable markers from actigraphy. In Aim 3, best practices from Aim 1 and 2 are integrated with a micro-randomized trial into a mobile health platform. We then test the feasibility of using the platform to translate a psychosocial therapy, clinical phone call, into an adaptive intervention. If successful, this work will advance the Candidate's independent goal of adaptive scheduling of phone-calls with BP individuals. To complement the research agenda, the award will expand the Candidate's background in Computational Psychiatry into the area of Translational Psychiatry by providing training in five strategic areas: (1) clinical assessments, (2) psychosocial therapy, (3) mobile health interventions, (4) adaptive clinical trials, and (5) open-access scheduling. Dr. Melvin McInnis, Thomas B and Nancy Upjohn Woodworth Professor of Bipolar Disorder and Depression and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Michigan, will be the primary mentor and will guide clinical aspects of the training (Training Objectives 1?3); Dr. Amy Kilbourne, Professor of Psychiatry and Acting Director of VA/HSR&D's Quality Enhancement Research Initiative, will guide training in the application of adaptive trial designs that involve psychosocial therapy (Training Objectives 2,4?5); and Dr. Susan Murphy, Herbert E. Robbins Distinguished Professor of Statistics, will guide training into methodology for adaptive trial design and mobile health interventions (Training Objectives 3?4). The proposed K01 award promises to train a junior scholar to address technically-challenging problems in mental health. This work is aligned with the NIH and NIMH missions of providing precise clinical care."
"9470315","PROJECT SUMMARY 5 fluorouracil (5FU) has been the first choice chemotherapy drug for colorectal cancer (CRC) for many years; however, its clinical utility remains hampered by hematopoietic and gastrointestinal toxicities resulting from its non-selectivity. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may influence the outcome of cancer therapy indicating a role for gut bacteria in the response to chemotherapy. Emodin, a natural anthraquinone derivative found in various Chinese medicinal herbs may increase the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy agents. Further, emodin has been reported to reduce the number of harmful bacteria and augment the number of beneficial bacteria in association with a reduction in toxins in a model of renal injury. The scientific premise for my study is that if emodin can modulate the gut environment it may increase the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of 5FU in CRC. The long-term goal is to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs using complementary and integrative approaches. The objective in this particular investigation is to determine the benefits of emodin on increasing efficacy and decreasing toxicity of 5FU chemotherapy. The central hypothesis is that emodin induces changes in the gut environment that leads to increased efficacy and reduced toxicity associated with 5FU chemotherapy in CRC. I will test this hypothesis in two related specific aims: 1) determine the effects of dietary emodin on increasing efficacy and reducing toxicity of 5FU chemotherapy in CRC; and 2) determine whether emodin?s actions on 5FU chemotherapy in CRC are mediated by changes in the gut microbiota. Under the first aim, I will test the hypothesis that emodin can increase the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of 5FU in CRC. Using a chemically-induced mouse model of CRC, I will test the effects of emodin in combination with 5FU on tumorigenesis. Further, I will determine the effects of the combination treatment on behavioral outcomes including physical activity and pain measures. Finally, I will determine the benefits of emodin on mitigating the inflammation and mucositis that have been associated with 5FU. In aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that the benefits of emodin on 5FU in CRC are mediated by changes in the gut microbiota. I will test the effects of emodin on mitigating the effects of 5FU on gut microbiota. I will transfer gut microbes from 5FU treated mice to non-treated mice and administer emodin (or vehicle) to determine the perturbations associated with 5FU induced changes in the microbiota and whether emodin can mitigate these effects. Finally, I will use antibiotics and fecal transfer to determine whether emodin?s actions on increasing the efficacy of 5FU are mediated through alterations in the gut microbiota (increasing the colonization of commensal bacteria and/or reducing the number of harmful bacteria). This proposed preclinical study is significant as it will set the stage for clinical trials to develop emodin as a new complementary strategy for use with chemotherapy in CRC."
"9396040","Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD), affects an estimated 8 million people in the United States. Nearly 50% of patients with PAD die within a 10-year period. A significantly larger proportion experience disability and poor quality of life due to leg pain, and poor mobility. PAD is also a leading cause of amputation, often in patients with advanced disease who develop critical limb ischemia. Risk of myocardial infarction and stroke is also increased several-fold. While risk factors for PAD, which include smoking, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia are common in veterans, contemporary data regarding the epidemiology, treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in PAD patients remain sparse. Lack of a reliable method of identifying PAD in administrative data is a major impediment to high-quality PAD outcomes research.  The overall objective of this pilot application is to develop and validate an automated algorithm to identify patients with PAD in administrative data with a high degree of accuracy, which would facilitate the development of a nationwide PAD registry in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Given the high prevalence of PAD risk factors, and its associated morbidity and mortality, such a registry could be a powerful resource to study the epidemiology of PAD, examine intensity of risk factor modification, compare the effectiveness of different treatments, and identify opportunities for improving care.  To achieve our goals, we will extract data on key variables from reports of the ankle brachial index (ABI) - a routinely performed diagnostic test in patients with suspected PAD. The ABI is a ratio of Doppler recorded systolic blood pressure in the lower and upper extremity, and a value of < 0.90, is considered abnormal. An ABI value < 0.90 has excellent sensitivity (79%) and specificity (96%) for diagnosing PAD, which is further enhanced with incorporation of toe-brachial index (ratio of toe and brachial pressures), and vessel non- compressibility. In addition, ABI values correlate strongly with severity of PAD, risk of future limb-related and cardiovascular events, and are used for monitoring response to treatment. Currently, the ABI test results reside within dedicated test reports in the VHA?s electronic health record as semi-structured text, and therefore not available for research purposes.  We propose to update and implement an existing natural language processing (NLP) system to extract information on the above key variables from the ABI test reports, evaluate its performance on national VHA data, and determine the diagnostic accuracy of an automated algorithm based on NLP-extracted values to identify PAD. Our central hypothesis is that such an algorithm will achieve a high positive predictive value (PPV) for detecting PAD within the VHA. This application will leverage key strengths of the VHA - our nation?s largest integrated health system with a common EHR across sites. The project is a collaborative effort between investigators at the Iowa City, Nashville and Salt Lake City with operational support from VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) and the VA Office of Specialty Care. To test the above hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1. Enhance and implement an existing NLP system to extract values for ABI, TBI and presence of non- compressible arteries from ABI test reports using national VHA data  Aim 2. Determine the diagnostic accuracy of a structured algorithm based on NLP-extracted values of ABI, TBI and non-compressibility to detect PAD at the patient-level"
"9413338","Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, ?failure to thrive?) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images."
"9407287","PROJECT SUMMARY: When type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients present with disease, their immune system has already destroyed most of the beta cells in their pancreatic islets. Remaining insulin-producing islets may already be infiltrated with leukocytes, but remaining beta cell mass is instrumental for maintaining blood glucose control, leading to fewer diabetes-related complications. Therefore, controlling the immune response in the islets, particularly T cells, is of paramount importance for preserving remaining insulin production and preventing T1D progression. Our work has shown that the immune response in the islets is temporally regulated. Pathogenic T cell stimulation within the islets occurs early in islet infiltration. However, as islet infiltration advances, T cell restimulation in the islets is at least transiently suppressed, through an undefined mechanism. Our preliminary data depleting CD11c+ cells indicate that CD11c+ cells are responsible for this suppression of T cell restimulation in the islets. Islet CD11c+ cells have differing effects on T cells as islet infiltration progresses, suggesting that islet CD11c+ populations might differ over time. However, there is a gap in knowledge about the specific CD11c+ cell subsets that are present in the islets over the course of islet infiltration, the role of each CD11c+ subset in modulating T cell pathogenicity in the islets, and the mechanisms of CD11c+ cell-mediated T cell suppression in the islets. We found an islet-infiltrating CD11c+ population that expresses MerTK. MerTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates apoptotic cell uptake and that has previously been implicated in tolerizing T cells during T1D in NOD mice. Strikingly, our preliminary data show that MerTK inhibition induced rapid T1D onset in asymptomatic NOD mice with advanced islet infiltration. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that a subset of islet-infiltrating CD11c+ cells suppress T cell restimulation and effector function in the islets via a MerTK dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we will address the following aims using a variety of techniques including in vivo 2-photon microscopy, single cell RNA-seq, flow cytometry, and analysis of disease progression. Aim 1: To determine the function of islet-infiltrating CD11c+ cells and of MerTK in suppressing T cell pathogenicity within the islets. Aim 2: To identify islet CD11c+ subsets and determine mechanisms by which CD11c+MerTK+ cells promote tolerance in the islets during T1D. Aim 3: To identify the mononuclear phagocyte populations and MerTK expression in human islets during T1D progression and to determine whether MerTK expression or function is altered in T1D. Understanding the mechanisms of T cell suppression in the islets by addressing these aims could allow us to therapeutically reinforce these pathways to protect beta cells mass, insulin production, and blood glucose control in autoantibody-positive pre-diabetic or new-onset diabetic patients."
"9450471","Transcriptional Regulatory Complexes in Epidermal Differentiation  Project Summary  My long-term career goal is to lead a productive academic group at a research university, advancing the field of epithelial biology, and serving as a mentor to young scientists. My scientific interests lie in understanding the complex biology behind transcriptional regulatory networks mediating epidermal homeostasis. As I build a solid research program in this area, my immediate goals are to obtain mentorship in new areas, including epigenomics, bioinformatics, and proteomics, which will greatly enhance my current expertise in genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology. In addition to the valuable expertise provided by my mentor, six additional faculty members at Stanford University with expertise in these areas have agreed to serve as collaborators for the proposed studies. Furthermore, I will acquire additional knowledge through limited didactic courses, and participation in leadership and management seminars offered at Stanford will further prepare me for my transition to independence. Altogether, these efforts will allow me to expand my current research to provide a platform for establishing a new research group and aid in my transition to independent investigator.  The goal of this K01 proposal is to investigate the transcriptional regulatory complexes involved in epidermal differentiation. I have recently identified the MAF/MAFB transcription factors (TFs) as critical regulators of epidermal homeostasis mediating progenitor cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. These TFs are themselves regulated by long non-coding RNAs and mediate downstream activation of important epidermal TFs in cooperation with p63, the master regulator of epidermis. Furthermore, our analysis revealed MAF/MAFB localized to putative enhancers at the genomic level. Due to their ability to both suppress progenitor genes and activate terminal differentiation genes, we believe MAF/MAFB exist simultaneously in activating and repressive complexes. Thus, the aims are to 1) Characterize the epigenomic effects of MAF/MAFB during epidermal differentiation and, 2) Functionally characterize the MAF/MAFB protein interactome to understand how MAF/MAFB function in activating and repressive complexes.  We will begin by determining the epigenomic effects of MAF/MAFB in Aim I. The contribution of MAF/MAFB to chromatin accessibility and genome architecture will be addressed in the context of MAF/MAFB CRISPR-mediated knockout keratinocytes. We will use ATAC-seq to identify changes in chromatin accessibility comparing MAF/MAFB loss to control differentiated keratinocytes. To assess changes in genome shape, we will interrogate promoter:DNA contacts using capture Hi-C in control vs MAF/MAFB knockout keratinocytes that have undergone differentiation. These unbiased approaches will provide genome-wide data for characterizing the epigenome during epidermal differentiation, assessing the impact of MAF/MAFB loss, and identifying critical genomic regulatory elements required for differentiation. Furthermore, characterization of regulatory elements will allow for subsequent identification of additional factors, or potential co-regulators, involved in MAF/MAFB mediated gene regulation. We will first test candidate co-regulators already identified through FOCIS analysis of MAF/MAFB bound loci and then incorporate results from epigenomic studies to identify and characterize putative co-regulators.  In Aim II, we will focus on functionally characterizing the MAF/MAFB protein interactome. Because of their ability to suppress progenitor genes and activate differentiation genes, we hypothesized that MAF/MAFB exist simultaneously in activating and repressive complexes to mediate gene expression. We will first characterize the MAF/MAFB interactome using tandem affinity purification and a proximal protein biotinylation (BioID) approach coupled with mass spectrometry to identify proteins associating with MAF/MAFB during epidermal differentiation. These approaches will identify stable and transient MAF/MAFB interactors. To functionally characterize candidate MAF/MAFB co-regulators, we have developed a CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify factors required for terminal differentiation. Candidates that arise from this screen will be validated by gene expression profiling and in tissue models. Taken together, this aim will serve to functionally characterize MAF/MAFB activating and repressive complexes operating during epidermal differentiation.  Over the course of the training period, I plan to have expanded my expertise into the areas of epigenomics, bioinformatics, and proteomics, all while characterizing the complexity of epidermal transcriptional regulation. The findings arising from this proposal will inform the skin biology community of critical DNA regulatory elements required for human epidermal differentiation, how MAF/MAFB participates in functional regulation of these elements, and what additional factors are critical for epidermal differentiation. These findings may form the foundation of future treatment strategies for disorders characterized by disrupted epidermal homeostasis."
"9396571","Project Summary The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) and the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) are characterized by their ability to modulate reward and social behavior, respectively. The DA system influences behavior in a variety of contexts, including drugs of abuse and associative learning, and has more recently been implicated in social behavior. DA may alter social behavior through complex interactions with the OT system. DA may be the link that associates social interactions as rewarding and therefore may be a target system for understanding dysfunction of social ability. The first aim of this proposal will characterize the effect of dopaminergic manipulation on male-female social relationships in pair-living marmosets. Experimental treatments will involve administration of pharmacological agents (both agonists and antagonists) that target D1- and D2-like dopamine receptors. The second aim of the proposal examines the interaction between the OT and DA systems in the production of both pair- related social behavior and partner preference. OT agonists and antagonists will be co-administered with DA treatments to assess independent or dependent mediation of sociality by these two signaling pathways. The third aim of the proposal will examine a VNTR polymorphism in the regulatory region of the DA transporter gene (DAT1/SLC6A3). This polymorphism is associated with differential sensitivity to food reward in marmosets, and Aim 3 will evaluate whether individual differences in social relationships and reactivity to novel stimuli are explained by genetic variation. Together, these experiments will identify the independent and co-modulatory role of DA in complex social relationships, and test whether gene-based variation in one component of DA signaling (reuptake of synaptic DA) can predict the qualitative and quantitative differences of partner-directed social behavior."
"9590021","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The loss of the protective myelin shielding axons is the hallmark pathology associated with MS. The focal nature of the white matter plaques in the CNS of MS patients, and following experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) and viral induced demyelination all support the concept that a highly evolutionarily conserved regulatory mechanism(s) prevents spread of damage to adjacent uninvolved white matter areas. However, the mechanism preventing plaque expansion undefined. A novel system is described in which viral infection in mice deficient in interleukin 10 (IL-10) results in enhanced viral clearance and reduced plaque formation. However, well after is virus is eliminated from the CNS, plaques dramatically enlarge. In contrast to other rodent models, this proposal uses a viral infection in which demyelination is independent of macrophages, IL-17, or self-reactive T cells. Importantly, the data will identify the mechanism preventing expansion of focal demyelination and directly tests the emerging concept of active communication between astrocytes and microglia in regulating demyelination. This model system will allow definition of the cells secreting IL-10 and the cell which receives the signal restraining focal myelin injury. Preliminary data indicate that Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are the source of IL-10 limiting demyelination. The first aim will be accomplished by specific depletion of Treg from the CNS by infusion of diphtheria toxin using an osmotic pump approach to supply toxin intraventricularly after resolution of acute infection and confirmed by ablation of IL-10 secretion only from Treg. The second Aim will define the cell within the CNS which is the recipient of the IL-10 signaling that limit tissue damage. This will be accomplished by infecting mice in which the IL-10 receptor has been specific ablated in astrocytes, the only cell type expressing the receptor during chronic demyelination. Demyelination in this model is independent of bone marrow derived macrophages, therefore gene profiling of cells purified from the infected adult CNS will be used to define the interaction of IL-10 with astrocytes and the subsequent alteration in microglia activity. These data will provide the first evidence for a temporally distinct pathological event within the CNS that is vira induced, but distinct from the acute event and demonstrate that limiting the expansion of lesions within white matter are dependent upon the astrocyte response to the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10."
"9406338","DESCRIPTION:  Stents are the most common cardiovascular implants used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, there are concerns about in-stent restenosis with bare metal stents (BMS) and late stent thrombosis and late inflammatory responses with drug-eluting stents (DES). Despite the promise of recently developed strategies to overcome the challenges of current stents, there remain many emerging concerns and limitations. Development of innovative strategies to restore endothelial healing while limiting the risk of late stent thrombosis, inflammatory responses, and restenosis is critical for the long-term success of stents.  In nature, the endothelium is the thin layer of endothelial cells and underlying nanofibrillar basement membrane that modulates vascular tone by release of soluble factors, such as nitric oxide (NO). Endothelial dysfunction or the injury of endothelium is a hallmark of vascular diseases. The inevitable injury to this multifunctional endothelium associated with stent deployment triggers the cascade of restenosis and thrombosis.  The goal of this application is to demonstrate the prohealing effects of the novel multifunctional endothelium nanomatrix coated stent, which will minimize the risks of late stent thrombosis, restenosis, inflammatory responses, and incomplete endothelialization. The overall hypothesis of this application is that the prohealing multifunctional endothelium nanomatrix can enhance the efficacy of the stent by promoting endothelial healing on the surface of the stent.  Three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the synergistic prohealing effects of multiple components of the endothelium mimicking, self-assembled nanomatrix. Specific Aim 2: To determine the influence of hemodynamics on the prohealing multifunctional endothelium nanomatrix coated stent using a rabbit artery simulating bioreactor. Specific Aim 3: To validate the efficacy of the prohealing multifunctional endothelium nanomatrix coated stent on vasodilation of rabbit arteries ex vivo and enhanced endothelial healing in a rabbit iliac artery balloon injury model in vivo. These aims provide a paradigm changing approach that will circumvent the significant healthcare risks of current stents."
"9540620","Abstract Type A influenza virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen with the capacity to rapidly spread worldwide and to produce severe and sometimes fatal lung infections characterized by severe pneumonia. Disease severity resulting from IAV infection reflects the extent of virus replication in cells of the respiratory tract and the strength or magnitude of the host innate and adaptive immune response. Thus, the host immune response is not only responsible for IAV clearance but also contributes to tissue injury during infection. However, while the role of immune cells in virus elimination is well documented, the role of immune cells and in particular innate immune cells in regulating the susceptibility of respiratory tract cells in vivo to IAV infection is only poorly understood. We recently reported in a novel mouse model of IAV infection that upregulation of the cysteinyl leukotriene (5-lipoxygenase) metabolic pathway in terminal airway (alveolar) epithelial cells is associated with enhanced susceptibility of these cells to IAV infection. Furthermore, terminal airway resident (alveolar) macrophages suppress the upregulation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in terminal airway epithelial cells and as a consequence reduce the susceptibility of the cells to IAV infection. The program described in this application is designed to explore the role of the 5-lipoxygenase metabolic pathway and signaling via cysteinyl leukotriene receptors in controlling the susceptibility of airway epithelial cells to IAV infection and the mechanism by which terminal airway macrophages reduce susceptibility. We will establish the requirement for 5-lipoxygenase pathway enzymatic activity, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor signaling in terminal airway epithelial cells and explore the mechanism by which signaling through this receptor enhances susceptibility to IAV infection (Aim 1). In conjunction, we will explore the interaction between terminal airway macrophages, airway epithelial cells and IAV resulting in suppression of susceptibility of airway epithelial cells to infection, the mechanism of macrophage action leading to suppression and extend this analysis into the human (Aim 2)."
"9429431","PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Jonathan Juliano is an internationally recognized leader in malaria research and a pioneer in the use of next generation sequencing technologies for applied genomics projects. He is an Associate Professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he has helped to establish a major center for translational malaria research. He has had continuous independent NIH funding since 2010. Dr. Juliano is committed to an academic career in patient-oriented research (POR), in which he and his trainees address problems with direct relevance to malaria control. Recently, he received the prestigious 2016 Distinguished Teaching Award for Post-Baccalaureate Instruction at UNC for his strong record of mentoring trainees, which focuses on Infectious Disease fellows and MD/PhD students involed in POR. The proposed K24 award will allow Dr. Juliano to develop new research skills to enhance his research expertise and mentorship by gaining skills in statistical genetics and population genomics, by learning strategies for effective leadership, and by enhancing his mentoring skills. The proposed research will establish new research opportunities to foster the career development of his trainees. To achieve his goals, Dr. Juliano will leverage the extensive training resources available at UNC, including the NC Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, the Gillings School of Global Public Health, and the School of Medicine. Dr. Juliano?s involvement in these programs, as well as the School of Medicine MD/PhD program and the UNC Infectious Diseases Fellowship program, ensures that he will be well positioned to recruit and mentor trainees, including students, fellows and junior faculty. As part of this proposal, he will receive both formal and informal guidance to develop as a mentor and also increase his participation in formal mentoring activities on campus. Central to Dr. Juliano?s research is understanding antimalarial resistance. The emergence of drug-resistant malaria parasites is a major hurdle in the control of Plasmodium falciparum, which has evolved resistance to nearly every antimalarial drug in use. Importantly, little is known about how parasite populations evolve to permit the emergence and spread of resistance. Statistical genetics and demographic inference provide a framework for understanding parasite population characteristics that impact the rate and timing of the spread of resistance. These approaches provide an opportunity to predict future paths for the spread of resistance and to help develop targeted interventions. The Demographic Inference to Study Antimalarial Resistance Migration (DISARM) study will translate advances made in statistical genetics for humans to the study of malaria parasite populations. The proposed K24 will permit Dr. Juliano to develop a research platform that is a natural extension of his previous work, represents a significant methodological advance for the study of malaria, and provides rich opportunities for direct mentorship of trainees and young faculty members."
"9525523","Abstract Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kpn) is a leading cause of Gram-negative nosocomial infections and is associated with a high mortality rate. Antibiotic resistance is a growing issue among the Enterobacteriaceae and of the Enterobacteriaceae Kpn is the most prevalent ESBL (extended spectrum ?-lactamase) and CRE (carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae) isolate. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Kpn only serves to compound its clinical importance and to complicate treatment options. Kpn strains are broadly classified as hypervirulent (hv) or classical, with hv strains typically causing community acquired liver abscess infections and invasive infections. Classical strains are more typically associated with nosocomial infections. The hv strains have a hypermucoviscous (Hmv+) phenotype due in part to hyper-production of capsule. Recent genomic analyses of large strain sets have advanced our understanding of the different subgroups of Kpn, yet we still do not have a clear picture of the genetic traits required by each group to cause disease. Despite significant diversity in the capsule type and amount of capsule, capsule is an essential virulence factor for all Kpn. Capsule production in Kpn is tightly regulated and a number of transcriptional regulators have been identified, including RcsB and RmpA. Using an Hmv+ strain (KPPR1) our lab recently identified three new transcription factors (RmpC, KvrA and KvrB) required for full expression of capsule synthesis genes and for full virulence. All five regulators cause similar decreases in expression of one of the capsule promoters. In murine infections, these mutants each are attenuated, but curiously not to the same degree. In addition, some of the regulatory mutants retain the Hmv+ phenotype whereas others are Hmv- suggesting they play roles beyond controlling expression of the cps locus. We recently extended these findings to an hv strain with a different capsule type and will also test findings in an ST258 strain. Our data suggest that some of the findings from KPPR1 will be conserved between strains of Kpn. Thus, we hypothesize these regulators regulate multiple and varying steps in the pathway producing capsule, Hmv, and possibly additional virulence determinants. To address this hypothesis we propose the following aims: Aim 1. Regulation of capsule production. RcsB, RmpA, RmpC, KvrA and KvrB all affect production of capsule yet little is known of the mechanism of this regulation. We will address this by examining regulatory effects at the known cps promoters, determining if the regulators function independently or dependently, and which directly bind the cps promoter. Aim 2. Determine the regulons of each transcriptional regulator. As each of the five regulators affects capsule production and yet the virulence phenotypes differ, they likely regulate additional virulence determinants. Thus, we will use RNA-seq to identify genes impacted by each of these transcriptional regulators. Follow-up studies will include in vivo and in vitro virulence studies to better understand the contribution of each regulator to pathogenesis. Collectively, we aim to correlate pathogenesis with the genes affected by the regulators. ! !"
"9411769","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on the model of its successful distance learning Masters of Science in Bioethics and its web-based Advanced Certificate Program in Research Ethics in Central and Eastern Europe (FIC-NIH Grant R25 TW007085; E-Education in Research Ethics: Central and Eastern Europe), Union Graduate College (UGC) proposes to develop and developer graduate level online and onsite programs in research ethics for the Caribbean Basin. Offered in partnership with St. George's University (SGU) in Grenada and the Universidad Aut?noma de Quer?taro (UAQ) in Mexico, the purpose of this program is to build capacity in research ethics in the 21 independent low- and middle-income countries that border the Caribbean Sea. Three levels of training will be provided to students: a Certificate (Certificado) in Research Ethics, a Diploma (Diplomado) in Research Ethics, and a Masters of Science in Bioethics. Certificate and Diploma courses will be offered in both English and Spanish at SGU and UAQ respectively, using a mix of online courses and onsite seminars. The use of a hybrid online/onsite approach means that most trainees will be able to receive in-depth comprehensive graduate education in research ethics without leaving their jobs or their home countries. In sequence four cohorts of 8-10 English-speaking students and four cohorts of 8-10 Spanish-speaking students will complete the 6-month, 3-course Certificate (1 onsite and 2 online courses) and the 6-month, 3-course Diploma (1 onsite and 2 online courses) programs. Of the students completing the Diploma program, four will be offered a scholarship to go on to complete the online Masters of Science in Bioethics at UGC. The partnership will also create the infrastructure to support the four cohorts of English- and Spanish-speaking students, train and mentor faculty from the region who can continue these training programs once the funding period ends, provide public online resources on research ethics for the Caribbean Basin, and develop St. George's University and the Universidad Aut?noma de Quer?taro as regional centers of excellence in bioethics and research ethics."
"9428397","Brain tumors cause more deaths in children than any other form of cancer. Most pediatric brain tumor patients receive surgery and radiation as key elements of treatment. To help surgeons maximally and safely remove brain tumors, we previously discovered and developed Tumor Paint, which delivers fluorescent signal to brain tumor cells in pediatric clinical trials. Chlorotoxin (CTX), the scorpion-derived tumor targeting peptide, crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and specifically binds to cancer cells. Because chlorotoxin can deliver fluorescent molecules to the cytoplasm of brain tumor cells, we hypothesized that it could carry therapeutic molecules as well. As we focus on developing therapeutic candidates that use CTX or CTX pharmacophores, it becomes essential to understand the mechanism of BBB penetration. In addition to work on CTX-based brain tumor therapies (e.g., delivery of chemotherapy or immunotherapy to brain tumors), we have made significant progress on a candidate drug that could potentially help every child who undergoes radiation therapy for brain tumors. Because brain irradiation causes severe and irreversible neurocognitive damage in children, we aspire to engineer a therapeutic agent that blocks the toxic respiratory burst of microglia in normal brain following radiation. Blockade of the Kv1.3 potassium ion channel on microglia has been shown to block radiation damage to normal brain in mice. We have engineered an optide (optimized peptide) that specifically blocks Kv1.3 but unfortunately does not, in its current form, cross the BBB. The gap in knowledge that we intend to address is that the mechanism by which CTX and some other optides penetrate the BBB is unknown. Because the Lys27 face of CTX is sterically hindered by a fluorophore in the Tumor Paint clinical candidate that crosses the BBB in children, we hypothesize that the pharmacophore responsible for BBB penetration lies on a different face than the face that contains Lys27. The key hurdle that prevents clinical development of an optide that blocks Kv1.3 to alleviate radiation-induced brain damage is that it does not cross the BBB and therefore fails to reach its target. We hypothesize that we can engineer the candidate Kv1.3 blocker in a manner that fosters BBB penetration. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To identify the pharmacophore of chlorotoxin responsible for BBB penetration Aim 2: To identify the transporter responsible for optide penetration of the BBB Aim 3: To create an optide that has a therapeutic pharmacophore and a BBB-penetrating pharmacophore The significance of this work is that we will produce a clinical development candidate that could alleviate severe brain damage caused by irradiation in children. The foundational knowledge could be applied to a new generation of drugs for many brain disorders."
"9432185","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The therapeutic potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) could be significantly enhanced by methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) or reprogrammed adult cells. Thus, there has been great interest in understanding the embryologic origin of HSC and the signal pathways that guide HSC development and self-renewal, such that the process of HSC genesis can be recapitulated in vitro, a goal which has yet to be realized. Given the heterogeneity and developmental asynchrony in hemogenic precursors during their emergence in the embryo, to achieve this it will be necessary to develop better strategies to isolate and characterize the rare precursors capable of giving rise to HSC and to understand the signals that drive their development to functional, engrafting HSC. To this end, I have established that endothelial cells (EC) derived from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (AGM), the niche in which the first HSC emerge, can promote the in vitro specification and self-renewal of engrafting HSC from hemogenic precursors, including recent studies at the single cell level. Furthermore, I have shown that the Notch pathway functions in both specification and self-renewal of HSC in the EC niche, and that use of immobilized Notch ligands to activate the Notch pathway, along with hematopoietic cytokines, is sufficient to induce expansion of embryonic HSC. Building upon this work, the goals of this proposal are to utilize this novel in vitro AGM-EC system to elucidate the phenotypic, molecular, and functional properties of HSC precursors as they transition to functional HSC capable of long-term, multilineage engraftment. This will require isolation and functional characterization of HSC precursors across different stages of their development at the single cell level (Aim 1), followed by single cell transcriptional analysis to determine the gene regulatory networks and molecular signals promoting their development to functional HSC (Aim 2A). In studies working toward the engineering of stromal cell-free systems for HSC generation, agonists of identified signaling pathways will be functionally tested for their capacity to support HSC development in conjunction with the known requirement for Notch signaling activation (Aim 2B). Altogether, these studies will provide novel insight into the unique properties of HSC precursors, as well at the signaling mechanisms governing their maturation to functional HSC, which will have important implications in advancing our ability to generate HSC from PSC. To accomplish these aims, I will leverage the wealth of resources available in the mentoring laboratory of Dr. Bernstein, as well as key resources available at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington, and Seattle Children?s Hospital, and opportunities for co-mentorship from Dr. Shahin Rafii at the Ansary Stem Cell Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College. A key aspect of my career development plan is to also acquire new skills that will facilitate my research objectives, including techniques in single cell RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis which will be performed in collaboration with and under the co-mentorship of Dr. Cole Trapnell in Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. This type of interdisciplinary training will provide me with the tools necessary to apply innovative technologies in unravelling the complexity of niche- stem cell interactions that instruct HSC fates. My research experience studying hematopoietic stem cell development has provided me with a strong background to facilitate success in the proposed research goals. My clinical experience in caring for children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has cemented a strong passion to expand scientific knowledge of HSC and translate this knowledge to improve therapies for children with hematologic, immunologic, and oncologic diseases. Success in my research and career development goals outlined in this proposal will enable me to establish an independent academic career as a physician-scientist with the skills to lead a diverse research team and collaborate broadly to address essential questions in stem cell biology. Ultimately, my long-term goal is to develop a laboratory-based career with focus on taking fundamental principles discovered through basic research in developmental HSC biology toward clinical applications in hematopoietic stem cell therapeutics."
"9421923","Project Summary/Abstract Patients with end-stage renal disease treated with hemodialysis (HD) report poor health-related quality life, in part because of the large number of troubling symptoms they experience. One of the most frequently reported such symptom is insomnia and includes patients' difficulties in falling asleep, frequently waking up after falling asleep, and early morning awakening. There are unique issues pertaining to HD treatments and schedules that disrupt regular sleep/wake routines and contribute to the high prevalence and severity of insomnia. A large body of evidence from HD patients and other populations also indicate that insomnia is associated with fatigue, daytime sleepiness, pain, depressive symptoms, and a higher risk for death. Despite evidence for broad- ranging health effects of insomnia, no clinical trials have tested the efficacy of treatments for HD patients. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first line therapy but is inaccessible to HD patients in the United States as they have to commit to thrice weekly dialysis treatments in community- based dialysis facilities; CBT-I delivered by telehealth can overcome the barriers but its efficacy has never been rigorously tested for any patient population. Pharmacotherapy is the most widely used treatment for insomnia for HD patients - while some drugs presently used are unsafe as they are associated with a higher risk for death for this patient population (benzodiazepines and zolpidem-like drugs), the efficacy of others (trazodone) has never been tested for HD patients. With this application, we propose to test the short- and long-term comparative effectiveness of 6-week treatment with telehealth CBT-I, trazodone, or medication placebo. This will be accomplished with a randomized controlled clinical trial in which 125 HD patients with chronic insomnia treated in community-based dialysis facilities in Seattle and Albuquerque will be assigned 2:2:1 to telehealth CBT-I, trazodone, and medication placebo, respectively; short-term effectiveness will be determined at the end of 6-weeks of treatment and long-term effectiveness at 24-weeks. Telehealth CBT-I will be delivered through a mobile platform, iHOPE, by English and Spanish-speaking therapists. The primary and secondary patient reported outcomes will be assessed with computer-based telephone interviewing by research scientists blinded to treatment assignment. The study will be conducted under the oversight of highly experienced Clinical and Data Coordinating Centers in Seattle with a strong track record of patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials, and implementing behavioral interventions with high fidelity to the protocol. This clinical trial will provide the first evidence for the comparative effectiveness of two distinct approaches in improving insomnia and other patient-reported outcomes for HD patients. It will also be the first rigorous evaluation of telehealth CBT-I, a readily scalable approach not only for HD patients but also for other patient populations with difficulty accessing treatment for insomnia."
"9403265","Project Summary/Abstract There are two main objectives of this Core. First, we intend to provide training in the use of stable isotope technology within the BTRC for use by scientists and clinicians outside the BTRC. The goal is to expand the general knowledge of how to use stable isotopes for investigation of metabolic questions in intact tissues and patients. Much of the technology, once understood, is easily transferred to most university and medical school settings in the United States. Second, we intend to disseminate the results of the work described in the TR&D projects to the clinical and scientific community. The goal is to make physicians and biomedical scientists aware of the capabilities of the technologies and to encourage use of the advances from the BTRC. To achieve these goals, we propose four specific aims. Aim 1 is to continue to present a two-day Annual Symposium with a focus on magnetic resonance and metabolism. The first day will be refocused on training in technology and the second day will continue to present broader biological and clinical topics that are relevant to the technology developed in the BTRC. Aim 2 is to provide training tailored to the needs of visiting scientists, students, medical housestaff and subspeciality clinical fellows as necessary to allow investigators outside the BTRC to apply the technology to clinical problems. Aim 3 is to disseminate results and technologies via multiple strategies including a continued local Mini-Symposium for Undergraduates, continued participation in the NIH Isotope Course presented by the NIDDK, a newly proposed training course in 13C isotopomer and flux analysis at the World Molecular Imaging Congress, the web page and teaching in graduate courses. Aim 4 is to disseminate open source software designed for experiment planning, spectral analysis and metabolic fitting of 13C tracer experiments. Together, our training and dissemination activities provide a wide range of opportunities for investigators to learn to use stable isotopes for their studies in intermediary metabolism in patients and other systems."
"9465988","The CDC reports that food allergy incidence in the U.S. is rising, with 5-8% of children now afflicted and 40% having a history of severe and potentially life-threatening reactions. In order to reduce this high incidence, new guidelines recently issued by the NIAID and also by leading allergists recommend that children between 4-6 months of age be introduced to highly allergenic foods such as peanuts, milk and eggs. In addition, children with a high propensity for allergies, such as in the case of severe eczema, should be tested for allergies prior to dietary introduction of the foods. Overall, allergy testing plays a vital role in the prevention, management and treatment of allergic disease, for example in initial diagnosis or in predicting the likelihood of anaphylaxis. The current gold standard approach for blood-based allergy testing for children (and adults) is the ImmunoCAP® system (Thermo Scientific), which performs single-plex solid-phase immunoassays to measure the concentration of circulating allergen-specific IgE antibodies (sIgEs). However, ImmunoCAP®, introduced more than two decades ago, lacks several critical features required to meet current and emerging pediatric food allergy testing needs including: i) ability to test for all necessary allergens from a single drop of blood collected from a heel- or finger- stick; ii) meet the high throughput needs of central testing labs; and iii) achieve lower costs. Importantly, in addition to these characteristics, new tests must meet or exceed the current diagnostic performance of ImmunoCAP®. Significant progress has been made during the Phase II SBIR towards meeting these needs. AmberGen's patented AllerBead? multiplex technology has been evaluated using venous blood collected from a cohort of >650 children in collaboration with Boston Children's Hospital. AllerBead? results from 10 allergens covering the 8 most common food allergies, requiring only 100 µL of blood, were compared to ImmunoCAP® measurements, requiring 1 mL of blood. Average Pearson correlation (r) of AllerBead? with ImmunoCAP® was 0.90, with 96% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Critical to achieving gold standard diagnostic performance was the incorporation of patented PC-PURE? technology into AllerBead? to eliminate the matrix effect which hampers multiplex immunodiagnostics. Furthermore, a prototype automated AllerBead? system was developed which produces 4,000 results/shift versus only 250 for a comparably priced ImmunoCAP® instrument. The next phase of research required for commercialization will involve full implementation of an automated AllerBead? system using finger- stick collected blood. For this purpose, a large-scale IRB approved study will be performed in collaboration with Dr. Lynda Schneider at Boston Children's Hospital to compare the results from AllerBead? performed using finger- stick blood collection with ImmunoCAP® testing of venous drawn blood from the same patients. High affinity PC- Microwell Plates? will be optimized to facilitate PC-PURE? automation and provide industry-leading throughput."
"9378371","(7) Project Summary/Abstract Specific Aims The current proposal first aims to extend previous genetic studies of level of response (LR) to alcohol by conducting the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of LR to date through the meta-analysis of multiple samples with extant SRE (Self-Rating of the Effects of Alcohol) and GWAS data. A second aim is to use summary data from the described GWAS of LR to create polygenic risk scores in an independent sample in order to determine whether, and to what extent, the genetic influences underlying LR to alcohol serve as a risk factor for AUD. Method Towards the abovementioned aims, datasets will be processed according to standard quality control (QC) procedures (e.g., Anderson et al., 2010) allowing for genotype imputation to a common reference panel and GWA analysis of each dataset using methods appropriate for the individual study designs. For all identified samples (see attached contribution letters) Dr. Marc Schuckit (consultant) will provide critical support in decisions regarding the use of the SRE phenotype. All data-analytic procedures will be conducted in coordination with Dr. Ian Gizer (sponsor), Dr. Arpana Agrawal (consultant), and the respective dataset contributors to ensure that all data are analyzed according to mutually-agreed upon procedures. Following individual study-level GWA analyses, standardized GWAS meta-analysis QC procedures will be carried out (Winkler et al., 2014) and a meta-analysis combining results from all samples will be conducted utilizing a fixed-effects model in METAL (Willer et al., 2010). Lastly, results from the SRE meta-analysis will be utilized to compute polygenic risk scores (PRS) in an independent target sample to examine the predictive ability of the LR to alcohol PRS for AUD outcomes. The Australian Twin Families (OZ-ALC GWAS) sample accessed from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) will be used to accomplish this second aim. Long-Term Objectives The over-arching goal of the current proposal is to utilize GWA meta-analytic procedures and polygenic modeling approaches to synthesize quantitative data across multiple GWA datasets in order to advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of AUD etiology, as well as a well-established biological risk mechanism of AUD development (i.e., LR to alcohol). Through the combination of multiple genetically-informed datasets, the current study is well-positioned to examine the genetic factors underlying a well-defined endophenotype of AUD, LR to alcohol. Additionally, polygenic prediction models will serve to expand our knowledge of the polygenic architecture underlying LR to alcohol, as well as the shared genetic contributions between LR to alcohol and AUD. By gaining a more precise understanding of the genetic architecture of LR, and the subsequent susceptibility for AUD, we can make substantial progress towards integrating this genetic information in treatment approaches with the goal of developing personalized AUD intervention efforts. Training Aims The current proposal will allow the applicant to gain valuable experience in management, integration, and data analysis procedures for investigating alcohol use outcomes in large-scale, genetically-informed datasets, as well as knowledge in the application of state-of-the-art polygenic modeling approaches for examining the aggregate effect of genetic variation across the genome. The nature of these training experiences will provide an immersive experience for the applicant through close collaboration with multiple research groups. Thus, successful completion of these training aims will provide the foundation for the applicant?s career objective of obtaining a tenure-track academic position investigating AUD phenotypes in large, consortia-derived, genetic datasets and how best to leverage findings from such studies to improve clinical outcomes."
"9597856","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Northwestern University Udall Center of Excellence in Parkinson's disease Research, now in its 10th year. In the last award period, this highly productive research team made fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease, resulting in over 50 peer-reviewed publications. Our studies also motivated a successful Phase II clinical trial with isradipine. The program continues under the direction of Dr. D. James Surmeier. There are 4 scientific projects, 1 translational project, an administrative core and a molecular biology core built around 2 central themes: 1) the determinants of selective neuronal vulnerability in Parkinson's disease and 2) the determinants of the network pathophysiology responsible for the core motor symptoms of the disease. Project 1, directed by Dr. Surmeier, builds upon ground-breaking work in the last grant period to pursue the role of the pedunculopontine nucleus and nicotine in regulating oxidant stress in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. Project 2, directed by Dr. Savio Chan, pursues the mechanisms governing the emergence of synchronous rhythmic bursting in globus pallidus neurons in Parkinson's disease, focusing on a novel class of these neurons that project to the striatum. Project 3, directed by Dr. Mark Bevan, explores the role of cortical and pallidal input t the subthalamic nucleus in driving oscillatory behavior in Parkinson's disease. Project 4, directed by Dr. Charles Wilson, explores the mechanisms underlying the symptomatic benefit of deep brain stimulation. Project 5, directed by Dr. Richard Miller, is a translational project; this  project will test the neuroprotective potential of a novel selective antagonist of Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels, as well as two anti-inflammatory agents; this project will also test the ability of  novel gene therapy targeting GluN2D-containing glutamate receptors to produce symptomatic relief in a Parkinson's disease model. These projects make use of advanced molecular, optogenetic, pharmacogenomics, imaging and electrophysiological approaches to achieve their aims. The administrative core will oversee the program budget/subcontract arrangements, biannual meetings, external and internal advisory committees, archiving and distribution of program publications, compilation and submission of annual NIH program renewal applications, and maintenance of a program web page. The molecular core will provide gene expression analysis for each of the projects, provide consultation and assistance for genotyping, and provide assistance in the design and construction of viral vectors for gene knockdown and to provide assistance in the design and construction of viral vectors for gene delivery. The successful attainment of our programmatic goals should bring us closer to meeting the two grand challenges facing the Parkinson's disease research community: to develop a disease-modifying therapy and to develop better, longer lasting symptomatic therapies."
"9428796","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goals of this proposed project are 1) to develop Dr. Mia Minen into a pain researcher in integrative and complementary health with skills to conduct independent multidisciplinary research; and 2) to conduct a clinical research study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a relaxation intervention for migraine patients who present to the emergency department (ED). Dr. Minen will develop and advance her knowledge base, experience, and skills in 5 key areas through mentored training: 1) Mind-body intervention (MBI) techniques; 2) Advanced research methods (in health services, clinical trials, and mobile health strategies); 3) Emergency medicine pain research methodology and responsible conduct; 4) New research design frameworks; and 5) Prevention science, program intervention development, and comparative effectiveness research. The long-term goal of the research training is to be able to independently develop, assess, refine, and compare novel and existing evidence-based MBIs for migraine patients across medical specialties, with a special focus on the emergency medicine and primary care settings. In addition, the purpose of the training is to gain advanced skills to study the MBIs alone and in combination with nutraceuticals and medications. The research proposed in this K23 application is important to understanding how evidence-based MBIs can be made more accessible for chronic pain patients in the acute care setting. It helps to set the framework for translating evidence-based MBIs into use in other medical settings. Migraine, the chronic pain condition being used as an example for study, is a significant public health issue. Migraine affects over 30 million Americans, and it is considered to be one of the most disabling conditions. It is responsible for a substantial number of the five million headache visits/year to US EDs. The purpose of this research is to study use of progressive muscle relaxation, a MBI, in patients with migraine who present to the emergency department. During the study, we will use patient feedback to optimize the smartphone application (app) RELAXaHEAD, an app with PMR and a daily headache diary. We will then conduct a feasibility and acceptability study of the RELAX approach (use of RELAXaHEAD and abortive migraine pain medication). The results of this research will inform a future R01 application to conduct a large-scale trial of MBI for migraine patients who present to the ED. The proposed research and training will be conducted at New York University Langone Medical Center's ED. Dr. Minen's mentorship and advisory team includes an interdisciplinary team with experts in MBI and behavioral research, mobile health, headache medicine, emergency medicine, qualitative and mixed methods research, population health, and statistics. The proposed research and training plans will provide a strong foundation for Dr. Minen as an independently funded clinical investigator dedicated to using MBIs alone and in combination with nutraceuticals and medications to improve the care of chronic pain patients in the acute care setting."
"9407064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this proposal is to identify and refine novel metabolic biomarkers that incrementally improve CVD risk prediction models and help predict the best obesity intervention to improve metabolic health, to begin to move towards a more personalized approach to obesity management for prevention of CVD. While obesity is a well-recognized risk factor for CVD-related morbidity and mortality, attributed to the increased prevalence of intermediate risk factors, there is heterogeneity in the prevalence of these risk factors in obese individuals.5 This disconnect leads to incomplete CVD risk prediction models and difficulty in identification of those obese individuals at greatest need for intensive therapeutic interventions for prevention of CVD events. Emerging molecular profiling technologies have begun to fill this gap. Building on a foundation of our previous work, we now propose here to use metabolomics profiling to develop biomarkers for identification of those obese individuals at greatest risk of CVD and, importantly, to build integrated clinico-metabolic models that would facilitate personalization of obesity interventions to prevent CVD. Our Specific Aims are (1) to test the hypothesis that previously identified metabolic signatures are associated with CVD-related clinical measures in obese individuals and with obesity interventions; (2) to use unbiased metabolomics approaches to identify novel biomarkers associated with these biomarkers; and (3) to develop an integrated clinico-molecular model incorporating clinical variables and metabolic biomarkers."
"9412197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nervous systems from invertebrates to humans have shown remarkably resilient and adaptive abilities to maintain stable functionality despite challenges that may otherwise lead to suboptimal or uncontrolled activity. In each of these systems, perturbations to synaptic activity initially lead to corresponding alterations in synaptic strength. However, given sufficient time, nervous systems in these organisms adapt by modulating presynaptic release or postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors to re-target previous levels of synaptic strength. This process, termed homeostatic synaptic plasticity, is thought to enable stable, yet flexible, synaptic activity and to play key roles in tuning neural function in health and disease. Yet there is a major gap in our knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that endow synapses with these extraordinary abilities. The long term goal of this proposal is to identify the genes and elucidate the mechanisms that achieve and maintain the homeostatic control of synaptic strength. To understand the principles governing homeostatic synaptic signaling, we will utilize the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, which has been established as a powerful genetic system to study this process. This proposal will use a combination of genetic analysis, electrophysiology, and imaging approaches to investigate the homeostatic mechanisms that enhance presynaptic release in response to a perturbation to postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor function. In particular, three genes encoding neuronal transmembrane proteins have been identified that appear to function together in the presynaptic terminal to promote the calcium-dependent, homeostatic potentiation of synaptic transmission. Interestingly, these genes have been associated with epilepsy, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. The proposed experiments will first characterize these molecules in synaptic function and homeostatic plasticity. Confocal and super-resolution microscopy will then be utilized to reveal the subsynaptic localization and cellular activities of these proteins. Finally, complementary forward genetic screens are proposed to identify new genes that orchestrate homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Together, this work is expected to reveal new homeostatic genes and mechanisms that control the adaptive modulation of synaptic strength and provide a foundation from which to understand how transcellular homeostatic signaling systems more generally are established in the nervous system."
"9463945","Low dose CT screening (LDCT) has been approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for Medicare coverage. However, the primary problem associated with CT is the high false positive  detections (~96%). This issue often leads to unpleasant and costly unintended consequences (e.g.,  follow-up scans and/or invasive biopsies). In this project, we propose to develop and commercialize  a novel computer tool to aid in accurate assessment of indeterminate lung nodules. The goal is to  accurately and efficiently quantify the potential risk of developing lung cancer and its future  prognosis, thereby facilitating precise / personalized lung cancer screening and optimal patient  management. During Phase I of this project, we have accomplished the proposed milestones and  developed a prototype system that is now publicly accessible. Our preliminary validation of the  prototype system demonstrates very promising performance. In Phase II, we will continue our effort  to make this tool available to serve clinical community with the following specific aims: (1)  develop a generalized framework that supports the incorporation of both image and patient  information as well as other biological tests related to lung cancer; (2) fully optimize the  computer algorithms to efficiently analyze chest CT scans and in particular synergize our  algorithms with the deep learning technology to improve training efficiency and benign/malignance  classification accuracy; and (3) comprehensively validate and optimize the system in clinical  environment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We believe that the proposed  system is extremely timely and important in light of the CMS decision to cover annual LDCT lung  cancer screening. Its availability will significantly reduce the over-diagnosis associated with  LDCT for lung cancer screening and relieve the economic burden on healthcare system."
"9412872","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is a chronic and complex metabolic disease. Chronic high glucose exposure produces impaired angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis during wound healing resulting in skin ulcerations of the lower extremities (leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputation) and making diabetes a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR2/3) are critical regulators of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Importantly, VEGFR2/3 is significantly reduced in the vascular endothelium of diabetic patients. However, the mechanisms responsible for the VEGFR2/3 loss remain poorly understood. Prolonged high glucose exposure reportedly induces ligand-independent degradation of Golgi-localized VEGFR2; however the degradative pathway has not been defined. Intriguingly, we unveil that diabetic conditions elevate autophagosome components, Ulk1 and LC3B and induce VEGFR2/3 targeting to autophagosomes. Given that VEGFR2/3 depletion drives impaired diabetic wound healing, whether autophagosomes mediate degradation of Golgi-localized VEGFR2 is a highly significant and open question. Our latest data show that epsins, endocytic adaptor proteins critical for ligand-induced VEGFR2/3 internalization and degradation in physiologic conditions, are upregulated and interact with Ulk1/LC3B and VEGFR2/3 in autophagosomes in diabetes. Epsin deficiency inhibits diabetes-induced loss of cell surface VEGFR2/3 independent of VEGF. Thus, we hypothesize that epsins promote the degradation of cell surface VEGFR2/3 by targeting VEGFR2/3 to autophagosomes, and autophagic degradation downregulates both new synthesized Golgi-localized and cell surface VEGFR2/3 to effectively decrease VEGFR2/3 levels in diabetic endothelium. Lastly, we hypothesize that disrupting epsins and Ulk1 to protect VEGFR2/3 from diabetic-induced autophagic degradation may offer a new therapeutic strategy to combat retarded diabetic wound healing. In Aim 1, we will determine mechanisms underlying diabetes-induced degradation of intracellular VEGFR2/3. The proposed studies will identify novel mechanisms by which LC3B and Ulk1 mediate degradation of Golgi-localized VEGFR2/3 in the diabetic endothelium. In Aim 2, we will determine mechanisms of diabetes-induced cell surface VEGFR2/3 autophagic degradation. These studies will provide novel information on how epsins and Ulk1/LC3B cooperatively regulate ligand-independent cell surface VEGFR2/3 degradation. In Aim 3, we will examine the therapeutic potential of epsins and Ulk1 null animals in diabetic angiogenesis using in vitro angiogenesis assays and in vivo diabetic wound healing and Matrigel plug assays in our novel db/db and Akita diabetic mouse models with combinatorial conditional depletion of endothelial epsins and Ulk1. These studies will shed light upon the beneficial effects of epsins and Ulk1 loss in diabetes, and test the combinatory therapeutic potential of epsin and Ulk1 inhibition in the treatment of defective diabetic peripheral angiogenesis."
"9445842","Project Summary Our intestines comprise over 50% of our bodies immune cells and tightly maintains a constant state of homeostasis against foreign stimulus like food particles and bacteria. This immune ?tolerance? is broken during chronic intestinal inflammation as seen during inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Adverse CD4+ THelper responses perpetuate the chronic pathology observed in IBD, thus understanding the molecular mechanisms that control their function is central to endeavors of finding novel therapeutic treatments. A physiologic adaptive response to inflammation is a marked shift in the supply and demand of metabolites that results in limited oxygen availability (now termed inflammatory hypoxia) and activation of the transcription factors hypoxia- inducible-factors (HIFs). While there are multiple affects of hypoxia on T cell gene function, the effects on post- transcriptional regulation are underexplored. To investigate hypoxia-elicited tissue protective signaling we performed a screen of CD4+ T cell-specific miRNAs and identified a selective induction of miR-29a. Studies with genetic models identified a role of Hif-2? in miR-29a induction and subsequent experiments demonstrated repression of the miR-29a target-genes Tbet and IFN? (canonical TH1 markers) during hypoxia. Mice with a T- cell-intrinsic deficiency in Hif-2? displayed elevated Tbet levels in CD4+ T cells and exacerbated inflammation during experimental colitis. Based on these preliminary studies, we hypothesize that Hif-2? induction of miR- 29a suppresses TH1 CD4+ cell activation. In this proposal we will address this hypothesis with three integrated lines of investigation. Firstly, we will examine how Hif-2? transcriptionally induces miR-29a and the functional requirements for Hif-2? in CD4+ THelper differentiation. Second, we will assess the role of miR-29a in the regulation of T cell mediated colitis. Lastly, in proof of concept studies we will target miR-29a stabilization in vivo during experimental colitis. Collectively these studies aim to dissect the Hif-2?-miR-29a-Tbet axis in the regulation of CD4+ T cell-mediated intestinal inflammation.! !"
"9396722","Project Summary: This is a predoctoral fellowship application to support an MD/PhD trainee at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in her goal to become a physician-scientist. The proposed research aims to dissect the role of the class I histone deacetylase HDAC3 in keratinocyte-mediated innate immunity. Currently, class I HDAC inhibitors are used for the treatment of cutaneous malignancies. These drugs inhibit class I HDACs nonspecifically. The mechanisms of action of HDAC inhibitors remain unclear, and they have undesirable side effects. Elucidating the roles of specific class I HDACs in the epidermis will improve current understanding of skin biology and inform the development of improved treatment options for skin disease. The proposed studies will utilize a mouse model in which Hdac3 deletion can be induced specifically in the skin. Aim 1 will address the hypothesis that HDAC3 modulates the keratinocyte response to skin commensal bacteria. This will be achieved through in vitro keratinocyte stimulations, antibiotic treatment of mutant and control animals, and rederivation of mutant and control animals in germ-free conditions. Aim 2 will address the potential mechanisms through which HDAC3 represses innate immune signaling using a series of in vitro ChIP, co-IP and small molecule inhibitor studies. Anticipated results have the potential to inform the development of improved therapeutics for the treatment of skin cancer and skin inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis."
"9604996","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The overall goal of this three-year project is to maximize the functional recovery of patients with  above elbow amputations (AEA) by developing an intramedullary Percutaneous Osseointegrated Docking System (PODS) that is ready for translation to human clinical trials. The design of the AEA PODS will address the challenges found in above elbow residual limbs of modern day warfighters (i.e. short residual limbs, heterotopic ossification (HO), shrapnel). Background: Socket-type attachment of an exoprosthesis to the residual limb is currently the standard of care, but is not suitable for all patients. Even patients successfully fitted with sockt-type attachments can be dissatisfied since they frequently experience pain from persistent deterioration of the soft tissues resulting from poor socket fit. In addition, blast related heterotopic ossification (HO) within the soft tissues of the residual limb cause further reductions  in quality of life. It is for these kinds of patients that PODS devices are developed. There are three Specific Aims to this proposal. First, using morphological data from a pooled cadaver population with the diversity of personnel currently serving active duty for the United States, we will engineer a series of AEA PODS endoprostheses. We have a proven track record with this type of work not only with translational animal models, but also with human femurs for an upcoming FDA small feasibility clinical trial with AKA patients. In this project, we will deliver a  series of AEA PODS sufficient to achieve a 95% confidence of fitting the pooled cadaver population. Second, we will verify the endoprosthetic fit of the AEA PODS using a sample population of de-identified VA and military patients with traumatic amputations. To date, PODS have not been designed to account for the unique clinical challenges found in both the VA and the military healthcare populations. Working directly with collaborators within the VA, the WRNMMC, and the BAMC healthcare systems, we will obtain de-identified CT image sets from trauma related AEA populations. By evaluating the designed AEA PODS using a sample patient population, we will be able to verify that the designs are adequate to preserve endoprosthetic fit of this unique population. We will deliver a series of AEA PODS sufficient to achieve a 95% confidence of fitting a sample patient population. Third, we will establish the initial post-operatve fixation expectations for AEA PODS. We believe that before rehabilitation of AEA PODS patients can safely be initiated, it is imperative to determine the relationship between the measured endoprosthetic fit of the AEA PODS endoprostheses and the expected post-operative fixation. We will deliver a mathematical relationship to estimate, within 95% confidence, the initial post-operative fixation of AEA PODS given the endoprosthetic fit. Study Design: Using our established protocols used to develop endoprosthesis for previous sheep animal models and upcoming FDA Feasibility trials for AKA PODS devices, we will engineer a series of AEA PODS sufficient to achieve a 95% confidence of fitting a sample AEA patient population and develop a mathematical relationship to estimate, within 95% confidence, the initial post-operative fixation of AEA PODS given the endoprosthetic fit. Relevance: In the development of PODS devices, patients with traumatic amputations above the elbow are currently underserved. As of 02 July 2012, the number of patients from OIF/OEF with major limb amputations has reached 1,506, of which 263 (17%) suffer from upper extremity involvement. Nationally, it is estimated in 2005, of the 1.5 million persons living with limb loss in 2005, 541,000 (36%) have an upper extremity involvement. Unfortunately, rejection of socket-type exoprosthetics is especially prevalent in AEA patients. Nearly 60% of AEA patients reject the use of their socket-based exoprosthesis because of issues such as poor fit, difficulties with training, limited usefulness, and short residual limb-length."
"9398122","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vision loss in glaucoma is caused by the death of the output neurons of the retina, the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Axonal injury is an important, early insult to RGCs in glaucoma and axonal damage precedes cell body degeneration. Identifying the local axonal signaling pathways that initiate these changes is an important step in understanding glaucoma and other axonopathies. Following axonal injury, phosphorylation-dependent signal relay events are among the first changes to occur and these signals likely trigger fate-determining events in the axon and cell body. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family plays an integral role in signal transduction in response to changes in the cellular environment by integrating diverse signals arising from cellular stressors and initiating changes in gene expression. c-Jun N-terminal kinases, (JNK1-3) are MAPK family members that are known to be involved in axonal injury signaling. JNK activation is known to occur in human glaucoma patients and has been documented in various glaucoma models. We have shown that the JNKs are activated in RGC axons soon after injury and those they are important mediators of axonal injury-induced RGC death. Furthermore, we have shown that RGC death is dependent on activation of the canonical JNK substrate, the transcription factor JUN. In this application we propose a series of experiments designed to define a key axonal injury pathway-JNK signaling-in glaucomatous neurodegeneration and to test our central hypothesis: A JNK signaling pathway is a critical mediator of RGC death after axonal injury and is the signaling pathway that links axonal injury to RGC death. Specifically, we will determine: 1) the JNK dependent events that control RGC death after a glaucomatous injury; 2) whether activation of the transcription factor JUN is required for glaucomatous RGC death; and 3) the identity of the axonal injury-induced kinases that control JNK activation and axon degeneration in glaucoma. Since axonal injury and degeneration are likely to be key events in glaucoma and JNK signaling is active in glaucomatous eyes, understanding this pathway will be important for understanding the pathophysiology of glaucoma. The experiments outlined in this application will: define new molecules fundamental in the axonal injury and degeneration cascade, identify molecular events that are early in the injury signaling cascade which are ideal targets for therapeutic intervention and define the critical pathological insults that trigger axonal injury and degeneration in glaucoma."
"9403262","Project Summary/Abstract Biochemical imaging using hyperpolarized (HP) nuclei now offers the possibility of extending the inherent power of 13C NMR to rapidly image intermediary metabolism in human patients. The recent installation of a clinical polarizer in this BTRC provides the opportunity to test and validate this technology as it moves towards clinical research applications. The overall intent is to develop a good understanding of how to interpret 13C NMR spectra and images from the liver after injection of HP-[1-13C]pyruvate and other substrates. A general theme in this TR&D project is to perform conventional 2H and 13C isotopomer analysis and hyperpolarization exams in the same tissue. With this approach, standard tracer methods are used to efficiently validate and interpret the HP data. Aim 1 will focus on the utility of HP [1-13C]pyruvate for monitoring TCA cycle flux and pathways related to gluconeogenesis in a rat model. Pharmacological and nutritional interventions will be used to selectively manipulate specific aspects of liver metabolism. The sensitivity of HP data to these interventions will be tested, and critically compared to results from simultaneous 2H and 13C NMR isotopomer analysis. In Aim 2 we will investigate novel probes such as HP-[2-13C]dihydroxyacetone for imaging phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP). 13C labeled mono-esters of TCA cycle intermediates, developed in TR&D 1, will also be evaluated in vivo. With our collaborators, we have already determined that detection of HP-[1-13C]lactate, HP-[1- 13C]alanine and HP-[13C]bicarbonate from the liver is feasible in the pig. Consequently Aim 3 will test the effects of nutritional state on gluconeogenic pathways and TCA cycle flux, using conventional methods, and at the same time perform HP spectroscopy and imaging after injection of HP-[1-13C]pyruvate. Parallel experiments in the same animals with an identical protocol will be performed with [U-13C]pyruvate, not hyperpolarized, to measure the fraction of exogenous pyruvate entering the malate, lactate, alanine and acetyl- CoA pools. These methods will be extended to human subjects in Aim 4 where we will monitor metabolism of HP-[1-13C]pyruvate in the liver and evaluate the impact of simple alterations in nutritional state. The primary goal is to implement hyperpolarization exams in the human liver and to critically evaluate the metabolic information resulting from these exams."
"9407041","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac hypertrophy, a common precursor to heart failure, is a compensatory response to an increased workload characterized by myocyte growth. Hypertrophic cardiomyocytes undergo significant changes in cellular plasticity by adopting the expression profile and some phenotypic aspects of fetal cardiac cells. This phenomenon represents the molecular underpinnings driving the morphological and physiological remodeling in heart disease and likely includes both maladaptive and compensatory mechanisms aimed at mitigating disease-induced remodeling. To execute these changes in gene expression, chromatin structure must undergo significant alterations to silence or activate select regions of the genome. Recent studies in murine models of cardiac hypertrophy have demonstrated that modulating key epigenetic factors can inhibit these gene expression changes and prevent pathologic remodeling; however, our knowledge of the chromatin modifiers driving cardiac disease is quite limited. Smyd1, a myocyte-specific histone methyltransferase, was originally identified as a necessary regulator of cardiac development in constitutive Smyd1 knockout mice, which die in utero due to cardiac defects. More recently, we have shown that Smyd1 expression is differentially regulated during pressure overload hypertrophy and failure in mice (consistent with its expression in humans) and that it controls pathologic gene expression and myocyte growth in the adult heart. Most intriguing, data from isolated myocytes show that over-expression of the Smyd1a variant can inhibit disease induced remodeling, suggesting this pathway may hold promise for therapeutic targeting. Despite these findings, very little is known regarding Smyd1's molecular function in the adult myocardium. This application will leverage a unique genetic animal model and state-of-the-art proteomic and next- generation sequencing technologies to conceptually advance our understanding of heart failure. Specifically, this work will determine if Smyd1a can inhibit growth and pathologic remodeling in an animal model of hypertrophy and failure and identify the factors governing Smyd1's activity, genomic targeting and functional variance. In addition this work will conclusively determine how Smyd1 regulates growth in the myocardium by identifying the genes bound by Smyd1 variants, and investigate how binding affects transcription. This approach will reveal discrete molecular mechanisms governing pathologic growth, but moreover, it has the potential to provide paradigm changing insights into how histone methyltransferases regulate chromatin structure and thereby cardiac phenotype. Ultimately, characterizing the components of this novel, myocyte-specific signaling pathway could reveal new therapeutic targets for heart failure."

Further, yoga and self- management are effective and useful modalities for improving pain-related disability and is relevant to the mission of NCCIH. However, yoga and self-management have not been combined for the caregiving dyad. Thus, the goal of this innovative planning grant is to treat the caregiving dyad with an 8-week intervention to improve pain-related disability and health outcomes for individuals in the caregiving dyad. The Aims are: Aim 1: Develop and manualize the MY-Skills intervention. Aim 2: Assess feasibility and acceptability of MY-Skills and research procedures including planned assessments. Methods: Using focus groups, clinical reasoning, literature, and findings from previously tested interventions of yoga and self-management, we will develop, refine, and standardize the MY-Skills intervention for chronic pain. In parallel, we will develop a control group that includes exercise and health and wellness education. In a small randomized controlled trial, we will examine feasibility and acceptability of the 8-week MY-Skills procedures and intervention compared to a control group, with 30 caregiving dyads randomly assigned to the two groups (15 dyads for My-Skills and 15 dyads for control group; N = 60 participants/30 dyads). Surveys will be administered and focus groups will be conducted to understand participant satisfaction and experiences with MY-Skills. After each intervention session, interventionists, caregivers, and care recipients will rate their satisfaction with the session content and activities. Members of the caregiving dyad will complete pre and post- assessments regarding the primary outcome, pain-related disability and secondary outcome measures guided by the Biopsychosocial model including assessment of the dyadic relationship. Our primary hypothesis is that MY-Skills will be feasible and acceptable to caregiving dyads, as measured by benchmarks for recruitment, screening, attendance, and completion of assessments and intervention. Our expected outcomes include MY- Skills intervention workbooks for participants and manuals (i.e., training methods and methods to assess interventionist fidelity) for interventionists leading the MY-Skills intervention and control group."

"9391027","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application to support a new early stage investigator focuses on the role of Dectin-2 in the pathophysiology of allergen-induced pulmonary inflammation. We have previously discovered that the dendritic cell (DC) C-type lectin receptor Dectin-2 is activated by glycans found in common, clinically relevant, allergens such as the house dust mite (HDM) species Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) and the mold Aspergillus fumigatus (Af). Activation of Dectin-2 by Df, Dp, or Af triggers production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-23, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-?) and cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys- LTs). Cys-LTs produced by such activation condition DCs in an autocrine fashion to promote Th2 immune responses, via the type 1 receptor for cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs), CysLT1R. CysLT1R signaling and Th2 priming on DCs are negatively regulated by the type 2 receptor for cys-LTs, CysLT2R. These data suggest that Th2 immunity to allergens can be finely regulated by signaling from cys-LTs. The current proposal will use mouse strains with genetic mutations in classical and novel CysLTRs to understand how they influence DC activation and Th2 priming to native allergens (Aim 1). Human monocyte-derived DCs will also be assessed by using siRNA-mediated knockdown of CysLTRs. We have identified that Dectin-2 has a critical role in triggering allergic inflammation during the challenge phase and Aim 2 of the current proposal will use in vivo models of HDM sensitization and challenge to understand the role of Dectin-2 and DCs in the elicitation phase. Greater than 50% of asthma is attributable to allergy and HDM is the most common allergen worldwide. Therefore, understanding how Dectin-2 mediates sensitization and propagation of HDM-triggered immunopathology offers a MAJOR potential therapeutic benefit."
"9503158","PROJECT SUMMARY: The innate immune system is the dominant immune system found in plants, fungi, insects, and primitive multicellular organisms and comprises the cells and mechanisms that defend the host from infection. In some bacteria, the CRISPR/Cas9 system confers resistance to foreign genetic elements such as those present within plasmids and phages, and provides a form of acquired immunity. However, bacteria are also under constant threat from other bacteria, which often attack by employing a Type VI secretion system (T6SS). Bacteria can kill neighboring bacteria via the T6SS-mediated injection of toxic effectors, such as peptidoglycanases (PGases), lipases, nucleases or pore forming toxins. To date, the only known defense mechanism against T6SS-mediated attacks is by the expression of an ?anti-toxin? that recognizes and neutralizes a specific effector. In this project, we hypothesize that some bacteria have developed an ?innate immune system? that allows them to survive the attack of generic T6SS-containing bacteria without expressing specific anti-toxin proteins. We propose that this can be achieved by modifying the peptidoglycan (PG) to make it resistant to degradation by PGase effectors. Peptidoglycan is composed of an N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid disaccharide with a penta- peptide stem attached, which is then polymerized into glycan strands. These strands are crosslinked together through the peptide stems, forming a meshwork that surrounds the inner membrane. Although the composition of PG seems well-conserved among Gram-negative bacteria, modifications to limit degradation by lysozyme or to elude detection by the host organism have been reported. Our preliminary data indicate that Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) clinical isolate ATCC 17978 has modified the structure of its peptidoglycan. This modification appears to be biologically relevant as TagX, the PGase that cleaves PG in Acinetobacter to allow the assembly of its own T6SS, is able to degrade Acinetobacter but not Escherichia coli PG. In bacterial competition assays, Acinetobacter species appear to be apex predators, residing at the top of the chain with only a few other species being able to prey on them. We test the hypothesis that PG modifications increase the resistance of Ab to bacterial predators by reducing the activity of bacterial cell wall targeting effectors. Furthermore, we will determine Acinetobacter PG modifications and identify the enzymes involved. Due to the rapid increase of anti- bacterial resistance and a limited number of antibiotics currently being developed, Acinetobacter is quickly becoming a global threat to healthcare and new strategies are needed in order to combat it. Modifications to PG will not only constitute a new paradigm as an immune defense against bacterial attacks but may also provide new targets for the development of antibiotics that interfere with the assembly of the bacterial cell wall."
"9412519","Project Summary/Abstract Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a progressive and fatal disease. Sustained pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling are the major causes for the elevated PVR and PAP in IPAH patients. An increase in cytosolic Ca ([Ca ]cyt) in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC) is a major  2+ 2+ trigger for pulmonary vasoconstriction and for pulmonary vascular remodeling due to its stimulatory effect on PASMC proliferation and migration. Abnormally enhanced Ca2+ entry in PASMC because of upregulated expression of membrane receptors (e.g., CaSR) and Ca2+ channels (e.g., TRPC6/C3) contributes to the development and progression of PAH. Downregulation of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel expression and decrease in Kv currents (IK(V)) in PASMC contribute to a) increasing PASMC contraction, proliferation and migration by inducing membrane depolarization that opens voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and raises [Ca ]cyt and b) inhibiting PASMC apoptosis by attenuating apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) and maintaining 2+ high [K ]cyt to inhibit caspases. Enhanced PASMC proliferation and inhibited PASMC apoptosis both contribute  + to pulmonary vascular wall thickening. Our data show that selectively increased miRNAs are involved in posttranscriptionally downregulating Kv channels to stimulate PASMC proliferation and inhibit PASMC apoptosis in IPAH patients. Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G protein-coupled receptor that can be activated by extracellular Ca2+, is upregulated in IPAH-PASMC compared to normal PASMC. Activation of CaSR in IPAH-PASMC induces receptor-operated Ca entry (ROCE) via diacylglycerol (DAG), while IP3-mediate active 2+ depletion of Ca2+ from the SR results in store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Extracellular Ca2+-induced CaSR activation also inhibits Kv channels and activate other signal transduction pathways to induce cell proliferation. The overall goal of this research program is to continue to investigate: i) the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the posttranscriptional downregulation of Kv channels and other K+ channels by miRNAs that are enhanced in PASMC from IPAH patients; ii) the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional upregulation of CaSR and receptor-operated (ROC) and store-operated (SOC) Ca2+ channels (e.g., TRPC3/C6, TRPV1, Orai1/2 and STIM1/2) in PASMC from IPAH patients; iii) the cellular and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the CaSR-mediated functional activation of TRPC/Orai channels (and STIM1/2 oligomerization and translocation) and functional inhibition of Kv channels in PASMC from IPAH patients; and iv) the potential targets involved in the pathogenic Ca2+ signaling that can be used to develop novel therapy or combination therapy for PAH. Our laboratory has extensive research and technical experience in studying pathogenic mechanisms of IPAH and pulmonary hypertension associated with hypoxic lung disease. The forthcoming results from these studies will provide highly impactful insights into developing novel therapies for IPAH and other forms of pulmonary hypertension."
"9413486","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a heart failure syndrome that occurs in up to 50% of type 2 diabetics, and is a major contributor to mortality in this large population. This cardiomyopathy is characterized by diastolic dysfunction with hypertrophy that frequently transitions to gross systolic heart failure. Despite its clinical importance, the underlying basis of this syndrome is unknown. An important clue is that pathogenesis is strongly linked to hyperglycemia, but the absence of a pathway connecting hyperglycemia to downstream pathophysiological events has been a roadblock to progress in the field. We have discovered a new signaling pathway that may constitute an important piece of the puzzle. Hyperglycemia is known to induce the expression of Txnip (thioredoxin-interacting protein) in rodent and human hearts in vivo through a previously delineated transcriptional mechanism. Txnip has several traditional functions including (a) binding to and inhibition of thioredoxins, which are scavengers of reactive species, thereby resulting in oxidative stress; and (b) binding to and inactivation of glucose transporters, which functions as a protective mechanism during hyperglycemia. A third less studied action of Txnip is to induce apoptosis, including in cardiomyocytes, an event that could contribute to the transition from diastolic dysfunction to systolic heart failure in diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, the molecular pathway by which Txnip induces apoptosis is not known. In an unbiased proteomics screen, we found that Txnip unexpectedly interacts with Bax, an important mediator of cell death. Further, increased Txnip levels (as would be seen in diabetes) conformationally activate Bax and induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, Txnip-induced apoptosis in the mouse heart in vivo is Bax- dependent. These results define the outlines of a Txnip-Bax pathway that may provide a link between hyperglycemia and the transition to systolic heart failure in diabetic cardiomyopathy. The goals of this project are to delineate the molecular nature of this pathway and to test its rol in diabetic cardiomyopathy in vivo. Aim 1 evaluates three potential mechanisms by which Txnip activates Bax: (a) the Txnip-Bax interaction; (b) Txnip-mediated inhibition of thioredoxins, resulting in oxidative post-translational modifications of Bax that cause its activation; and (c) Txnip-mediated inhibition of glucose transporters resulting in metabolic stress and Bax-mediated cell death. Aim 2 employs inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific Txnip and Bax knockout mice to test the overall significance of the Txnip-Bax pathway in diabetic cardiomyopathy in vivo. In addition, by genetically reconstituting the hearts of Txnip and Bax knockout mice with informative Txnip and Bax mutants, this aim tests the roles of the specific molecular mechanisms linking Txnip and Bax in diabetic cardiomyopathy in vivo. Elucidation of a pathway connecting hyperglycemia to cardiomyopathy would be a highly significant advance. Moreover, these studies possess high innovation as the pathway we are proposing was not previously known. The resulting knowledge may provide a basis for future specific therapies for diabetic cardiomyopathy."
"9531151","PROJECT SUMMARY Sugar mimetics have long been known for their important biological activities. Many of them are currently used in clinics as antimicrobials (e.g., streptomycin, gentamycin, neomycin), antivirals (e.g., oseltamivir, peramivir, entecavir), and anti-diabetics (e.g., acarbose, voglibose). Among naturally-occurring sugar mimetics are the aminocyclopentitols, which contain a five-membered cyclitol unit resembling ribose (ribomimetics). However, due to their broad-spectrum toxicity and/or low production yield, none has yet been developed for clinical use. Therefore, addressing these limitations may provide new paths to the exploitation of their full potential as new drug leads. The long-term goals of this project are to understand the biosynthesis of ribomimetic natural products and to develop new ribomimetic-based drugs to combat infectious diseases. In this proposal, we will focus effort on interrogating the biosynthesis of the ribomimetic-containing antibiotic pactamycin and developing new pactamycin analogs as drug leads against bacteria, viruses, and malarial parasites. Our preliminary data suggest that formation of the pactamycin core structure involves highly unusual discrete polyketide synthases, a broad-spectrum glycosyltransferase, and a radical SAM enzyme. We also found that the tailoring pathway to pactamycin is exceptionally perplexing, due to the activity of numerous promiscuous tailoring enzymes. Furthermore, we have developed genetic, synthetic, and chemo-enzymatic strategies (involving a broad-spectrum ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) III-like protein) to produce new pactamycin analogs and other ribomimetic compounds, some of which have improved biological properties. Here, we propose to: 1) characterize the coordinate function of discrete PKS proteins and the unusual glycosylation of an acyl carrier protein (ACP)-bound polyketide intermediate; 2) decipher the mode of formation of the ribomimetic core, which is predicted to take place via a distinctive biotransformation mediated by radical chemistry; and 3) develop and test new ribomimetic antibiotics for anti-infective activities. Successful completion of this research will advance scientific knowledge and technical capability in the field, and will address the current slow pace of progress in the discovery of new anti-infective drugs, particularly antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-parasitic agents."
"9403256","Summary/Abstract: National Center for In Vivo Metabolism (EB015908) This application proposes to renew a Biomedical Technology Research Centers (BTRC) focused on the use of stable isotopes to probe metabolism in human patients. The BTRC is motivated by the strong current interest in disruptions of intermediary metabolism in high impact conditions such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cancer, congestive heart failure, diabetes and others. Although we have considerable knowledge from animal and cell models about metabolic pathways, little of this information can be used for clinical research and direct patient care because the information yield from traditional metabolic studies such as PET is so poor. Stable isotopes with detection of metabolic products by NMR are attractive because of the inherently rich information content of these exams which is far superior to alternatives. The poor inherent sensitivity of NMR is the critical obstacle to clinical translation. One solution is analysis of tissue biopsies and blood samples in high resolution analytical systems, an approach pioneered in this BTRC. Another solution is imaging and spectroscopy of hyperpolarized nuclei. There are a number of major opportunities to help translation of this technology to the clinic, including better 15N and 13C probes, improved software for simulation and data analysis, improved integration of NMR and mass spectrometry data, implementation of hyperpolarization exams in human patients, and validation of hyperpolarization results. We propose coordinated development of technologies focused on in vivo exams. Three technology research and development projects are planned, all driven by specific needs of our collaborative users. In TR&D 1, we will develop new probes tailored for 15N and 13C hyperpolarization and provide the infrastructure to understand the biological value of these probes. In TR&D 2, we will develop integrated methods for combining data from mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy exams, with the purpose of probing metabolism in small, biopsy- sized tissue samples. TR&D 3 will focus on in vivo applications of 13C NMR and creation of an infrastructure for hyperpolarization studies in human patients. The capacity to investigate imaging and spectroscopy of hyperpolarized nuclei is limited to a small handful of centers in the nation. The ability to integrate conventional analytical NMR and mass spectrometry methods with hyperpolarization exams is even less accessible. This program will leverage extraordinary institutional support for space, equipment and personnel in a combined basic research and clinical environment. This diverse user group, including the physicians, share one commonality in having a long track record of metabolic studies using conventional NMR and mass spectrometry for examining metabolism. The Center will retain its exclusive focus on metabolism and continue efforts in training young scientists."
