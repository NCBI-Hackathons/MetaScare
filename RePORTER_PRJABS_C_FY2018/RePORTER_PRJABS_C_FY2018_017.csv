"9585665","Resource for marking clones on the fly 4th chromosome For over a century, studies employing Drosophila melanogaster have resulted in significant advances in our understanding of highly conserved cellular processes and signaling systems. In the area of human health, Drosophila genetics has been an effective means for identifying disease-associated genes and for providing insights into their mechanism of action. The fourth chromosome (IV) is the final frontier for genetic analysis in Drosophila. Small and devoid of recombination IV has been largely ignored. Nevertheless, the long arm of IV contains roughly 105 genes. 55% of these genes have obvious human orthologs and 67% of the human genes have a disease association. A complete understanding of multicellularity requires the genetic analysis of mutations in these genes. Somatic and germline clones are established tools for studying the functions of lethal mutations in flies. The MARCM system for tracking clones of mutant cells he has been widely employed to study central nervous system development and adult intestinal stem cells. However, MARCM is not useable on IV due to the lack of appropriate chromosomes. As a resource for the Drosophila community whose investigators are funded by virtually all of the NIH Institutes and Centers, we propose a collaborative R21 (in response to PAR-16-141) to generate the necessary chromosomes for MARCM-IV. Our two labs are currently NIH funded for studies of TGF-? signaling and have worked together previously on the role of the Sno oncogene in TGF-? signal transduction. We will employ an innovative strategy integrating molecular methods (Crisper-Cas9) with genetics (X to autosome jumping). MARCM-IV will then be tested in studies of TGF-? signaling in the mushroom body and the enteric neurons of the larval brain. The Specific Aims of this project are: Aim1 Resource Development: To create the unique fourth chromosomes necessary for MARCM-IV. Aim2 Discovery: Proof of principal studies will utilize MARCM-IV to generate marked clones for three mutant genes. These are the TGF-? ligands activin-? and myoglianin and the Smad-interacting signal transducer dCORL (fussel in Flybase). These applications of MARCM-IV will advance our knowledge of molecular mechanisms in the TGF-? pathway, neural-glial interactions and the development/function of subesophageal neurons in the brain. The results should attract the attention of others in the Drosophila community whose interests encompass genes on IV. We will provide the MARCM-IV lines to any qualified investigator and evidence of community interest is already visible in letters appended to this proposal. Given that many of the genes on IV are conserved, new insights from MARCM-IV in flies can be readily translated into new hypotheses for normal development/physiology or diseases in humans. Looking ahead, it is likely our innovative approach can easily be expanded to an analysis of all genes on IV. The valuable community resource created by this project will be made freely available to all qualified researchers to facilitate our understanding of conserved features of developmental signaling and neurobiology impacting human health and disease.  "
"9498422","ABSTRACT Maximizing access and minimizing costs of delivery are key challenges for optimizing the public health impact of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-1 prevention. In Africa, PrEP will be added to an already-burdened health infrastructure and the ability of public health systems to afford PrEP will necessitate making its delivery cost-effective and time-efficient. PrEP delivery programs will be cost-sensitive to staffing needs (e.g., frequent clinic visits), and patients may not continue PrEP if the opportunity costs (e.g., travel to and waiting in clinics) are high. HIV-1 testing is central to PrEP delivery: testing at-risk persons is the first step for PrEP initiation and ongoing HIV-1 testing is essential for PrEP delivery. Like PrEP, HIV-1 self-testing is a new innovation and its opportunities to improve HIV-1 prevention have not yet been fully realized. We hypothesize that HIV-1 self- testing could be used to streamline PrEP delivery ? specifically through decreasing the frequency of PrEP follow- up clinic visits by having self-tests at home replace clinic-based testing. New whole blood-based HIV-1 self- testing kits are potentially more affordable than oral fluid tests and may result in greater patient and provider confidence. With a multidisciplinary collaborative team, we propose to address key access and cost of delivery challenges for PrEP by using the new modality of HIV-1 self-testing. We will conduct an individually-randomized trial using a non-inferiority design among 495 women and men in Kenya initiating PrEP who will be randomly assigned to either: quarterly clinic visits with in-clinic blood-based HIV-1 testing (standard of care arm) or six- monthly clinic visits with HIV-1 self-testing at home for quarters between clinic visits (self-testing arm); those assigned to self-testing will be assigned to either oral fluid-based or blood-based testing. The population will include heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant couples (n=165 with HIV-1 uninfected men and n=165 with HIV-1 uninfected women) and HIV-1 uninfected women at risk (n=165). The outcomes at 6 and 12 months will be PrEP adherence (PrEP detection in blood samples and persistence in obtaining refills), completion of HIV-1 testing, and safety (including side effects and social harm). We will integrate mixed-methods work to understand user experiences, preferences, provider options, barriers, and facilitators related to HIV-1 self-testing within the PrEP context, to explore impressions of the two self-testing modalities (blood and oral fluid), and to consider the effect of gender and couple status on our findings. Finally, we will also use microcosting and mathematical modeling to assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of HIV-1 self-testing to optimize PrEP delivery. Combining self-testing and PrEP brings together two cutting-edge interventions, and the simple HIV-1 self-testing strategy in this application could improve PrEP?s cost-effectiveness, reach, and impact without sacrificing HIV-1 protection and safety. Given the time-sensitive nature of this question, and leveraging our experience, we propose to conduct this work in 3.5 years."
"9413920","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To preserve the integrity of their genomic DNA, eukaryotic cells utilize a variety of surveillance mechanisms known as checkpoint controls. For example, during cell duplication, cells must make sure that they have replicated their DNA accurately. To cope with the challenges of copying the DNA precisely and rectifying any problems that arise in the process, cells utilize a myriad of regulatory proteins. In vertebrates, the kinase ATR acts as a pivotal regulator in the mechanisms that detect problems with DNA replication and enable cells to address such defects. A key feature of this kinase is that it undergoes precisely regulated activation upon genomic perturbation. Accordingly, this activation involves elaborate control mechanisms. For example, a binding partner known as ATRIP helps to recruit the ATR-ATRIP complex to RPA-coated regions of single-stranded DNA, which are characteristic of numerous detrimental DNA lesions. However, the ATR- ATRIP complex still remains weakly active upon associating with RPA on the DNA. At some point thereafter, ATR-ATRIP interacts with another protein called TopBP1. This binding results in a massive increase in the kinase activity of ATR and represents the culmination of numerous steps that trigger activation of a checkpoint response. Past studies have indicated that the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) complex plays a role in controlling the interaction of TopBP1 with ATR-ATRIP. However, many aspects of this overall process have remained nebulous. It has also been unclear whether activation of ATR occurs solely through this route in animal cells.  We have recently observed that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex plays a novel role in the activation of ATR in response to aberrant DNA replication. The MRN complex had been best known for its role in another type of checkpoint mechanism, namely, the response to double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). In the upcoming grant period, a variety of studies will be carried out to elucidate the mechanism by which MRN collaborates with TopBP1 and other checkpoint control proteins to promote the activation of ATR. A systematic series of experiments will be conducted to explore: (1) how the nuclease activity of MRN affects checkpoint induction at replication forks; (2) how MRN and TopBP1 interact with one another and with replication forks during the checkpoint response; and (3) how these steps ultimately lead to the activation of ATR. Moreover, searches will be undertaken for novel regulators in these pathways. These studies will be performed with both Xenopus egg extracts and human tissue culture cells. This strategy will capitalize upon the complementary advantages of each experimental system. Overall, these studies will exploit new perspectives on checkpoint signaling and hence promise to uncover original insights into the mechanisms that safegaurd genomic integrity. This information would be invaluable for understanding how cells forestall cancer-promoting mutations and other disease-inducing genetic abnormalities."
"9504809","ABSTRACT Functional pain syndromes affect over 100 million people, yet remain ineffectively treated because the causes are largely unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that these syndromes are due, in large part, to reduced activity of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines. An estimated 66% of patients with functional pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, possess variants in the COMT gene that lead to low activity of the COMT enzyme. Individuals with the ?low COMT activity? genotype report greater pain at baseline and enhanced pain following stressful events that potentiate catecholamine release from sympathetic nerves. Consistent with clinical syndromes, our lab has shown that pharmacologic inhibition of COMT in rodents produces pain at multiple body sites and enhanced pain following repeated stress. In subsequent studies, we demonstrated that COMT-dependent pain is initiated by the peripheral adrenergic receptor ?3 (Adrb3) through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF? and IL-6), and maintained by subsequent increases in TNF? and activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in spinal cord neurons. Together, these data show that heightened catecholamine tone leads to persistent pain via peripheral Adrb3 and its downstream effectors. In the periphery, Adrb3 is primarily expressed on adipocytes, which are fat cells that surround peripheral nociceptor and sympathetic nerve terminals and control immune responses. Preliminary data reveal that COMT-dependent increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines are mediated by adipocyte Adrb3. Additional data reveal that sustained activation of Adrb3 leads to decreased levels of miR-133a, a microRNA expressed in adipocytes that negatively regulates cytokines and MAPKs. These data indicate that activation of adipocyte Adrb3 may drive chronic COMT-dependent pain via miR-133a-dependent increases in cytokines and MAPKs. However, the direct contribution of adipocyte Adrb3 and miR-133a to pain is not known. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to create unique tools that we can use to define the role of Adrb3 and miR-133a in chronic pain. First, we will generate an inducible adipocyte-specific Adrb3 knockout mouse to determine the contribution of adipocyte Adrb3 to the onset and maintenance of COMT-dependent pain in the absence or presence of stress. Next, we will generate an adipocyte-specific miR-133a viral construct to determine the ability of miR-133a to resolve COMT-dependent pain in the absence or presence of stress. Results from these studies will provide new insights into the peripheral mechanisms that drive chronic pain, and elucidate new targets for the development of peripherally-restricted therapies with improved specificity and side-effect profiles for the treatment of functional pain syndromes."
"9405022","The BioCAT Biotechnology Research Resource operates X-ray beamline 18ID at the Advanced Photon  Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Now in its 20th year of operation, it is a mature, productive facility with  many capabilities unique in the USA, and, arguably, the world. Going forward, we intend to maintain our world-  class capabilities in static, time- and spatially-resolved fiber diffraction with beamline enhancements for  increased flux and beam quality. A novel high speed, high sensitivity, high spatial resolution pixel array  detector will provide an excellent match to the needs of our muscle diffraction program. Also proposed is a  versatile micro-diffraction/micro-SAXS instrument that can use one of two Compound Refractive Lenses  optimized for either wide- or small-angle fiber crystallography, and continuous flow SAXS experiments. We will  implement multimodal scanning micro-diffraction, x-ray florescence microscopy, phase contrast and uv/visible  imaging that can be done either singly or in combination with the same instrument on the same samples.  Developments in time-resolved SAXS will extend available time regimes from 500 ns to seconds with major  reductions in sample consumption, by more than order of magnitude, from current capabilities. This will allow  a much wider range of biomedical problems to be addressed than previously possible. A new beamline data  acquisition and control system will provide a common interface and better data management for all  experiments and advanced support for time resolved experiments. Combined refractive index, dynamic light  scattering and multi-angle light scattering measurements with SAXS will offer more comprehensive sample  characterization on-line for more robust results. A multi-scale modeling effort will allow extracting more  information from muscle X-ray diffraction studies. The proposed developments in multi-scale simulations for  interpreting single molecule SAXS data will profoundly benefit studies of multicomponent systems that show  considerable conformational heterogeneity. Our relationship with the CCP-SAS project will enable us to widely  disseminate the advanced modeling tools we create to not only all our DBP's, collaborative and service users  but to the wider biomedical community. Our Driving Biomedical Projects, collaborative, and service projects  have relevance to basic mechanisms of muscle function, heart disease, retinitis pigmentosa, cancer and  neuro-degenerative diseases. Our proposed training activities are designed to ensure safe, efficient and  productive use of the resource by our users. Our proposed dissemination activities are designed to grow our  user community by keeping targeted biomedical communities well-informed of resource capabilities."
"9509748","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Schistosomiasis is a chronically debilitating disease caused by parasitic schistosome worms infecting over 200 million people resulting in over 280,000 deaths annually due to complications from the disease. Schistosome larvae, cercariae, exit freshwater snail species and burrow into human skin through the use of proteases that degrade skin proteins. Afterwards they transform into schistosomula, enter the bloodstream, eventually arriving at the mesenteric veins where the adult worms eat red blood cells, pair, and lay hundreds of eggs daily. Although schistosomes have been studied more than 150 years, we know little of the molecular regulators that modulate the development of cercariae to schistosomula and the adaptation from free-swimming parasites to blood-dwelling worms. This proposal will identify the unidentified and uncharacterized initial regulators of development found static in cercariae and develop a comprehensive timeline of the developmental progression from cercariae to schistosomula. These data will provide clues to begin to further explore the mechanisms for the developmentally regulated translational control of the schistosome life cycle that may be conserved in other organisms."
"9398909","DESCRIPTION:      Background: Traumatic brain injury has been referred to as the signature injury of the Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) wars. Over 25,000 soldiers were diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in 2012 alone. Not only do soldiers have blast-related mTBI, estimates of comorbid Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), range from 11% to 50%. Since neural mechanisms affected by mTBI and PTSD often are overlapping, it is suggested that mTBI and PTSD may have an additive effect on symptoms. Indeed, an estimated 44-50% of soldiers with mTBI/PTSD remain symptomatic after one-year, compared to an estimated 10% in sports related concussion. Both mTBI and PTSD are associated with deficits in executive functioning. Additional factors that accompany mTBI in combat Veterans are depression and sleep deficits. Consequently, the combination of all these factors, impact executive functions and result in combat Veterans who are struggling to live productive lives. An effective treatment of executive function is needed for  Veterans diagnosed with mTBI. Goal Management Training (GMT) is a metacognitive intervention that has been validated in TBI. However, limitations in GMT studies raise questions regarding effectiveness of GMT in mTBI. Based on preliminary data, GMT improved significantly on a problem solving measure in Veterans with blast-related mTBI, but lacked transfer to everyday activities. Therefore, we developed a Smartphone application to enhance the transfer of GMT skills to everyday tasks. The purpose: of this randomized study is to determine the effect of an innovative treatment for executive functions, enhanced with Smartphone technology, in Veterans with multiple blast related mTBI. In addition to determining the overall benefit of GMT, the study will investigate the influence of comorbid factors, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, sleep disorders and cognitive capacity. Method: Veterans diagnosed with repeat blast-related mTBI and executive function deficit will be recruited from two sites (Tampa and North Florida/South Georgia) by Speech Services. Veterans will be randomized to GMT (38 participants) or to a control treatment called Brain Health Workshop (BHW) (16 participants).The Tower of London, a measure of planning and problem solving will be used to determine response to treatment. Primary analysis will use two sample t-test to compare group A (intervention) and group B (control) on improvements in time to completion on the TOL. In addition, as an exploratory analysis, we will perform a regression analysis that includes treatment group, PTSD severity and their interaction as independent variables, to adjust for PTSD severity measured by Clinician Administered PTSD Scale and to investigate whether there is interaction between treatment group and PTSD severity. Additional, exploratory tertiary analysis using paired t-tests will determine whether treatment effect generalizes to executive function performance in everyday activities (BRIEF-A) or engagement in community participation (CRIS). To test the second specific aim, a general linear regression will be used to determine whether factors such as PTSD, sleep, depression or cognitive capacity is associated with response to treatment. Results: If the results support the hypothesis that GMT will improve executive functions than this cognitive intervention can be adapted to a tele-health method of delivery and tested in a larger clinical trial. Moreover, the influence of the four factors on response to treatment, can guide future studies to determine which patients are likely to benefit from GMT."
"9571403","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The University of California Preclinical Animal Study Site (UC PASS) is a collaborative effort between UC Davis and UC San Diego that brings together the scientific expertise, state of the art technologies and facilities, and institutional support to achieve the primary objectives goals of the PASS, which are to: 1) develop animal models that best complement the endurance and resistance training protocols used in the human trials, and 2) provide organ and tissue samples collected at multiple time points after both acute and chronic exercise for analysis by the Chemical Analysis Sites. The animal studies to be undertaken by the PASS will begin to elucidate the molecular pathways responsible for the acute and chronic effects of both endurance and resistance exercise on individual organs, as well as identify the interactions between organs; the goal being to understand the mechanisms by which different modes of physical activity impart their health benefits. In order to reach this goal, experts in model development and phenotyping of the resulting muscle and global health adaptations will be essential. The UC PASS team has exactly these traits. The team acknowledges that the ultimate animal model and exercise tests to be utilized in the PASS will be determined by the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Common (MoTrPAC) Steering Committee. In this application we provide a strong rationale and justification for the use of the rat as the animal model and propose specific endurance and resistance exercise programs to be used in Phase I of the PASS, highlighting the major advantages and limitations of each paradigm. In Phase II of the PASS we build on the models established in Phase I and propose three specific aims to begin to produce a standard curve of molecular transducers versus adaptive response to exercise. In Phase II we propose to exercise animals of increasing age or increasing adiposity, determine the adaptive response to 12 weeks of training, and relate this with the acute molecular transducer response to exercise. With this secondary screen, we will be able to identify molecular transducers that directly correlate with the local or global health benefits of exercise. We will then use this information to test the genetic requirement for these molecular transducers for the health benefits of exercise. The UC PASS is composed of an exceptional team of primary investigators and key collaborators/advisors with expertise in the development of animal models of exercise, the molecular response to exercise, and applied human exercise interventions. This team will provide leadership and the necessary skill sets to successfully model human exercise in animals, which is essential to the success of the MoTrPAC Common Fund and achievement of its goal: to define and understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the human health benefits of physical activity."
"9454820","Data Management and Bioinformatics Core Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. In spite of active research in this area, a generalize multi-scale solution that can support a systems biology approach to clinical problems remains elusive. This is not surprising, given that a general solution effectively requires modeling all of biology and medicine simultaneously. Even though a general solution may be intractable, we believe that substantial progress can be made by focusing on the clinical, genomic, and pathogen data for a single condition, Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP). The overall goal of the Data Management and Bioinformatics (DMBI) Core is to develop and implement new and enhanced computational resources that support a systems biology approach to HAP, and to share those resources broadly. The DMBI Core will sit at the nexus of SCRIPT where it will provide the tools, methods, skills and infrastructure to collect, integrate, transform, analyze and distribute the diverse data generated by both projects. The design and implementation of the DMBI Core is based on the premise that genome-centric approaches and phenome-centric approaches are both inherently scientifically limiting. Rather, a systems biology approach that gives equal weight to all data types is more likely to produce significant findings. Achieving the broader goals of this project will require the seamless integration of clinical data with molecular profiling data on both host and pathogen. We will leverage our extensive experience in the integration of EHR and genomic data to design a novel graph- based repository. The multiple sources of genomic data will be integrated with clinical phenomic data extracted from the continuous stream of data that populates the EHR in patients in the intensive care unit. We will utilize the data sets generated in Aim 1 for further analysis of the gene regulatory networks using both novel computation tools and novel uses of existing tools. In particular, we will develop tailor- made algorithms for an integrative analysis of multiple omics data sets that enable modeling of the underlying gene regulatory networks. A multi-pronged approach to dissemination will be employed. Datasets and metadata will be archived in the appropriate NIAID and/or NCBI archives. Computational tools will be distributed through a GitHub repository. Of greater long term value will be the creation of a secure, interactive web portal that will allow research to interact with the study data repository to not only browse and filter data based on a rich section of attributes, but also to run analysis directly."
"9404469","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gatlinburg Conference on Research in ID/DD is an annual scientific meeting designed to advance translational biobehavioral research on intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The meeting provides a forum for investigators at all career stages to present and discuss cutting-edge biobehavioral research and theory. The conference focuses on the causes, consequences, and treatments for specific disorders, as well as on the processes underlying IDD more generally. Each year's conference has a scientific theme that is explored through plenary lectures, but the theme does not constrain the symposia or poster sessions, which span a broad range of topics, from basic to translational and applied science. The themes are designed to expose participants to theoretical frameworks, methods, and findings from other disciplines and fields of study, including from basic and translational neuroscience, as well as fields focused on cultural influences on development and IDD. Thus, the specific aims of the Gatlinburg Conference are: (1) Promote the exchange of scientific findings, theoretical perspectives, and methodological innovations and thereby accelerate, and encourage innovation in, translational research on IDD. (2) Facilitate collaborative interdisciplinary research on IDD. (3) Ensure that biobehavioral scientists are exposed to relevant translational and basic science findings, methods, and perspectives from neurobiology and medicine, thereby enriching their research and further supporting interdisciplinarity. (4) Serve as an interdisciplinary training and career development resource for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. (5) Increase the diversity of IDD research by supporting the development of early career scientists from under-represented groups. Although these aims are largely unchanged from the previously funded application, we propose several innovations in the conference in present application to ensure increased success in achieving those aims."
"9448233","Obese patients have an increased risk of arrhythmias and twice the risk of sudden cardiac death, which is often caused by ventricular tachycardias (VT). Cardiomyocytes from obese patients have increased lipid content, which is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of arrhythmia. Furthermore, higher levels of serum fatty acids and higher saturated fat intake in the diet predict sudden cardiac death. This suggests that the arrhythmogenic effects of saturated fat can occur without obesity. An unanswered question is: What are the molecular mechanisms causing arrhythmias during obesity and high-fat diet?  The most common electrophysiologic abnormalities found in obese patients are increased frequency of ventricular ectopy and prolongation of the QT interval. We have previously shown that wild type (WT) mice with high-fat diet induced obesity (DIO) have long QT and increased ventricular ectopy, mimicking the abnormalities found in obese humans. Our preliminary data now show that a high saturated fat diet is sufficient to cause ventricular ectopy and prolong the QT interval, and to promote inducibility of VT/VF. Further, mice fed a diet with an equivalent amount of monounsaturated fat from olive oil do not have heart rhythm abnormalities. We discovered that a high saturated fat diet increases cardiac NAPDH oxidase 2 (NOX2) activity, whereas the olive oil high-fat diet does not. The NOX2 inhibitor apocynin, when given during a high saturated fat diet, prevents heart rhythm abnormalities. Additional experiments with isolated cardiac myocytes show that NOX2 is necessary for the oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by saturated fat. We will use both in vivo experiments and cardiomyocytes to determine the pathways linking cardiac lipid metabolism to arrhythmia. Our central hypothesis is that NOX2 activation causes the arrhythmogenic effect of saturated fat by causing sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak, which in turn promotes mitochondrial dysfunction.  We propose the following independent aims: 1. Determine if NOX2 activation causes arrhythmia during high fat diet, by using genetic gain and loss. 2. Determine how TLR4 signaling contributes to the arrhythmogenic effects of dietary saturated fat. 3. Determine if the mitochondrial abnormalities caused by NOX2 activation promote arrhythmia."
"9399649","IMMUNOLOGY CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY The Immunology Core will be co-directed by Andrew Luster and Shiv Pillai. A variety of services will be provided by the Core. These include a number of novel and powerful approaches that can be applied to human immunology, for which the Core offers protocols, education, and bioinformatics analysis. In addition to these more innovative approaches, the Core also continues to provide access to established technologies such as high-speed cell sorting and cytokine assays. The services are organized into three major categories: (1) education and training, (2) routine immunology tools, and (3) specialized immunology services. By assisting investigators in developing assays and offering access to both standard techniques and a number of newly developing, powerful immunologic techniques, this core is fundamentally necessary for a number of studies pursued by CSIBD investigators and advanced trainees ready to emerge as independent investigators. The specific aims of Immunology Core are to (1) provide CSIBD members with access to immunological resources that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive to individual researchers; (2) offer CSIBD investigators access to cutting-edge immunological techniques that are at the forefront of immunology research; and (3) promote the development of junior investigators and foster collaborations by providing a connection point between investigators of varying research approaches."
"9431520","Abstract I am seeking an R35 to address the fundamental issue of how right and left shifts in the O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve influence oxygen transport in humans. I am also proposing to translate key findings to the treatment of diseases with specific defects in the O2 transport cascade like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and/or congestive heart failure. I am also proposing reverse translation from observations in patients to more basic studies on O2 delivery and mitochondrial function. Hemoglobin is one of the sentinel molecules responsible for the concept of ?molecular medicine?. A central element of this paradigm is that when the properties of the foundational molecular components of a system are understood, then more complex systems phenomenon will be explained. However, ?well-established? concepts about hemoglobin and whole body oxygen transport are contradictory and deserve further scrutiny. The standard teaching is that in response to hypoxia, there is an acute right shift in the O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve via the actions of 2,3-DPG. This right shift facilitates the off-loading of oxygen at the tissues and protects against tissue hypoxia. However, species adapted to high altitude via evolution have left shifted O2 hemoglobin dissociation curves. This suggests that during hypoxia, loading more oxygen at the lung and relying on low tissue PO2 to maintain oxygen transport is a better overall solution to the challenge of hypoxia. These divergent observations indicate there is a complex set of context-dependent physiological ?trade-offs? associated with shifts in O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve and O2 delivery. In this application, I propose studying patients at the Mayo Clinic with rare right and left shifted hemoglobin variants as unique ?experiments in nature? that will allow exploration of these trade-offs. Patient studies will be augmented with studies in healthy volunteers using repurposed drugs that cause right and left shifts of the O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve. Insight from these studies will then be translated to clinical populations. If tissue oxygenation is maintained in humans with left shifted curves, then drugs that cause a left shift might be useful in patients with pulmonary diffusion limitation. This would permit such patients to better oxygenate their blood at the lung with a lower FiO2 and reduced work of breathing. Likewise, there is chronic tissue hypoxia in congestive heart failure that might be reduced by drugs that cause a right shift in the O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve. These changes in O2 delivery might also evoke long term changes in muscle mitochondrial function that will suggest follow-up reverse translation mechanistic studies. Importantly, I am uniquely qualified to explore these ideas because of my: 1) access to unique patients, 2) experience in drug re-purposing, 3) expertise in cardiorespiratory physiology, and 4) technical ability to measure essentially every element of the O2 transport cascade in humans. Finally, because the R35 mechanism is designed to promote flexibility and risk taking by the PI, it is ideal to pursue this big issue and the bi-directional translational opportunities that will flow from the experimental approach I have proposed."
"9523828","PROJECT SUMMARY Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) kills more people yearly than any other infection. Mtb is successful because it impairs key functions of macrophages and dendritic cells. Mtb survives in macrophages by preventing the normal maturation of the phagosome, creating a replicative niche that resembles an early endosome. By impairing MHC class II (MHCII) antigen presentation, Mtb undermines CD4+ T cell recognition of infected macrophages. A detailed understanding of how Mtb undermines these processes is lacking. We found that the Mtb secreted proteins, EsxG and EsxH, play a critical role in both processes. EsxG and EsxH are secreted as a heterodimer (EsxG-EsxH). We identified a host target of EsxG-EsxH: hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS/HRS). HRS is a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. ESCRT plays a well-described role in trafficking cell surface receptors to the lysosome for degradation. We also found that ESCRT is required for phagosome maturation and optimal antigen presentation. Therefore, by inhibiting ESCRT, EsxG-EsxH can promote Mtb survival in multiple ways. Now, our new preliminary data suggest that EsxG-EsxH also targets oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL). OCRL is an inositol 5-phosphatase with substrate specificity for phosphatidlylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. Like HRS, OCRL is involved in endosome and phagosome function. The central hypothesis of this grant is that EsxG-EsxH impairs the function of both OCRL and HRS, thereby blocking phagosome maturation, inhibiting antigen presentation, and promoting Mtb virulence. We propose that EsxG-EsxH impairs recruitment of both OCRL and HRS to mycobacterial phagosomes. In the case of OCRL, we hypothesize that EsxG blocks the ability of OCRL to interact with its endosomal binding partner. In the case of HRS, we hypothesize that EsxG-EsxH promote HRS ubiquitination, which locks the molecule in an inactive form. We will determine whether EsxG-EsxH inhibits OCRL, define how it impairs HRS, and test the contribution of both EsxG-EsxH targets to infection in vivo. Our previous work on this project makes us uniquely qualified to carry out these studies. Our findings will provide further important mechanistic insight into Mtb's virulence strategies. We will also elucidate the importance of OCRL and ESCRT in basic macrophage biology. Revealing the fundamental basis by which Mtb sabotages host cellular functions will lead to better therapies and vaccines for Mtb."
"9470396","Project Summary Embryonic patterning requires intercellular signaling pathways that trigger molecular switches to precisely control cell fates. One fundamental step in development is patterning the body axes. Animal anterior-posterior patterning requires the Wnt pathway, which acts through the transcription factor (TF) TCF and its coactivator ?- catenin. Much is known about how classic targets of this pathway are transcriptionally activated in response to Wnt. Wnt induces nuclear accumulation of ?-catenin, which complexes with TCF and converts it from a transcriptional repressor to an activator. Many targets, however, are instead repressed by Wnt, and the mechanisms for this repression are less well understood. Wnt can induce expression of transcriptional repressors, leading to indirect target repression, but emerging evidence from mouse, Drosophila, and C. elegans has identified direct ?opposite? targets, activated by TCF alone and repressed by TCF:?-catenin in response to signaling. The C. elegans embryo is an ideal system to define regulatory mechanisms of these opposite Wnt targets. Almost all cell divisions are patterned by Wnt; after each cell division the posterior sister cell has high Wnt pathway activity, and the anterior sister cell has the Wnt pathway inactive. Our laboratory has identified dozens of genes expressed specifically in either anterior or posterior sister cell-derived lineages and showed that the posterior sister-specific genes are classic Wnt targets, activated when Wnt is active and repressed when Wnt is inactive. My preliminary data indicate that many genes expressed in anterior sister cells are regulated by the Wnt pathway and I propose to test the hypothesis that these genes are direct opposite Wnt targets. I will first test if POP-1/TCF, SYS-1/ ?-catenin, and Wnt ligands and receptors are necessary for proper activation or repression of each of five anterior-specific genes and identify the enhancers controlling their expression. I will identify sites bound by POP-1 throughout the genome, and test whether any are necessary for proper expression of the same five opposite Wnt targets as well as genome-wide. For targets without POP-1 binding, suggesting indirect regulation by Wnt-regulated repressors, I will combine detailed cis- regulatory analysis of their enhancers with our catalog of lineage-specific TF and classic Wnt target expression to identify anterior genes indirectly regulated by Wnt through transcriptional repressors. This work will test whether direct regulation by TCF is a common mechanism for regulation of opposite Wnt targets in C. elegans, will begin to identify mechanisms for this regulation, and will inform future work in this and other systems."
"9454824","Project Summary Project 2: Pathogen and Microbiome Temporal Changes During Resolution of HAP Severe pneumonia is a dreaded complication among mechanically ventilated patients and is associated with high rates of mortality. To better understand these challenging infections, we propose to develop the Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center. The overall goal of SCRIPT Research Project 2 is to create a computational model based on microbial biosignatures that predicts clinical failure in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Specific pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are particularly problematic in ventilator-associated pneumonia and are associated with clinical failure rates as high as 50%, even in patients treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy. For this reason, we will focus on pneumonia caused by these pathogens. Work from our group and others has shown that strains of these bacteria differ dramatically in their ability to cause severe infections. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that alterations in the pulmonary microbiome induced by pathogens or by the antibiotics used to treat them may contribute to poor clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that specific genetic biosignatures of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii and other spp. and particular alterations to the pulmonary microbiome are associated with clinical failure in patients with HAP. To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following aims: Aim 1. We will identify genetic biosignatures of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii strains associated with poor clinical responses in patients with severe pneumonia. Aim 2. We will identify pulmonary microbiome constituents (bacteria, viruses, and fungi) and longitudinal microbiome patterns associated with poor clinical responses in patients with severe pneumonia. Aim 3. Generate a computational model that integrates pathogen genome, pathogen transcriptome, and microbiome components to predict the clinical response in severe pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii. The data we generate will be used in an iterative manner to create and optimize a computational model that identifies patients at risk for clinical failure based upon the microbiology of their pneumonia. Highly discriminatory microbiological biosignatures for clinical failure will be further examined to determine whether they play a causal role in the progression of pneumonia."
"9527221","PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate. My career goal is to improve the detection and management options for disseminated infectious diseases through investigation of host-microbe interactions. I plan to pursue this with a tenure-track appointment as junior faculty with significant protected time for basic research. In the short term, my goal is to broaden my skills as an investigator and build the foundation for my transition to independent research. The education aspects of this proposal center around experimental mycology and gene expression analysis, new skills which will enable me to improve our understanding of disseminated fungal infections from both host and pathogen perspectives. Research. Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is a devastating disease most common in the immunocompromised, such as AIDS or transplant patients. The brain infection is very difficult to treat and can occur months or even years after the initial exposure?often an unnoticed pulmonary infection. Thus, the fungus is thought to exist in a quiescent state for long periods in healthy individuals, and while in this state does not appear to be susceptible to antifungal treatment. A better understanding of the quiescent state, how it is initiated and maintained, should provide us with better detection and management tools and give us the chance to manage this quiescent infection before it causes a deadly disease.  The zebrafish larva as a model host allows direct monitoring of microbial pathogenesis in vivo. In contrast to findings in cell culture models, in the zebrafish we find that inoculated Cryptococcus can have multiple fates, including clearance, replication and dissemination, or quiescence within phagocytes. This quiescent state, which can last for as long as long as the larva is viable, is common after spore infection but rare when larvae are inoculated with the yeast form. I will use spore infection as a model for early quiescent infection. The proposed experiments are designed to define the features of the host response that allow for persistence, and to define the state of cryptococcal cells that induce this response. Career Development Plan. During the proposed research period, my primary goal will be to carry forward my previous work in innate immunity to cryptococcal infection while adding considerations of fungal biology to my approach to the disease. I will also obtain new training in gene expression analysis, biostatistics and fungal biology through mentoring, hands-on bench research and didactic learning. Along with this I plan to develop new skills in leadership, mentoring and management to enable my transition to independence. I plan to coordinate my research and training activities to build toward a successful R01 application in the fourth year of the award. Environment. I will be well supported in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The institution is replete with a scientific and medical faculty of diverse backgrounds and interests, and the infrastructure for computing, biotechnology, laboratory animal care and microscopy are excellent."
"9418526","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new black box warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop intelligent NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"9424477","Abstract  Annual epidemics of influenza cause substantial morbidity in the US with up to 40,000 deaths/year and many hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient visits, and costs. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends annual influenza vaccination for all people above 6 months of age. However, less than half of all Americans receive the influenza vaccine.  Two sets of interventions that can improve influenza vaccination rates include patient reminders (generally by mail or phone), and enhancing access and ease of obtaining the vaccine. However, due to resource limitations and difficulty scaling up reminders, only a small proportion of practices or health systems remind patients about the need for vaccination, and few systems implement innovative strategies to ease access to influenza vaccination.  A technological breakthrough that might overcome these barriers is the electronic health records patient portal. Patient portals are secure, web-based communication systems, embedded within electronic health records (EHRs), allowing patients and providers to communicate via email and the internet. Portal-based reminder has the potential to raise vaccination rates for several reasons: the messages come from the patient's provider, portal reminders are easily scalable, portal messages can be personalized by drawing on information found in the patient's medical record, and portals can facilitate access by helping patients schedule their own appointments for vaccination.  This study will implement and evaluate a portal reminder system for influenza vaccination across a large UCLA-wide health system that serves >275,000 patients in 49 primary care practices, half of whom use the portal. For Aim 1 we will adapt algorithms, educational messages, and protocols previously used for mailed or phone influenza vaccine reminder/recall to create a patient portal research platform. For Aim 2, we will assess the impact of portal reminders, and key design features of these reminders, on influenza vaccination rates and costs using 3 sequential RCTs over 3 flu seasons. RCT #1 will test the optimal number of portal reminders (3, 2, or 1 vs. 0). RCT #2 will test the additional benefit of adding patient direct appointment scheduling to the portal reminder system. RCT #3 will test the additional benefit of linking portal reminders with the EHR to customize portal messages. For Aim 3 we will develop an adoption guide/toolkit for use by other health systems. We will disseminate the portal reminder system in a network of Los Angeles Department Health community health centers serving more than 30,000 low-income patients.  By study end we will have an advanced influenza vaccine portal reminder system, ready for dissemination."
"9561963","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Novel next-generation sequencing assay for monitoring multidrug resistant tuberculosis treatment in the setting of HIV infection Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a worsening global public health crisis and critical barrier to achieving TB elimination during our lifetimes. Current treatment of MDR-TB requires long treatment courses of decades-old, toxic, and poorly efficacious second-line drugs. In the setting of HIV co-infection, in particular, treatment of MDR-TB is complicated by extraordinary pill burden, overlapping drug toxicities, poor drug absorption, and often results in high early mortality. The extent of second-line anti-TB drug resistance during treatment is a strong predictor of poor outcome, but such resistance is only detected by existing molecular tests when it is already well-established. Evidence from our preliminary studies and others? suggest that small resistant M. tuberculosis (M.tb) subpopulations may be common precursors to clinical resistance. Detection and monitoring of micro-heteroresistance (<5% of total M.tb population, beneath the threshold for commonly used TB molecular tests) could transform clinical management through individualized treatment regimens and prompt reassessment of ineffective treatments (i.e., sub-therapeutic drug levels or inadequate regimens). Tremendous financial and scientific resources are directed toward investigation of new drugs for MDR-TB, but efforts to optimize and shorten treatment are hindered significantly by a poor understanding of exposure-response relationships for each drug within multi-drug regimens and how to best identify those patients who will respond inadequately to treatment. Our goal in proposing this work is to comprehensively characterize the pharmacologic correlates of M.tb micro-heteroresistance, and to determine the extent to which detection of micro- heteroresistance improves clinicians? ability to predict those MDR-TB patients, with and without HIV co-infection, who are at especially high likelihood for poor outcome. In order to achieve our Aims, we will leverage the infrastructure established through two major MDR-TB clinical trials, an existing NIH/NIAID R01 award, and the coordinated efforts of a large international non-profit organization whose mission is to enable development and delivery of diagnostic tests for poverty-related diseases."
"9466216","Abstract The goal of this SBIR FastTrack application is to deliver an augmented reality (AR) platform technology that displays an interactive 3D cardiac hologram to make ablation procedures simpler and safer. World-wide, cardiac ablations are used as therapy for ~1 million arrhythmia patients every year. There is, however, significant skill required to perform these procedures and only a handful of cases can be performed per facility, per day. By using AR to provide an interactive, shareable, patient-specific cardiac model, we will make ablation procedures simpler. By simplifying the procedure, physician performance is improved by allowing them to more quickly and thoroughly understand electroanatomic relationships, making complicated ablation procedures more tractable and improving efficiency and efficacy. Shortening procedures, reducing anesthesia time, radiation exposure and time wearing lead aprons will make procedures safer."

Sumit Chanda, Project Leader; Megan Shaw, Co-Investigator; Ivan Marazzi, Co-Investigator, Nevan Krogan , Co-Investigator. In this proposal, we hypothesize that multiple, discrete molecular pathways determine influenza disease severity, and that these pathways elicit biomarker signatures that can be identified through network-based modeling of system-level measurements. In Project 2, we propose to utilize leading edge OMICS approaches to identify ex vivo molecular signatures that correlate with clinical disease outcomes. The elucidation and characterization of factors that govern outcome-related biomarker signatures offer the potential for the development of novel antiviral therapies. In Aim 1, we will use a systems biology approach to elucidate network signatures associated with clinical influenza severity. Here, we will profile changes to the host transcriptome, proteome and metabolome, in response to infection using viruses of different pathogenicity, as well as additional host perturbations linked to clinical outcome. Ex vivo molecular signatures correlated with disease severity will be integrated and modeled with in vivo and clinical data generated in Project 1. In Aim 2, we propose to use genetic tools to identify nodes within outcome-related molecular signatures that are critical regulators of host response pathways and viral replication (`driver genes'). Both Aims 1 and 2 will rely on a paradigm of reiterative experimentation and modeling to link ex vivo signatures to clinical phenotypes, and identify the host proteins and pathways that govern them. In Aim 3, those genes found to regulate pathways and signatures associated with disease outcome (driver genes) will be further characterized. We propose to employ CRISPR-based analysis of transcriptional, epigenetic, proteomic, and metabolic profiles to provide insight into the role of these factors in regulating responses linked to disease outcomes (CRISPR-OMICs). Additional molecular, cellular, biochemical and in vivo studies will be conducted to further characterize those nodes that determine disease outcomes as potential therapeutic targets."
"9613496","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensory information, such as a visual scene, is broken down (encoded) in the early visual pathway into features which increase in complexity before being tied together (decoded) in higher brain areas. The thalamocortical projection of the visual pathway is involved in encoding, such that neurons in the thalamic population transform the visual input very differently than neurons one synapse away in the input layers of visual cortex. We do not understand the underlying circuits that contribute to this transformation of visual input at the thalamocortical synapse. One complication is that cortical cells which receive direct thalamic input also receive input from other nearby cortical cells, so it is difficult to understand the role of the thalamic input. The goal of this proposal is to tease apart the thalamocortical circuit by simultaneous observation and manipulation of the pre and post-synaptic population, in the thalamus and cortex respectively. We propose two novel techniques to study single thalamocortical synapses and to isolate the contribution of the thalamic projection to response properties of cortical cells. In Aim 1, we will use simultaneous extracellular recordings of many LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus) cells with intracellular recording of a cortical cell to study synaptic connections. This will allow us to directly study the LGN population that converges onto a cortical cell. In Aim 2 we take advantage of this prep by adding dynamic clamp, which we use to create monosynaptic connections in vivo. Dynamic clamp is a method similar to current clamp, which allows the 'injection' of fixed conductances into a cell. We will generate the conductance that will be injected to the cortical cell by by triggering synaptic conductance injections based on the spike time of a population of LGN cells. We can select this population and manipulate their spiking output in desired ways. We will also ensure that the cortical cell only receives visual input from the conductance injections. This allows us to study the response properties of the cortical cell as a function of the properties of the input thalamic population. Collectively, these studies will define several important but unknown properties of thalamocortical synapses and will test several existing hypotheses regarding visual encoding, leading to improved understanding of visual processing."
"9465733","Project Summary This project will validate two high throughput human blood-based DNA damage assays and develop them into commercial kits. The assays monitor types of damage associated with important human diseases. Whereas the PIG-A assay reports on gene mutation, the micronucleated reticulocyte (MN-RET) assay is responsive to chromosomal breaks and/or losses. The biomarkers are applicable to both humans and laboratory animals and will fulfill two important needs: extension of findings in laboratory animal models to direct studies in humans, and performance of well-controlled mechanistic laboratory studies to understand observations first made in humans. The assays utilize immunomagnetic separation prior to flow cytometry to dramatically enrich the relevant cell populations and thereby enhance assay precision and sensitivity. By providing simple-to-use kits with thoroughly documented reproducibility and inter-laboratory transferability, and validating the biomarkers for specific uses, researchers will have available tools with unprecedented efficiencies for comprehensively studying those factors that contribute to inter-individual differences in human DNA damage. Applications include the study of drug treatments, host and/or life-style factors that contribute to inter-individual differences in DNA damage and repair, exaggerated sensitivities to anti- neoplastic therapies, and population-based epidemiology studies of environmental exposures, including occupational exposures. The project benefits from a strong multidisciplinary team of internationally recognized scientists with a proven track record of successfully converting research advances into reliable commercial assay kits."
"9308255","The Neural and Behavioral Toxicity Assessment (NBTA) Core will provide information concerning the cellular and neurobehavioral consequences of toxicant exposures being studied in our Superfund Center. Neurotoxicant actions will be evaluated by cell-based screening using neuronotypic PC12 cells, neural stem cells, and neuronal-glial co-cultures, to screen for developmental neurotoxicity across the entire spectrum of neurodevelopmental events, from cell replication to differentiation into specific neural and neurotransmitter phenotypes. This will provide comparative dose-effect relationships for related chemicals in each study,  beneficial or harmful consequences of remediation strategies, and information on potential additive or synergistic toxic effects. The neurobehavioral screen will provide detailed assessment of cognitive and emotional functions affected by developmental toxicant exposures in test batteries that we have designed for the diverse models studied within the Center. The neurobehavioral batteries are tailored to the rodent and fish model systems used in the Center. These complementary models will be used to help the projects determine how the toxicant-induced molecular events, neurochemical disruption and neurocircuit miswiring cause persistent functional behavioral impairment. Specifically, for each project, the NBTA Core will include delineation of neurotransmitter systems and neuronal projections involved in the functional defects, as well as potential amelioration of toxicant-induced impairment as a result of different remediation strategies. The NBTA Core interacts with every project within the Center and provides a translation from the basic mechanistic studies of the individual projects to the potential impact on functional outcomes involving nervous system dysfunction. By providing a standardized approach to toxicity assessment, this core ensures that each of the projects and models shares common approaches to mechanism and outcome."
"9452748","Project Summary  The purpose of this five-year proposal is to provide a personalized interdisciplinary training program which will facilitate the applicant's successful transition into an independent career in academic cardiovascular disease (CVD) research. The knowledge and skills imparted by this project will be vital for the applicant to pursue his long-term research goal of identifying and characterizing novel genetic determinants of CVD, and ultimately translating these findings from bench to bedside. In this regard, the proposed application will meet key objectives of 1. Acquiring expertise in human genetics, biostatistics, genome-editing and in mouse models of atherosclerosis; 2. Enhancing the applicant's knowledge base, professional development and grant writing skills. Under the guidance of an Advisory Committee composed of internationally recognized experts in genomics, vascular biology, biostatistics and translational research, the applicant will receive the guidance and resources necessary to accomplish these goals and efficiently transition to independence.  Nearly 50% of one's lifetime risk of acquiring cardiovascular disease (CVD) is genetic in nature. A recent meta-analytical GWAS study conducted by members of the applicant's Advisory Committee identified a novel genetic variant within the intron of Leiomodin1 (LMOD1), a smooth muscle cell restricted gene which coincidentally was described by the applicant while a graduate student. Although, this new finding suggests that LMOD1 may be responsible for a portion of CVD risk, the mechanism by which this polymorphism leads to CVD remains to be identified. Thus, in this proposal the applicant will elucidate the role of this variant in CVD.  During the mentored (K99) phase of this proposal, the applicant will acquire new skills in advanced human genetics and biostatistics to unequivocally confirm that carriers of the risk allele have reduced LMOD1 expression in the diseased vessel. During the independent (R00) phase of this project, the applicant will build on strong preliminary data and employ advanced molecular biology techniques including luciferase reporter, gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to determine the molecular mechanism responsible for reduced LMOD1 expression in cells treated with PDGF-BB. Lastly, the applicant will determine how this reduced LMOD1 expression regulates atherogenesis in mouse models of human disease through the implementation of advanced surgical and genome editing techniques.  Taken together, this work will enhance the scientific community's understanding of the heritable component of CVD, and moreover provide a foundation of a lifelong career in CVD research for the applicant. The proposed work is relevant to the mission of the NIH as it will lead to the development of new therapies for patients suffering from pathological conditions such as heart attack and stroke."
"9510455","Lung disease caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection is a significant burden on global human health. Very young children and bone marrow transplant recipients are particularly vulnerable to developing severe lung disease. Current treatments are limited and costly. There are no licensed anti-virals or vaccines specific for RSV currently available to alleviate lung disease caused by RSV infection.  The preclinical development of therapeutics to treat RSV infections has been hampered by the lack of easily accessible small animal in vivo models that recapitulate the nature and magnitude of RSV infection and airway pathology of RSV infection of humans. This proposal explores genetically engineered hamsters as new models of RSV infection and disease for pre-clinical testing of RSV therapeutics. Preliminary studies suggest these new hamster models recapitulate the kinetics and airway pathology of RSV infection of human airways.  We have taken a rational approach in designing our hamster models. As RSV infection degrades STAT2 to enhance virus replication in human cells, but not rodent cells, we reasoned hamsters, normally only semi- permissive for RSV infection, may become more permissive to infection if deleted of STAT2. Our preliminary studies comparing RSV infection in wild-type versus hamsters deleted of STAT2 (STAT2-/-) confirmed this notion with more robust infection in the upper and lower airways of STAT 2-/- hamsters. These studies also revealed a more significant airway pathology in STAT2-/- hamsters infected by RSV, likely related to the increased infection and replication rates, and with striking similarities to the airway pathology seen in RSV-infected humans. We propose STAT2-/- hamsters provide an authentic small animal model for testing RSV therapeutics. Aim 1 focuses on quantitative assessment of RSV infection and subsequent airway pathology in STAT2-/- hamsters to provide a framework of outcome measures for future testing of new therapeutic approaches.  Bone marrow transplant recipients represent the other vulnerable patient population suffering prolonged and more severe RSV infections. The development of potent anti-virals and other approaches to alleviate airway disease are required as this population will likely benefit less from RSV vaccine approaches. By crossing STAT2- /- hamsters with hamsters deleted of RAG2 (RAG2-/-), an important modulator of lymphocyte differentiation, we next generate a hamster model deleted of STAT2 which is also deficient in T and B lymphocytes. Aim 2 focuses on testing whether STAT2 and RAG2 double knockout hamsters develop robust and prolonged RSV infections and more severe airway pathology, thus providing a model of RSV infection in bone marrow transplant recipients.  These studies aim to provide the RSV community with more authentic and easily accessible small animal models for pre-clinical testing of RSV therapeutics in two of the most vulnerable patient populations to RSV infection; otherwise healthy children and bone marrow transplant recipients."
"9469026","Project Summary: Characterizing global regulatory networks in human embryonic stem cells Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) provide a model for early preimplantation development and have the potential to be harnessed for applications in regenerative medicine. However, a comprehensive, integrated view of the regulatory network underlying hESC identity is fundamentally lacking. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate novel features of the global regulatory architecture in hESCs. In order to discover critical components of this network, a genome-wide shRNA screen was performed, identifying a number of previously unrecognized transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers essential to hESC biology, such as EP400, an epigenetic modifier that notably acts as a transcriptional activator in other cell types. Screen hits were characterized and narrowed to a final shortlist of 15 novel genes with a clear role in hESC maintenance. These factors will be sorted into functional categories and organized into wider, integrated clusters of co- regulation within the hESC network. The first aim will seek to characterize this newly defined set of novel, screen-identified factors alongside known, established hESC factors. Loss-of-function experiments will be used to sort each gene into functional categories defined by knockdown effects on pluripotency, self-renewal, or viability. Further characterization of gene function in hESCs will be conducted using functional assays and analysis of molecular markers. The second aim will employ global deep-sequencing-based approaches to identify relationships between critical hESC factors and reconstruct co-regulatory modules important to the maintenance of hESCs. Transcription factors will be clustered by their impact on global expression profile upon knockdown, with patterns of expression changes shared by co-regulators. Binding site analysis will allow for specific mapping of the regulatory circuitry that establishes and maintains the hESC transcriptional landscape. Finally, the same profiling methods will be used to integrate EP400 and its associated histone variant H2A.Z into this network to determine whether the structure of this epigenetic pathway aligns with downstream transcriptional modules as hypothesized, or displays its own unique, independent organization. The proposed studies will thus provide a systems view of the mechanisms by which transcriptional and epigenetic regulators converge to drive the unique programs of pluripotency and self-renewal in the early human embryo. A better understanding of the complex, network-based regulation governing hESC behavior will help address the need for more accessible models of human development and guide the advancement of regenerative therapies such as somatic cell reprogramming."
"9439526","TITLE: Dysregulated Adenosine Methylation of mRNA as a Novel Mechanism of Heart Failure PROJECT SUMMARY: One of most exciting advancements in the RNA field is the recent discovery that post-transcriptional modifications of mRNAs (epitranscriptome) are vital to several cellular processes including mRNA stability, nuclear export, cellular compartmentalization, splicing, translation and their degradation. However, function of the epitranscriptome remains unexplored in mature post-mitotic tissues such as the mammalian heart especially under the pathophysiological remodeling. Discrepancies in expression levels of mRNAs and proteins in the hearts of heart failure patients implicate a major role for the cardiac epitranscriptome in protein expression. Therefore, addressing this lack of mechanistic insight and understanding the pathomechanisms of yet unexplored epitranscriptomic regulations underlying cardiac remodeling are of major clinical interest. In a first-of-its kind approach, we studied the cardiac epitranscriptome and focused our investigation on N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent and functionally relevant chemical modification in mRNA. We discovered that m6A- containing mRNA is significantly increased during ischemic cardiac remodeling, associated with the loss of an m6A demethylase, fat and obesity-associated protein (FTO). We discovered FTO as a critical regulator of m6A methylation in the heart during cardiac remodeling. Post-ischemic loss of FTO is associated with a cascade of biological alterations including increase in m6A methylation, altered mRNA, miRNA and protein expression and diminished myocardial function. Therefore, we hypothesize that ischemic loss of m6A eraser, FTO, increases m6A mRNA methylation resulting in a diminished cardiac function; therefore, FTO gene transfer may rescue cardiac function in the ischemic hearts (Fig1). Our goal is to unravel the complex nature of FTO-modulated m6A-epitrancriptome, which plays a critical role in cardiac homeostasis and cardiac function under ischemia. We propose?for the first time? cardiac epitranscriptome as a highly sensitive, tunable regulatory layer in the pathomechanism of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The aims are: AIM 1: Characterize the dynamics of m6A methylation in mRNA and m6A-signature in post-ischemic mammalian hearts. AIM 2: Determine the role of m6A eraser, FTO in cardiomyocyte and cardiac function. AIM 3: Investigate the mechanisms of m6A function in cardiac mRNA fate and protein expression at the molecular and cellular level. Our finding on the dynamic nature of the cardiac epitranscriptome will open up a new paradigm that will lead to deeper understanding of cardiac remodeling on one hand and innovative therapeutic interventions on the other."
"9404471","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling is the coordinated process by which an action potential triggers cell contraction. It is initiated in specialized regions (called dyads) where the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR) comes into close apposition to the sarcolemma of cardiac myocytes. Previous work has led to the formulation of a model in which the fidelity and strength of EC coupling is critically dependent on the formation of stable dyads where membrane Ca2+ channels activate ryanodine receptors. However, contrary to this view, new evidence obtained by our team shows that the network and junctional SR are highly dynamic. The goal of my project is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SR motility in ventricular myocytes and discover how these mechanics alter EC coupling in these cells. To do this, we developed a novel strategy to monitor jSR motility in living, acutely dissociated adult ventricular myocytes using viral constructs that allow us to visualize movements of parts of the myocyte that have never been seen in live myocytes before. Our preliminary data are consistent with a model in which the reproducibility of EC coupling results from the activation of a temporally averaged number of SR Ca2+ release units forming and dissolving SR-sarcolemmal junctions. This model represents a departure from long-standing models of Ca2+ signaling in which the T-tubule sarcolemma-SR junction is thought to be static. We will investigate the mechanisms controlling as well as the biogenesis of SR mobility as well as its implications under physiological and pathological conditions. We will test the hypothesis that the SR of adult ventricular myocytes is a dynamic structure capable of forming and dissolving dyads. Furthermore, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the jSR contribute to aberrant Ca2+ signaling seen in myocardial infarction.   By elucidating the role of the SR in normal physiology, we will likely uncover a new potential mechanism by which the cell regulates Ca2+ signaling. Studying how the mechanisms controlling SR motility are dysregulated will aid in the understanding of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and other diseases with SR and T-tubule remodeling such as muscular dystrophy. Our expectation is that by providing a mechanism to SR biogenesis and dynamicity, we can discover ways to manipulate the SR to improve disease outcomes."
"9608819","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A gradual decline in renal function occurs in healthy aging individuals. Aging may exacerbate Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). About more than half of the CKD cases and majority of the end stage renal disease (ESRD) occur in the older population. These findings highlight the importance of kidney aging and its potential contribution to AKI, CKD and ESRD in the elderly. Since the population older than 65 years in the United States is expected to double during the next 20 years, focus on potential early intervention strategies for age-associated renal injury and disease becomes critical. We will test the hypothesis that the age-related decreases in nuclear hormone receptor FXR and G protein coupled membrane receptor TGR5 expression play an important role in age-related kidney disease by impairing mitochondrial function, which results in a) increased generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased generation of mitochondrial antioxidants, causing increased oxidative stress and inflammation, and b) decreased mitochondrial fatty acid ß-oxidation, causing increased renal lipid accumulation. We propose that FXR and/or TGR5 agonists or overexpression will prevent or markedly reduce age-related decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increase in albuminuria, podocyte loss, and accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins (fibrosis) by improving mitochondrial function, which results in a) decreased generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased generation of mitochondrial antioxidants, causing decreased oxidative stress and inflammation, and b) increased mitochondrial fatty acid ß-oxidation, causing decreased renal lipid accumulation. In SPECIFIC AIM 1, we will determine the role of FXR and TGR5 in progression of age-related renal disease. We will also perform mechanistic studies to determine how alterations in kidney bile acid composition regulate podocyte function. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, we will perform mechanistic studies to determine if FXR and TGR5 protect against age-related renal disease by Sirtuin 3 dependent mechanisms. Impact and Innovation: 1) The hitherto unrecognized roles of: i) nuclear receptor FXR, ii) G protein coupled receptor TGR5 and iii) the potential of dual FXR/TGR5 agonists as therapeutic agents for treating age- associated renal disease and complications. 2) The novel and distinct role of FXR and TGR5 agonists in regulation of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid metabolism, as they relate to age- associated renal conditions. 3) TGR5/FXR signaling mimics that of caloric restriction (CR), potentially leading to new intervention strategies for age-related kidney injury and complications. 4) Mechanistic studies to determine the roles of the bile acids and mitochondrial Sirtuin 3 in modulation of age-related renal disease."
"9469798","Project Summary  The human gut microbiota is a complex assemblage of species that contributes to host health through diverse mechanisms, including nutrient production and increased resistance to pathogen colonization. The composition of the gut community has been linked to numerous human diseases, but much remains to be learned about the factors that govern microbiota composition and stability. A relatively unexplored component of microbiota composition is the role of competitive interactions between bacteria, such as the antagonistic interactions mediated by type VI secretion systems (T6SSs). These protein complexes are found in Gram- negative bacteria and are used by many species, including human gut symbionts, to inject toxins into bacterial competitors. By preventing vulnerable strains from establishing in proximity to T6SSs-possessing aggressors, T6SSs may have a substantial effect on the composition and organization of bacterial communities, as well as the outcomes of opportunistic infections. However, it is challenging to examine these potential functions of the T6SS in vivo, as common animal models, like humans, have highly complex and variable gut communities. These traits pose an obstacle to identifying specific interactions that significantly affect the microbiota or host. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is an experimentally tractable model organism with a simple and highly conserved gut microbiota comprised of only nine species. Bee gut microbes Snodgrassella alvi and Gilliamella apicola encode T6SSs and are the dominant Gram-negative taxa in the bee small intestine, where they form spatially structured communities. Experimental manipulation of this community provides an opportunity to understand the effect of T6SSs on community structure and composition of gut communities. Additionally, a Serratia marcescens strain isolated from sick bees has proven to be lethal to bees upon oral inoculation. This strain encodes a T6SS similar to the aggressively antibacterial T6SS of Se. marcescens Db10. This isolate will be used to determine the role of T6SSs in mediating interactions between an opportunistic pathogen and the commensal gut community. To elucidate the role of T6SSs in the commensal gut community and during infection, the competitive capabilities of T6SS-deficient Sn. alvi and Se. marcescens mutants will be compared to wild type strains. The toxin proteins secreted through the Sn. alvi T6SSs will be identified through proteomic methods to expand our understanding of T6SS function and toxin diversification. Micrographic methods will be used to examine in vivo physical interactions between bacteria and disturbance of community structure. Finally, to better understand the interaction between the gut community and an invading pathogen, two high- throughput genomics screening methods will be used to identify Se. marcescens genes that are differentially expressed or important for the fitness in the presence of the microbiota. This work will expand our understanding of the effect of T6SS-mediated intercellular competition on a commensal gut microbiota and, ultimately, on host health."
"9449173","Project Summary/Abstract Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the transfer of lipids, including cholesteryl esters (CEs), triglycerides (TGs) and phospholipids (PLs) between high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low- density lipoproteins (LDL), and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). An elevated level of LDL- cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or a low level of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) in human plasma are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and familial hyperlipidemia disease. Since increased CETP can reduce HDL-C concentration and since CETP deficiency is associated with elevated HDL-C levels, five CETP inhibitors, i.e. Torcetrapib, Anacetrapib, Dalcetrapib, Evacetrapib and Obicetrapib have been investigated in clinical trials for treating CVD. However, the fact that three inhibitors failed in large clinical trials reflects our knowledge is little concerning the molecular mechanisms of CETP- mediated lipid transfer among lipoproteins. In the last funding period, we discovered the CETP penetrated to HDL and LDL/VLDL, forming a tunnel for CE transfer between lipoproteins. In this period, we propose to test highlighted residues that play key roles in CE transfer. It can be difficult to investigate CETP mechanisms using structural methods as interaction with CETP can alter the size, shape, and composition of lipoproteins, especially HDL. Thus, we propose i) to study the mutated CETP in CE transfer by all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and our validated optimized negative-staining electron microscopy (OpNS-EM) protocol. In OpNS, the flash-fixation of lipoprotein particles preserves a near native-state conformation for direct visualization of individual molecular or macromolecular particles. ii) In the last period, we identified a CETP interface that binds to lipoprotein and patented antibodies as CETP inhibitors for treatment of CVD. In this period, we propose to validate the antibodies? function in regulating plasma lipid levels in a rabbit dyslipidemia model. iii) To further understanding the CETP function in plasma phospholipid transfer, we propose to study the PLTP interaction with lipoprotein as PLTP has a similar sequence to CETP but a stronger function in phospholipid transfer among lipoproteins."
"9448420","Neurological (Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases) and neuropsychiatric disorders (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Tourette syndrome) associated with frontal-basal ganglia dysfunction are accompanied by deficits in stopping or suppressing actions. Action inhibition deficits can have devastating effects and have been linked to clinical motor symptoms (e.g., falling, freezing, dyskinetic movements), poor functional skills (e.g., driving), and behavioral disorders (e.g., poor impulse control). Unfortunately, there are few options for treatment deficits in inhibitory control. One potential way to modulate inhibitory control processes is direct stimulation of relevant neural circuitries. Specifically, it is possible to stimulate a key node in the brain's inhibitory control circuitry, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and directly modulate inhibitory control capabilities, including improving them. The STN is linked to two distinct forms of inhibitory control: (1) a stopping control mechanism that rapidly inhibits an initiated or ongoing action (2) a conflict control mechanism that selectively suppresses strong initial motor impulses that conflict and interfere with goal-directed actions. Our recent work and preliminary data lead to the hypothesis that these control mechanisms can be directly modulated and improved by stimulating the STN in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, our preliminary findings are strongly suggestive that modulating these distinct forms of inhibitory control requires stimulating in different STN subterritories. Additionally, a proposed, but scarcely tested idea is that inhibitory control mechanisms involve a predominantly right hemisphere circuitry. These state of findings leads to our specific hypotheses that inhibitory control circuitries can be directly modulated and improved by stimulating in distinct subregions and hemispheres in the STN. We propose experiments to systematically test the precise relationship between STN neural circuitry and inhibitory action control mechanisms. We propose novel interrogations of STN substructures and neurophysiology to define links between inhibitory control mechanisms and STN subterritories and hemispheres. In Specific Aim 1, we use innovative electrode localization and stimulation methods (both post-operatively as well as in the operating room) to test the hypothesis that stimulating dorsal and ventral subregions in the left and right STN produce dissociable effects on stopping control and on conflict control mechanisms. In Specific Aim 2, we investigate the relationships between inhibitory control mechanisms and STN neurophysiology by recording single unit neural activity in bilateral STN during intraoperative placement of DBS electrodes in PD patients. While the cognitive neuroscience of inhibitory control deficits in PD will benefit directly from this work, the project is designed with broader applications in mind as the neurosurgical community explores how DBS in the STN and other basal ganglia structures can improve inhibitory control deficits in individuals with Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, and other neuropsychiatric disorders associated with basal ganglia circuitry dysfunction."
"9590179","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For unknown reasons, the incidence of allergies and asthma continues to increase in the US. It is increasingly clear that asthma is a heterogeneous disease with differing endotypes which suggest discrete pathophysiology. In humans, asthma exists in allergic and non-allergic forms. It is an unmet need in the field to better understand ho different mechanisms contribute to asthma endotypes. Genome wide array analysis has identified many asthma relevant genes. However, due to poor correlation between steady state mRNA levels and protein, transcriptomic approaches may overlook critical genes. Posttranscriptional gene regulation by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important control mechanisms for proinflammatory genes. RBPs, such as HuR (elav1) which bind to AU-rich elements (AREs) play critical roles in coordinately regulating proinflammatory genes in asthma by stabilizing target gene mRNAs and increasing translatability. Methods used by our lab and others, called RNA immunoprecipitation applied to microarrays (RIP-Chip) have identified how RBPs are coordinately regulating inflammation. Posttranscriptional gene regulation plays an important role in CD4+ T differentiation, yet these processes are poorly understood. Our long term goal is to understand posttranscriptional gene regulation in airway inflammation. The objective of this application, which is our next step in pursuit of that goal, is to understand how HuR is regulating key molecules, such as Th2/Th17 cytokines and IL-2 during allergen challenge. The central esis is that the RBP, HuR, is permissive for development of CD4+ Th2 mediated allergic airway inflammation and required for normal IL-2 homeostatic expression. The rationale for this proposal is that our work has demonstrated that HuR controls both Th2 and Th17 differentiation. HuR KO mice do not develop airway inflammation due to suppression of Th2 cytokine production and do not have the ability to turn off IL-2 expression following T cell activation. Understanding posttranscriptional mechanisms of IL-2 and Th2/Th17 cytokine gene regulation will allow the field to modulate and affect outcomes of inflammatory responses in allergen driven asthma and also perhaps aid in better defining the heterogeneity amongst asthma endotypes. We plan to test the central esis and accomplish these objectives by the following four specific aims: 1) Does HuR ablation alter CD4+ Th subset differentiation?; 2) Determine whether HuR is required for allergic airway inflammation in vivo; 3) Mechanistic determinants of IL-2 and Th2 cytokine expression; 4) Determine whether human lymphocytes have dysregulated HuR expression. We believe our study is innovative, because such approaches will provide novel mechanistic insights into T cell posttranscriptional cytokine regulation. The proposed research is significant, because it will elucidate how airway responses connect at the molecular level with both adaptive and innate immunity to control lung inflammation."
"9405621","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In vitro studies have established that airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells exhibit phenotypic plasticity in response to inflammatory events mediated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing has emerged as an regulator of gene expression and studies of miRNA function in ASM hold promise for the development of novel miRNA-based tools for prognosis and therapy. The long-term goal of our studies is to identify the miRNA-mediated gene- silencing mechanisms determining ASM cell phenotype in asthma. Our laboratory was the first to characterize miRNA expression in ASM following a pro-inflammatory stimulus and identified miR-25 as a target of the inflammatory response that regulates plasticity of ASM cells. This proposal will test the hypothesis that expression of miR-25 attenuates allergic asthma pathogenesis by altering ASM phenotype. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether miR-25 expression in a mouse model of allergic inflammation attenuates hyperreactivity, remodeling and alters ASM contractile force using a unique transgenic mouse model of smooth muscle-targeted miR-25 expression. These mice will be used to assess the effects of miR-25 on AHR, remodeling and ASM contractility following acute and chronic models of ovalbumin-sensitization and challenge. In Specific Aim 2, we will study the effect of smooth muscle-targeted miR-25 expression on increased ASM mass in vivo following acute and chronic ovalbumin-sensitization and challenge by assessing proliferative markers and mitogenic signaling pathways to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this miR-25 function. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine whether miR-25 affects the phenotype of asthmatic ASM cells using gain and loss of miR-25 function studies, as well as effects on identified targets of miR-25 mediated gene-silencing. This unique experimental approach, coupled with correlations in human diseased cells, will provide mechanistic data describing miR-25 function in the lung and be an essential step towards developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting miRNA in asthma."
"9447960","Summary: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a deadly disease in urgent need of newer therapeutic modalities. PDAC tumors are very heterogeneous carrying alterations in many critical pathways and require a broad form of therapy that can activate multiple tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) simultaneously. We have shown that in PDAC over-expression of the nuclear exporter protein Exportin 1 (XPO1) leads to functional inactivation of TSPs (such as FOXO3a, p27, Par-4) through their mislocalization. We were the first to demonstrate that inhibition of XPO1 by CRISPR/Cas9 validated Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) selinexor and analogs can restore the anti-tumor function of multiple TSPs leading to PDAC cell death and tumor inhibition in orthotopic models. More significantly, our findings show that SINE synergize with gemcitabine (GEM) and nab-paclitaxel leading to enhanced PDAC growth inhibition, apoptosis, reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and spheroid disintegration of PDAC derived cancer stem cells (CSCs). The observed synergy was due in part to enhanced nuclear localization of TSPs and suppression of CSC and EMT markers. Pathway analysis showed enhancement in cell death signaling and suppression of CSC sustaining networks. Most importantly we observed activation of fibroblast specific cell death pathways highlighting an as of yet unexplored role of XPO1 in sustaining fibroblast growth that is recognized to support high desmoplastic reaction (DR) in PDAC. Our multi-model pre-clinical work has led to a Phase Ib/II clinical study involving GEM-nab-paclitaxel-selinexor for metastatic PDAC (NCT02178436). In this proposal we hypothesize that XPO1 inhibition will enforce the nuclear retention of TSPs, restore their anti- tumor function leading to enhancement of cytotoxic efficacy of GEM-nab-paclitaxel in PDAC. To validate our hypothesis, we propose to integrate high-throughput RNA-Seq and SILAC-MS methodologies in primary cellular and transgenic mice models and in a Phase Ib/II trial combining selinexor with Gem-nab-paclitaxel in PDAC patients. We anticipate that our holistic analyses will, for the first time, delineate the impact of XPO1 inhibition in re-programming of PDAC CSC and DR networks that leads to the enhancement in the efficacy of GEM-nab-paclitaxel in tumors. In Aim1 we will demonstrate in vitro synergy between GEM-nab-paclitaxel and selinexor in primary PDAC models using high-throughput methodologies. In Aim2 we will demonstrate the efficacy and synergy of GEM-nab-paclitaxel-selinexor in LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre mice model. These studies will identify sensitivity and/or resistance markers that will support our phase Ib/II trial in Aim3 in which we intend to determine the safety and efficacy of selinexor when combined with GEM-nab- paclitaxel in patients with metastatic PDAC. Biopsies from this trial will be used to validate locked pharmacodynamic markers of selinexor target engagement in patients. Clinical Impact: The successful completion our studies will bring forward a new therapy to improve the survival of patients with PDAC."
"9602570","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a vulnerable period for the onset of several psychiatric disorders where the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved, yet, our mechanistic understanding of this susceptibility remains incipient due to insufficient knowledge of the normative changes occurring during this developmental stage. Thus, the long-term goal of this proposal is to identify key cell- and circuit-level processes underlying the normal development of the PFC in order to understand the adolescent vulnerability to the onset of psychiatric disorders where the PFC is compromised. Studies from our previous funding period reveal that the PFC undergoes massive functional remodeling in both glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission during adolescence. Nonetheless, it is the local GABAergic system that appears to render the PFC labile during adolescence to the extent that any insult occurring during this developmental period will prevent the normal functional acquisition of inhibitory control in the PFC through a gain of local GABAergic function. Interestingly, our data indicate this GABAergic facilitation is contemporaneous with two other developmentally-regulated PFC events occurring during adolescence: 1) a functional strengthening of the ventral hippocampus-to-PFC pathway, and 2) increased glutamatergic activity onto a subset of PFC GABAergic interneurons, suggesting these events are interrelated. Thus, the objective of this application is to determine whether there is a causal relationship between specific excitatory afferents and the acquisition of PFC inhibitory control through their effect in specific GABAergic populations. The central hypothesis is that the functional maturation of GABAergic transmission in the PFC is dependent upon the activation of specific prefrontal interneurons by specific afferents that drive PFC activity during adolescence, such as those from the ventral hippocampus and basolateral amygdala. We will test this hypothesis through the pursuit of 3 Specific Aims. We will first determine the contribution of input-specific afferent drive (Aim 1) and the role of specific prefrontal interneurons (Aim 2) in enabling the gain of GABAergic function in the PFC during adolescence. Aim 3 will test if impaired GABAergic maturation in the PFC during adolescence can elicit enduring deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors as adults. All in all, the proposed research plan is innovative in our opinion because it will incorporate knowledge of the events occurring during adolescence to explain the acquisition of adult PFC faculties and development of PFC deficits, especially from the perspective of how prefrontal GABAergic maturation is regulated by afferent structures widely involved in normal and pathological neural responses. The proposed studies are significant because they will uncover key neurodevelopmental mechanisms that contribute to the acquisition of mature cognitive abilities in adults. Such knowledge is expected to have a positive impact in the development of age-specific interventions aimed at decreasing the incidence or ameliorating the symptoms of mental disorders within the adolescent/young adult population."
"9405870","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The greatest environmental risk factor for developing nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Both complexes of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and the rapamycin-resistant mTORC2, are stimulated in response to UVB. Cell survival in UVB-induced keratinocyte carcinogenesis has been shown in our previous studies to be mTORC2-depedent. The tumor suppressor FOXO3a, a member of the Forkhead box family of proteins, is an important transcription factor involved in regulating cell survival. FOXO3a activity is attenuated as a result of AKT activation, which is downstream of mTORC2. AKT can phosphorylate FOXO3a and this phosphorylation motif causes the chaperone protein 14-3-3 to dimerize and bind to FOXO3a. The bound complex is then sequestered into the cytoplasm, which reduces FOXO3a nuclear activity. UVB has been shown to activate AKT through the mTORC2 pathway; however, the role of FOXO3a in UVB-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes has yet to be studied. We hypothesize that UVB generates a unique anti-apoptotic response in keratinocytes as a result of post-translational modifications of FOXO3a that are dependent on mTORC2. To investigate the role of mTORC2 and FOXO3a in UVB-induced apoptosis, we will use both human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) as well as inducible Rictor-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iRictKO cells). Disruption of mTORC2-signaling will be accomplished using mTOR pathway inhibitors and shRNA targeting mSIN1 in HaCaT cells and treatment with 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT) in iRictKO cells. The Rictor and mSIN1 proteins are key structural components unique to mTORC2 and their removal dramatically lowers mTORC2 activity. FOXO3a protein expression will also be knocked down using shRNA. The work proposed in Aim 1 will examine the mechanisms behind mTORC2-dependent FOXO3a regulation by studying 14-3-3 dimerization, binding to FOXO3a, and localization of the 14-3-3/FOXO3a complex in response to a previously optimized apoptotic dose of UVB. Aim 2 will investigate UVB-induced FOXO3a-dependent apoptosis using Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, as well as measuring FOXO3a-specific binding and subsequent transcription of pro-apoptotic genes through Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Real-Time Quantitative PCR, respectively. Confirmation of our hypotheses will provide strong evidence that mTORC2 plays a critical role in regulating FOXO3a expression, localization and activity following UVB-irradiation, in addition to demonstrating that the UVB-induced apoptotic response in keratinocytes is largely dependent on signaling through mTORC2 and FOXO3a."

"9447671","ABSTRACT Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a life-threatening immune-mediated thrombotic disorder caused by antibodies to PF4/heparin complexes. The immune response is common and yet little is understood about its occurrence. In the last funding period, we made fundamental observations related to early events surrounding the host?s encounter with the PF4/heparin antigenic complex. Specifically, we showed: 1) preferential binding of PF4/heparin to circulating B-cells, compared with other leukocytes or platelets, 2) heparin-dependent binding of PF4/heparin to B-cells in patients receiving heparin, 3) complement fixation by PF4/heparin antigen, 4) complement-mediated PF4/heparin binding to circulating B-cells in patients receiving heparin, and 5) binding of complement-coated antigen to B-cells via complement receptor 2 (CR2/ CD21). In the following aims, we will test the hypothesis that complement activation by PF4/heparin complexes and deposition of antigen on B-cells via CD21 is essential for development of HIT autoantibodies. Specific Aim 1: Mechanism of complement activation by PF4/heparin complexes. In preliminary data, we show that mannose-binding lectin and ficolin-2 bind PF4/heparin complexes. Based on these findings, we will test the hypothesis that PF4/heparin complexes activate complement via the lectin pathway. We will define the structural basis of PF4/heparin-lectin interactions, study functional interactions of lectins with PF4/heparin complexes, and examine the role of complement inhibition in HIT. Specific Aim 2: Cellular consequences of CD21 engagement by PF4/heparin and complement. Binding of complement-coated antigen to CD21 augments humoral immunity by 103 to 104 fold. We hypothesize that binding of complement-coated multivalent PF4/heparin to the CD21 complex facilitates recruitment and signaling of antigen-specific B-cells. We will examine downstream signaling, activation and proliferation of cognate and non-cognate B-cells, perform in vivo studies in mice with a fixed B-cell receptor and characterize the contribution of CD21-expressing follicular dendritic cells to Ab formation. Specific Aim 3: Examine host predictors of PF4/heparin seroconversion. Complement-coated antigen can be detected on B-cells in some, but not all, patients receiving heparin therapy. Using a novel C3 capture immunoassay, we also show significant donor to donor variation in healthy donor plasma incubated with a fixed dose of PF4/heparin. Based on these observations, we will examine host susceptibility to anti- PF4/heparin seroconversions by characterizing the complement proteome and using antigen-positive B-cells as a marker for seroconversions in heparinized patients. By defining the cellular pathways that initiate formation of PF4/heparin Abs, we hope to uncover mechanisms relevant to the immunogenicity of other auto- or exogenous antigens."
"9465714","Summary Since its discovery in 1969, Lassa virus (LASV), a bi-segmented RNA virus from the family Arenaviridae, has been recognized as the cause of disease affecting a quarter million people per year, resulting in ~5,000 deaths annually in West Africa. Due to global travel, there have been numerous confirmed cases of LASV infection outside West Africa including the US. Its ability to spread as an aerosol and a case fatality rate of ~15% make LASV a major threat to human health and a BSL 4 pathogen. Unfortunately, no FDA-approved drugs or vaccines are available for treatment of LASV. The overall goal of this project is to address this medical need by identifying and validating small molecule inhibitors of LASV infection as prophylactics and/or therapeutics. The strategy of this project is to identify small molecule inhibitors that target the cellular entry of LASV. Being the first step in viral infection and occurring in the extracellular/endosomal environment, viral entry is a susceptible and accessible target for antiviral therapy. The approach is to leverage our experience with a homogeneous, biochemical, high-throughput screening (HTS) method, AlphaLISA, to identify small molecules that prevent interactions between the glycoprotein of LASV and its host receptor LAMP1. Previously, we developed and applied a biochemical HTS based on AlphaLISA technology to identify compounds that block the Ebola glycoprotein (GP) binding to its host receptor NPC1. Two distinct scaffolds were identified and one exhibited potency against infectious Ebola virus in a murine in vivo study. In Phase I, for Aim 1, an AlphaLISA HTS will be developed and optimized for the identification of small molecules that inhibit the interaction between LASV GP1 and its receptor LAMP1. In Aim 2, a biolayer interferometry (BLI) biochemical assay and cell-based secondary assays utilizing recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) carrying arenavirus glcyoproteins (GP) in place of VSV-GP will be built and optimized to confirm initial hits from the primary screen, to determine which interacting partner they bind, and to approximate the affinity of that interaction. In Aim 3, the HTS will be applied to diverse chemical libraries, and hits will be confirmed in the secondary assays. In Aim 4, hits will be validated in infectious Lassa virus assays and prioritized by drug-like structural features and in vitro ADME properties. Together, these assays will identify and validate compounds that suppress LASV infection by inhibiting viral entry and will provide valuable information for prioritizing those inhibitors. In Phase II, we will chemically optimize priority inhibitors for potency and selectivity and evaluate them in animal infection models."
"9466592","PROJECT SUMMARY Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of infant hospitalizations in the U.S., and the disease burden among the elderly is similar to non-pandemic influenza A. Traditional strategies have failed to generate an effective RSV vaccine, and in some instances vaccination resulted in enhanced disease, underscoring the complexity of the human immune response to RSV. Although a prophylactic antibody is available (palivizumab, a humanized mouse mAb marketed by MedImmune as Synagis?), its high cost and modest efficacy have restricted its use to high-risk infants. Moreover, due to this high cost, palivizumab is inaccessible to children in developing nations and is unavailable in 4 of the 5 most populous countries ? more than half the world's population does not have access to this type of treatment. The public health benefit and the worldwide accessibility would undoubtedly be improved by lowering the cost of RSV immunoprophylaxis. In this Phase 1 proposal, Dartmouth College (Hanover, NH), Adimab (Lebanon, NH), and Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc. (San Diego, CA), are teaming to develop a fully human mAb with the following properties: 1) > 50-fold neutralization potency versus palivizumab and at least 2-fold more potent in vitro and in vivo than Medimmune and Regeneron's current clinical candidates (MEDI8897/REGN2222); 2) binds a different epitope than palivizumab and neutralizes palivizumab-resistant strains; and 3) Increased serum half-life so injections can be administered once per RSV season rather than monthly as required for palivizumab. With a more potent mAb (i.e. lower dose) that can be dosed less frequently, the team's objective is to dramatically lower the price for RSV immunoprophylaxis. In addition, competition in the marketplace would also help to reduce costs since palivizumab currently has a monopoly on the RSV market. We propose the following Specific Aims to accomplish our objective: 1) Engineer and produce the best in vitro neutralizing mAbs with and without fucosylation of N-glycans; 2) Select lead candidates for advancement to in vivo testing using neutralization potency and manufacturability criteria; 3) Determine the in vivo potency of the neutralizing mAbs produced with or without fucosylation."
"9453264","Title: Interaction of human norovirus with B cells Summary Human noroviruses cause a devastating number of infections that are associated with significant economic losses globally. Thus, there is a critical need for developing effective prevention strategies, therapeutics, and diagnostics platforms for human norovirus infections. However, there is a fundamental gap in understanding the life cycle of human noroviruses at the cellular level due to the historical lack of a cell culture system. The long-term goal of the research program is to increase knowledge of human norovirus biology and to develop effective strategies for their control and prevention. The objective of this application is to develop a robust, easy-to-use, resource-efficient HuNoV culture system and gain critical insights into the fundamental characteristics of infection in B cells. The first description of human norovirus infection in cell culture demonstrated infection of one human norovirus genotype in BJAB human B cells. New data extended these findings to another prevalent genotype, and subcloning of the cell line resulted in clones differentially susceptible to both virus strains. The latter suggested the presence of host factors that promote or inhibit infection. Exciting new data further indicated that the same human noroviruses belonging to two genotypes infected primary human blood-derived B cells in a novel B cell culture system. Addition of the nucleoside analogue 2?-C-methylcytidine blocked infection, confirming viral replication. Infection levels varied by donor and depended on the subtypes of B cells present in the culture. These data led to the central hypothesis that human noroviruses infect specific human B cell subsets and that a host factor(s) restricts virus infection in other subsets. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Define parameters of human norovirus infection in primary human B cells; and 2) Determine whether a restriction factor limits human norovirus infection in B cell subsets. The approach is innovative as human norovirus infection will be investigated in two unique human B cell culture models (i.e., BJAB subclones, primary B cells) using a combination of established and newly developed virologic and immunologic tools. The impact of the research is high since it will significantly increase basic knowledge of human norovirus-host interaction and may identify novel targets for the developments for antiviral drugs and immunotherapies. The proposed research is further significant because it is expected to lead to the generation of a human norovirus-susceptible cell line(s) that is easy to use by the entire norovirus research community to address a wide spectrum of basic science and translational research questions. Thus, these studies have the potential to fast-track development of effective vaccines, antivirals and treatment options for human norovirus infections that will ultimately reduce morbidity, mortality and the economic burden associated with human norovirus infections."
"9606260","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mentored Phase: A long-term goal of the mentor, Dr. David Pollock, is to elucidate the role of ET-1 in salt sensitive hypertension. Recently, it was demonstrated that the interstitium of the skin is an important 4 reservoir for Na+, and defects in this storage capacity occurs in salt sensitive hypertension. While mechanisms are not fully understood, preliminary data suggest that vascular endothelial cell derived ET-1 plays a role in skin Na+ storage and clearance during a high salt intake. Therefore, the central hypothesis of the mentored phase is that increases in extrarenal vascular ET-1 influences blood pressure by increasing skin Na+ storage and clearance in response to high salt intake. To test this hypothesis, a vascular endothelial cell   specific ET-1 knockout mouse (VEET KO) will be utilized. The first specific aim will determine if vascular ET-1 mediates pathways that regulate Na+ storage and clearance in response to a high salt intake. These include skin interstitial Na+ concentration, macrophages and lymphocytes, tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein, vascular endothelial growth factor c, and lymph vessel hyperplasia. It is expected that increasing salt intake will lead to increases in each of these factors, and this will be abolished n VEET KO mice. Previous studies indicate that loss of any of these regulatory pathways results in salt sensitive hypertension, however VEET KO mice are hypotensive. It is believed that this is due to lack of ET-1 in renal vasculature, which would increase renal function will isolate the role of extrarenal vascular ET-1 in blood pressure regulation. Question 3 will address this question through the transplant of kidneys from control mice with intact vascular ET-1 into VEET KO mice, a manipulation that is expected to cause salt sensitive hypertension. Independent Phase: Several lines of evidence suggest that increased ET-1 mediates cardiovascular disease associated with obesity; however, preliminary data and previous studies on cultured adipocytes suggest that reduced ETA and/or increased ETB receptor activation on adipocytes produce a favorable environment that leads to obesity. Accordingly, the overall hypothesis of the independent phase is that an imbalance between ETA/ETB receptor signaling in adipocytes creates a favorable environment that leads to obesity. The second specific aim will determine if reductions in ETA and/or increases in ETB receptor expression and function in adipocytes can lead to obesity. This will be tested through in vitro experiments on cultured adipocytes as well as knocking out ETA receptors specifically in adipose tissue of mice. Specific aim 2 will also determine if reduced ETA and/or increases in ETB receptor expression and function occurs in obesity. This will be tested by determining if ET-1 receptor expression, binding, and signaling is altered in adipose tissue of lean and obese human subjects. The third specific aim will determine if metabolic and dietary factors, such as leptin and western diet, cause an imbalance of ET-1 signaling in adipose tissue. ET-1 production, as well as ET-1 receptor expression and binding will be determined in adipose tissue of ob/ob and db/db mice and animals chronically fed a high fat diet. The goals of the proposed studies will undoubtedly shed light on mechanistic pathways by which ET-1 influences blood pressure and obesity, two prevalent risk factors for cardiovascular disease."
"9456316","Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and ?C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets."
"9308251","This project explores the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on development in an ecological context. The project will include studies of a population of killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) inhabiting a highly PAH-polluted estuary in Virginia, the Elizabeth River (ER), that includes a Superfund site. This population is highly resistant to the developmental impacts of PAHs occurring at this site and to laboratory exposures to specific PAHs, relative to killifish from uncontaminated sites. Thus the Elizabeth  River phenotype provides an opportunity for studying evolutionary impacts of pollution, including mechanisms of adaptation and consequences of adaptation. And importantly, understanding mechanisms of adaptation will provide insight into mechanisms of developmental toxicity of PAHs, now becoming recognized as a critical target of this increasingly prevalent class of Superfund chemicals for both wildlife and human health. Other studies with killifish from a reference site and with zebrafish will explore specific  mechanisms of PAH developmental toxicity, including effects on mitochondrial function and mtDNA damage, and the consequences of low level PAH exposures in embryos for later life stages. Consequences will include explorations of tissue architecture, effects of later life exposures to other Center chemicals, and in collaboration with other Center projects and cores, neurobehavioral effects will be emphasized. The specific aims of the project are: 1. To determine the mechanisms underlying resistance to PAH-mediated embryotoxicity in the Elizabeth River population of killifish. 2. To determine positive or negative  consequences of this resistant phenotype. 3. To determine the effects of PAHs and other chemicals of interest to the Center on mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial function during embryonic development. 4. To determine the later life consequences of low level PAH exposures to embryos. These aims will be accomplished through a highly collaborative effort among a molecular toxicologist (Dr. Joel Meyer), a fish pathologist and ecotoxicologist (Dr. David Hinton) and an aquatic biochemical toxicologist (Dr. Richard Di Giulio)."
"9465817","Project Summary A research plan is proposed to engineer goats that produce fully human immunoglobulin. These animals will be evaluated as a candidate platform system for production of both targeted therapeutic immunoglobulin as well as reagent antibodies for standards and controls of serological assays of human clinical samples. Previous studies have demonstrated that ungulates such as cattle can produce large amounts of human immunoglobulins and show extremely high titers and neutralizing antibody activities against various antigens, including infectious diseases, toxins and other targets following multiple immunizations. In this study, SAB Capra LLC (SAB) and Utah State University intend to expand and optimize this technology by producing transchromosomic (Tc) goats containing a human artificial chromosome vector (HAC) which contains the entire germline repertoire of the human antibody genes. In addition, the participants will produce goat fibroblast cell lines where the endogenous goat antibody genes will be silenced using current gene editing technologies. There are three specific aims in this project: (1) develop the first human immunoglobulin producing Tc goats by transferring the HAC containing the germ line human antibody heavy and light chain genes to KO fetal fibroblast cell lines; (2) evaluate and characterize human immunoglobulin produced in the Tc goats from Aim 1 and determine the stability and antibody production of the Tc goats and compare the immunoglobulin response to Tc cattle as well as humans; (3) produce high titer targeted immunoglobulin to pandemic flu strains (H7N9 and/or H5N1) for target specific evaluation. Data generated from this study will enable further work to be conducted to determine the usefulness of small ungulates producing human antibodies used as production animals to produce targeted human immunoglobulin therapeutic candidates and diagnostic standards and controls to emerging diseases. If this project is completed successfully, it will also have a broad implication that SAB?s platform technology can be used in both a large (cattle) and small (goat) ungulate species providing greater flexibility in producing product candidates. The addition of a small ungulate species will reduce costs associated with generating antibodies for small volume products as well as targeted human immunoglobulins used as diagnostic standards and controls for testing human clinical samples."
"9259562","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Genomic information is a new form of data that has the potential to more accurately tailor treatments to the individual and improve health outcomes. However, most physicians do not have the necessary training and experience to incorporate this type of data into their practice without assistance. Pharmacogenomic (PGx) clinical decision support (CDS) systems are a new generation of CDS that have the potential to close this gap by incorporating genetic information into electronic health record (EHR) workflows for the first time. As participants in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Northwestern University (NU) has implemented first-generation PGx CDS in the clinical setting. However, outstanding design and implementation questions must be answered before PGx CDS tools can be more broadly disseminated. We do not fully understand how clinicians react to PGx CDS alerts, how they incorporate alert advice into decision- making, or how to best design the tools to ensure compliance and improve care. Preliminary research has shown low physician compliance, indicating that current tools are inadequate. We hypothesize that the application of implementation science (IS) methods to the development of PGx CDS will improve physician adoption and compliance rates. We will utilize a variety of user-centered and socio- technical design methods to address PGx CDS design questions. First, we will conduct an analysis of NU EHR alert log data and clinician interviews to understand how existing first-generation PGx CDS systems are used and perceived. Second, we will conduct targeted interviews and focus groups to more fully understand physician workflows and genomic data needs, from which we will propose modifications to the PGx CDS tools currently in use. Finally, we will follow up with a systematic evaluation of these proposed modifications through prototyping and structured usability testing. This work will result in a set of refined PGx CDS alerts for physicians to apply to patient care, and will also serve as a model for future PGx CDS alert development. The applicant, Tim Herr, is a PhD Candidate in the Health Sciences Integrated PhD Program at the NU Feinberg School of Medicine. His research, beginning at the Master's level, has focused on the development and implementation of PGx CDS. This F31 award would allow Mr. Herr the opportunity to supplement his extensive technical abilities with the additional skills necessary for a career as an independent research scientist. This award would allow him to make additional scientific contributions to the development of PGx CDS while building new expertise in fundamental IS research skills, such as interview techniques and usability testing, and also complete additional training in human-computer interaction."
"9619103","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified statistically significant associations of common genetic variants with a variety of complex diseases and risk factors, these common variants typically explain only 5-10% of the genetic contribution to the phenotypic variance. The residual genetic variance, the missing heritability, may have several sources and is in part attributed to rare variants. As a means of performing association studies in large populations, a panel of variants derived from the exome sequencing of over 12,000 subjects has been used to create an Illumina Infinium genotyping array, the ExomeChip, which features non-synonymous, non-sense, and splice-site coding-region rare or infrequent variants. The analytic challenges and the sample size requirements for the high-quality analysis of these rare coding-region variants will require novel organizational structures and collaborations. In the GWAS era, one of the most successful and productive collaborations has been the CHARGE Consortium, which facilitated prospectively planned GWAS meta-analyses of multiple phenotypes among large cohort studies. The original five CHARGE cohorts and four collaborating cohorts have jointly-called ExomeChip genotype data on more than 50,000 participants. While the cohorts have been able to reallocate funding (with Institute approval) to generate the rare variant data, there are no additional funds available in existing sources to address analytic issues, to coordinate efforts, or to implement the analysis of the ExomeChip data. The CHARGE collaboration, which takes advantage of the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in these cohort studies, represents a unique resource for genetic studies. The phenotype-specific Working Groups take the lead in choosing and harmonizing phenotypes. The CHARGE Analysis Committee members not only provide recommendations for analytic methods, but they also solve analytic problems, conduct cohort-specific analysis, and implement consortium- wide prospectively planned meta-analyses. In the GWAS era, these methods and this organizational structure enabled the CHARGE investigators to accelerate the discovery of genetic association for common variants. Using the available ExomeChip coding-region genotype data from 9 well-phenotyped cohorts, the primary aim is to discover novel candidate genes and putative functional variants for high-priority heart, lung and blood phenotypes in multi-ethnic cohorts. The main activities include the selection of high-priority phenotypes, the appraisal and dissemination of analytic methods, the conduct of rare-variant analyses within each cohort, the meta-analysis of cohort-specific findings, both within and between ethnic groups, analysis of family data, pathway analyses, efforts to identify analytic problems, publication of findings, and the public release of source code and methods appraisals. We expect to complete at least 3-4 major analyses each year. The findings will be used to better understand biological pathways that may identify therapeutic targets."

We began when the first eukaryotic genome was completed (budding yeast) and developed an array of technologies to decipher protein function from genome sequence. In this application, we make the natural progression towards understanding how protein variation affects protein levels, modification, function and structure. We propose to develop technologies in four areas: 1) To identify different protein variants or isoforms. 2) To quantify proteins by mass spectrometry with a focus on determining absolute levels of a protein. 3) To study how protein variation affects protein function. 4) To determine the structures of protein complexes not amenable to high-resolution methods such as x-ray crystallography and NMR."
"9416828","The overall goal of this proposal is to study the role of methyl-lysine signaling by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) transcription factor in the epigenetic control of gene transcription during memory formation. Specifically, it will investigate whether the NF-kB p65 subunit acts as an initiator of epigenetic mechanisms through its recruitment of the histone methyltransferase G9a-like protein (GLP), mediator of the histone 3 lysine 9 di-methyl mark (H3K9me2). The first specific aim will test the hypothesis that the lysine methyltransferase SETD6 regulates monomethylation of p65 at lysine 310 (p65K310me1) and H3K9me2 changes in the hippocampus during memory consolidation, and will characterize these changes. The second specific aim will test whether p65K310me1 promotes recruitment of GLP, thereby mediating H3K9me2 changes in the hippocampus during memory consolidation. The rationale for these investigations stems from recent studies in which SETD6 was shown to mediate p65K310me1, thereby promoting recruitment of GLP and subsequent H3K9me2. However, this mechanism has only been demonstrated in vitro, in the context of immune cells. Whether this occurs in the brain in response to learning, or is critical for memory consolidation is currently unknown. Similarly, whether p65 methylation mediates an epigenetic program of transcriptional control with behavioral consequences has not yet been investigated. Preliminary data from our lab suggests that p65K310me1 increases during memory consolidation. Furthermore, we have shown that p65 interacts with SETD6 in the rat hippocampus and that knockdown of SETD6 in the dorsal hippocampus results in impaired fear memory consolidation. Building on these findings, we will use Western blot analysis, chromatin and co- immunoprecipitation to measure p65K310me1, p65-GLP interaction, and H3K9me2 changes following knockdown and overexpression of SETD6 in vivo. Next, we will mimic p65K310me1 using plasmids to induce expression of constitutively-methylated p65K310. Finally, we will use ChIP-Seq to interrogate H3K9me2 changes across the genome following SETD6 knockdown during memory consolidation and identify memory- critical genes to explain our behavioral findings. Relevance to public health: Granted that many cognitive disorders feature changes in the epigenetic control of gene expression and that NF-?B plays a known role in the epigenetic pathophysiology of cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease, the proposed experiments will begin to establish the mechanisms by which transcription factors initiate epigenetic changes in the brain. Moreover, these studies may identify new therapeutic strategies to mitigate cognitive symptoms of psychiatric conditions related to traumatic memories, such as post-traumatic stress disorders, phobias, and depression."
"9468306","Project Summary The goal of this project is to determine the timing and mechanism that govern type 1 alveolar epithelial cell (AT1) lineage specification in the developing lung. Formation of the architecturally complex gas exchange surface of the lung during early development requires precise temporal and spatial control of AT1 and type 2 alveolar cell (AT2) differentiation. Alterations in this process result in devastating developmental lung diseases. Despite our understanding of proximal airway developmental hierarchies, the distal alveolar ontogeny and mechanisms of specification are unclear. AT1 and AT2 lineages are morphologically distinct by embryonic day 17.5 and acquire highly specific functions. Thus, I hypothesize a critical phase exists before this stage, at which alveolar lineages become specified to differentiate. An AT1 cell-specific transcription co-repressor, Hopx, is first expressed, at E15.5. Hopx has been shown to repress alternative cell fate in cardiomyoblasts during development, and may play a similar role in repressing AT2 cell fate. We will test the hypothesis that AT1 lineage specification occurs at embryonic day 15.5, through Hopx-mediated repression of AT2 fate through the following aims: Aim 1 will elucidate the developmental ontogeny of AT1s by determining the developmental stage at which they become specified from progenitors, and by determining the extent of lineage plasticity between AT1s and AT2s during alveolar development. Aim 2 will define the functional role of the transcription cofactor, Hopx, in AT1 lineage specification during alveolar development by determining the phenotypic effects of loss of Hopx on the AT1 lineage and by elucidating changes in AT1 gene expression associated with loss of Hopx. Consistent with its role as a transcriptional co-repressor, Hopx is likely to repress AT2 fate by affecting AT2 gene transcription specifically in AT1s. Together, these approaches will determine the temporal control of AT1 lineage specification and elucidate a mechanism by which Hopx may drive AT1 lineage specification through repression of an AT2 transcriptional program, and, consequently, repression of AT2 cell fate."
"9405024","To understand how signaling proteins function, it is crucial to know the timeordered sequence of events that lead to the signaling state. When the messenger is chemical, the time required to diffuse to and bind in the active site of a signaling protein is typically far longer than the timescale for protein conformational change [1]. For the structural determination of the kinetics of enzymatic reactions we will focus on small GTPases and their co-enzymes. Small GTPases are molecular switches that cycle between a GTP-bound active and a GDP-bound inactive form. The switch is catalyzed by Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) and GTPase-Activating Proteins (GAPs), the latter catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP to deactivate the small GTPase. This system is of very high, general importance in cell biology with particular impact on disease processes, especially cancer, but also several infectious diseases. For proof-ofprinciple, we chose the Arl3-RP2 complex as GTPase-GAP pair [2]. The gene encoding for the GAP protein RP2 (Retinitis pigmentosa 2) is highly mutated in patients of X-linked Retinitis pigmentosa, with mutational hotspots in residues catalyzing the GAP reaction on Arl3. Retinitis pigmentosa refers to a heterogeneous group of inherited ocular diseases that result in a progressive retinal degeneration affecting 1 in 3,000?5,000 people."
"9552634","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mercury is a known neurotoxin; methylmercury is one of the most potent forms due to its ability to cross both the blood-brain and placental barriers. Unlike less toxic inorganic mercury, about 95% of dietary methylmercury is absorbed into the bloodstream, entering the hepatic portal circulation. The long, biological half-time of methylmercury (45-70 days) is attributed to extensive enterohepatic recycling, which is interrupted when methylmercury is demethylated by gut microbiota and excreted in feces. Thus gut microbial function is important to detoxification via its role in human metabolism and elimination of methylmercury. Conversely, evidence from human studies indicates not all methylmercury in the gut is demethylated, while inorganic Hg methylation by an archeon (isolated from human feces) is also possible. Inorganic mercury (or methylmercury) exposure induced changes in gut microbe communities; however data were limited to studies involving monkeys, crustaceans, and earthworms. Human studies are needed to establish bi-directional associations between gut microbiota, dietary methylmercury intake, and accumulation of methylmercury in tissues.  To address this knowledge gap, we will leverage our prospective birth and child cohort study in China, to investigate associations between prenatal/postnatal methylmercury exposure and gut microbiota assessed in children's stools. The following includes the specific aims: Aim 1. Establish the impacts of prenatal and postnatal methylmercury exposure through rice ingestion on children's neurodevelopment, evaluated using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Aim 2. Assess the relative taxonomic abundance and diversity of gut microbiota (phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels) in children's stool samples using 16S rRNA gene profiling, to investigate associations between gut microbes, methylmercury exposure (prenatal/postnatal), and other confounders. Aim 3. Establish whether variability in methylmercury metabolism and exposure corresponds to microbial detoxification via mercury resistance genes (merA and merB) quantified in children's stool samples.  Results from this study will clarify our understanding of the mechanisms by which gut microbes contribute to variability in children's methylmercury metabolism and exposure, potentially impacting offspring development."
"9501605","Summary    Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) express an invariant TCR ? chain and they can recognize self- derived as well as microbial glycolipid antigens presented by CD1d. Mice lacking iNKT cells are impaired in their early immune response against Streptococcus pneumoniae, a gram-positive bacterium responsible for pneumonia, sepsis and other diseases. We have shown that S. pneumoniae synthesizes a glycolipid that is a both a major component of their membrane and an antigen for iNKT cells. This compound is a glucosylated diacylglycerol (Glc-DAG) containing vaccenic acid, a mono-unsaturated, 18 carbon fatty acid (C18:1) with a cis unsaturated bond between carbons 9 and 10. We found an identical antigen in group B streptococcus (GBS), a  leading cause of meningitis in children, although the role of iNKT cells in defense from this pathogen remains  untested.  Our first guiding hypothesis, supported by data that are still preliminary, is that these microbial antigens are required for iNKT cell activation by S. pneumoniae. This understandably has been a controversial issue, in light of the self-reactivity of iNKT cells. Furthermore, as a second guiding hypothesis, we propose that some types of bacteria, including S. pneumoniae and GBS, avoid iNKT cell recognition of their membrane glycolipid by turning off synthesis of vaccenic acid in their hosts and by creating a molecular chimera by incorporating host oleic acid into their membrane glycolipid. Although oleic acid only differs from vaccenic acid only in the placement of the cis unsaturated bond, the Glc-DAG antigen with oleic acid cannot be recognized by iNKT cells. In the specific aims, we combine genetics, biochemistry and immune assays to demonstrate the importance of foreign antigen biosynthesis for iNKT cell activation and host defense. In Aim 2, using bacteria grown under different conditions and strains that report on unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, we will explore the timing and the organ(s) under which these two gram-positive pathogens turn off vaccenic acid synthesis, and the effect this has on the iNKT cell response and host defense in different sites, including the lung, brain, reproductive tract, as well as systemic defense. In Aim 3, we will reduce synthesis of oleic acid in infected mice, to determine if increased availability of this nutrient limits the protective iNKT cell response. In Aim 4, we explore the biochemical basis for the fine specificity of recognition of glycolipids based on the placement of the fatty acid double bond, which is buried in the CD1d antigen binding groove and therefore not directly in contact with the TCR. We also will determine if the Glc-DAG antigens with oleic acid function as effective antagonists of the Glc-DAG antigen synthesized by the bacteria.  The proposed experiments are based on our novel finding that the advantage due to metabolic saving when Strep bacteria take up host C18:1 fatty acid also provides an immune evasion mechanism. The results will have impact by providing insights into the protective responses to two important pathogens and their relationships with their hosts. The data will not only deliver a greater understanding of the requirements for iNKT cell activation, but also, they will elucidate a pathogen immune evasion mechanism that is tied to the availability of an important nutrient. The results may also have implications for understanding how diet and obesity impair a protective host response.   "
"9619100","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Next generation sequencing is gradually changing the face of human genetic studies. Instead of being largely confined to the analysis of common SNPs shared across many populations and amenable to microarray genotyping, genome-wide studies can now examine a wider range of genetic variants - including more diverse types of variation (such as insertion-deletion polymorphisms), variants specific to particular samples or populations, and rare and low frequency variants. Here, we request continued support for our genetic analysis of aging related traits - with a focus on cardiovascular risk factors - in the isolated population from the island of Sardinia, Italy. Over the next several years, we will use next-generation sequencing technology and high-throughput genotyping to study the relationship between rare genetic variation and key cardiovascular risk factors in a family sample containing ~6,000 individuals (and >30,000 close relative pairs) recruited in the Lanusei valley. As part of our planned experiments, we will evaluate problems related to the selection of samples for sequencing, the design of sequencing experiments and protocols, the analysis and curation of the resulting sequence data, and - finally - association analyses that connect the resulting variants to relevant biomedical traits. Individuals being studies are part of a longitudial study of aging and have been characterized for cardiovascular traits and outcomes, including multiple measurements of key traits such as blood lipid levels and blood pressure. We have previously studied this sample to identify common genetic variants that are associated with these cardiovascular traits and that also contribute to the risk of heart disease and obesity. Our proposed experimental plan presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the role of rare variation in this unique sample. We expect that these studies will result in experimental strategies and analysis tools that will be readily deployable by many laboratories to study the genomes of many other individuals and further our understanding of the genetics and biology of many different traits and conditions."
"9551226","Project Summary ? Kim Lentiviruses including HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV replicate in both activated CD4+ T cells and terminally- differentiated/non-dividing myeloid cells (e.g. macrophages). While HIV-1 rapidly replicates in activated CD4+ T cells, HIV-1 replication in macrophages is kinetically suppressed. Our previous studies found that macrophages harbor an extremely low dNTP concentration (20-40 nM), which kinetically restricts viral reverse transcription, and later that the host SAMHD1 dNTPase is responsible for the limited dNTP level in macrophages, which restricts HIV-1 replication. However, SIVsm and HIV-2 efficiently replicate even in macrophages due to its viral protein X (Vpx) that proteosomally degrades SAMHD1 and then elevates cellular dNTP levels in macrophages. Our long-term premise is that the extremely limited cellular dNTP pool in nondividing myeloid cells creates unique biochemical and virological features of HIV-1 replication, which directly influence viral replication kinetics, genomic diversity, evolution, and ultimately, pathogenesis of HIV-1. Our previously funded research revealed that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) uniquely displays efficient DNA synthesis capability even at the low macrophage dNTP concentrations, which enables HIV-1 to overcome the SAMHD1-mediated limited dNTPs in macrophages. However, we found that RTs from many SIV and HIV-2 strains exhibit significantly reduced DNA synthesis capability at the low macrophage dNTP concentrations, compared to HIV-1 RTs, supporting that HIV-2/SIV RTs did not evolve to be highly efficient, possibly because Vpx of these viruses elevates dNTP concentrations for their RTs in macrophages. Based on these findings, first, we hypothesize that the RT enzyme kinetics can counteract SAMHD1-mediated limited dNTP pools in the absence of Vpx. This hypothesis predicts that RT of a SIV mutant with Vpx deletion should evolve to be more efficient in DNA synthesis during the in vivo replication in animals in order to overcome the SAMHD1- mediated low dNTP pools in macrophages (as HIV-1 does). Second, ancestral non-primate lentiviruses such as FIV, BIV and EIAV also efficiently replicate in macrophages, and these ancestral lentiviruses do not encode Vpx. Here we will test whether these non-primate lentiviruses counteract their own host SAMHD1 proteins by proteosomally degrading SAMHD1 (as HIV-2/SIV do) or 2) evolving to harbor enzymatically efficient RTs (as HIV-1 does). Third, we reported that HIV-1 frequently incorporates highly abundant non-canonical/mutagenic ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) during proviral DNA synthesis, specifically in macrophages due to the limited canonical dNTP substrates. Since the incorporation of rNTPs is the most abundant DNA damages in cells and is also sequence-specific, we hypothesize that there are rNTP incorporation hot spots throughout HIV-1 genomic sequences, which become mutational hot spots and ultimately enhance HIV-1 mutagenesis in macrophages. Overall, this application aims at gaining knowledge on unique HIV-1 replication mechanism in myeloid cells that serve as long-living viral reservoirs, ultimately developing myeloid specific anti-HIV-1 agents."
"9421571","The remarkable interaction between glial cells and axons is crucial for nervous system development and homeostasis. In the PNS, the intimate relationship between axons and Schwann cells (SC) culminates with the production of the myelin sheath, a multilamellar structure that is essential to insulate the axons and ensure efficient propagation of the electric impulse. The importance of the myelin sheath is underscored by the fact that the morbidity associated to disorders of the nervous system affecting myelin formation and/or stability can lead to neuronal cell death. In recent years our understanding of the proteins and the molecular pathways required for the initiation of PNS myelination has significantly increased, however much less is known on the molecules required for the maintenance of the myelin sheath. A key signal for the entire PNS myelination program is Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) type III. We recently demonstrated that NRG1 type III canonical forward signal initiates myelination and regulates the amount of myelin formed, while the backward signal, upregulates the expression of the prostaglandin synthase L-PGDS and activates a novel pathway that is relevant to PNS myelination and maintenance. In the PNS, prostaglandins signal via two different G protein coupled receptor, GPR44 present only in SC and PTGDR that is instead expressed on SC and axons. We showed that GPR44 on SC promotes myelin formation. Our preliminary data indicate that PTGDR instead, transduces signals required for myelin stability. Thus, differential activation of these receptors might trigger distinct, but essential signals required preserving SC - axon communication. We now propose to address fundamental questions to our understanding of the role of prostaglandins in PNS myelin maintenance. Which are the proteins controlled by L-PGDS to promote myelin maintenance? What is the role of PTGDR? Is it really the GPCR transducing ?maintenance? signals? Are GPR44 and PTGDR activating different signaling pathways in SC? We will address these questions by using a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments and cutting edge technology with the aim of identifying new molecules that can be modulated to restore and/or promote myelination. A characterization of the signaling events involved in myelin maintenance is urgent and has clear translational application, as axonal suffering and neuronal cell death are the main cause of morbidity in patients with progressed demyelinating disorders."
"9470146","Project Summary This application is for a predoctoral fellowship awarded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to scientific trainees. The applicant is a trainee of the Medical Scientist Training Program at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. This award would help her achieve her career goal of becoming an academic Principal Investigator studying the relationship of sleep to neurological disease. Nearly all species exhibit increased sleep amount in early life, known as sleep ontogeny?, which is thought to facilitate brain structural maturation. Childhood sleep disturbances portend later neurocognitive deficits and are highly prevalent across neurobehavioral disorders. Further, sleep abnormalities during development may drive aberrant neural circuit formation underlying many neurobehavioral disorders. Improving sleep by targeting regulatory pathways could thus represent a new therapeutic avenue for such illnesses. However, the molecular and genetic factors regulating early life sleep remain unknown, hindering design of compelling sleep-related strategies. Sleep in the genetically accessible fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, shares many features with human sleep, including increased sleep in early life and common genetic control, suggesting conservation of ontogeny-regulating genes. We recently demonstrated that high sleep amounts in early life result from developmentally regulated changes in dopaminergic signaling. Despite knowledge of involved circuitry, the genetic factors controlling early life sleep remain unknown. The goal of this project is to use Drosophila to understand the genetic basis of sleep ontogeny. Preliminary data strongly suggests that the POU domain transcription factor, pdm3, controls sleep ontogeny. Using well-validated sleep monitoring assays and the myriad genetic techniques available in Drosophila, the role of pdm3 will be examined in two aims. Aim 1 will ascertain when during neural development pdm3 acts to control sleep ontogeny and dissect nuanced behavioral features of sleep ontogenetic change in the setting of pdm3 ablation. Aim 2 will determine circuit- specificity of pdm3 action and test the hypothesis that pdm3 is required for the cellular encoding of high sleep drive in early life. The expected results will deepen our understanding of the conserved phenomenon of sleep ontogeny, providing a platform for investigating behavioral sequelae of abnormal sleep during development and facilitating the design of novel sleep-focused treatment strategies for neurobehavioral disorders."
"9468641","Genetic evidence from neurodegenerative diseases suggests disruption in neuronal membrane and protein trafficking pathways is a major contributor to the development of disease however, the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood.1 Synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking and autophagy are two important pathways governing neuronal function that are often implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.2 Although previously considered independent, many studies have now identified additional roles of SV proteins in autophagy.3-7 For example, many Rab GTPases, major regulators of membrane trafficking, have putative roles in both SV trafficking and autophagy.15-18 A recent study has identified multiple Rab GTPases as substrates of LRRK2,12 a kinase that when hyperactive can cause the most common genetic form of PD.8-12 This suggest a mechanism whereby chronic phosphorylation may lead to dysfunction in membrane trafficking pathways and underlie PD development. In this proposal, I aim to investigate how chronic phosphorylation of Rab GTPases by LRRK2 may contribute to defects in SV cycling and autophagy found in PD. Specifically, this proposal will investigate the role of Rab10 by examining the dependence of its function in these pathways on activation state (Aim 1) and phosphorylation state (Aim2). This will be achieved using biochemical, confocal microscopy, and live imaging approaches in primary neurons from wild type and mutant mice and also through an in vivo mouse model. I hypothesize that phosphorylation by LRRK2 acts as a switch in modulating the use of Rab10 in SV cycling versus autophagy, and predict that chronic phosphorylation results in the dysfunction of these pathways as documented in PD. In Aim3, I will explore a new model system for studying human neurological diseases by generating induced neurons from patient fibroblasts. The use of this model system will not only provide a human system to study PD, but will also allow for a comparison of neuronal membrane trafficking alterations in genetic versus idiopathic PD by examining samples from both populations. Ultimately, the knowledge gained through the proposed experiments will broaden the understanding of Rab GTPases in PD and may foster the development of more targeted approaches for treating PD."

In somatic hypermutation (SHM), AID diversifies the antigen-binding repertoire of antibodies by creating initiating lesions that are converted into point mutations within the immunoglobulin loci variable region exons, the exons that encode the antigen-binding domain. In class switch recombination (CSR), AID activity in immunoglobulin heavy chain switch regions leads to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) that provide intermediates for exchange of expressed IgH constant region exons, which determine pathogen- elimination effector function.  We lack a definitive understanding of two functionally critical aspects of AID activity: how it is targeted to specific DNA regions, and how AID activity leads to different outcomes during SHM and CSR. This is a fundamental gap in our understanding of antibody maturation processes. Recent findings that the variable regions of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV (anti-HIV bnAbs) are extensively and necessarily hypermutated underscore the relevance of understanding these mechanisms.  We now propose to test the hypothesis that the DNA sequence of target substrates promotes specific AID targeting and influences the outcome of such targeting, and, in this context, to elucidate in detai the roles of particular sequences and motifs of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions exons (Aim 1) and switch regions (Aim 2). To this end, we developed a novel V(D)J passenger allele mouse model system and mutation mapping tools that efficiently measure AID mutation activity within a given DNA sequence. We will use hypotheses-driven approaches in which candidate sequence motifs are embedded in synthetic sequences and tested in our passenger allele system for effects on AID activity. In parallel, bioinformatics analyses of mutation and DSB data will be performed to discover novel motifs.  These studies should provide a wealth of basic insights into the mechanism of SHM and CSR and thus into the mechanisms that generate diverse and potent antibodies. Information will also be relevant to our understanding of off-target AID activity that contributes to oncogenic mutations and chromosomal translocations. Beyond that, proposed experiments may contribute to designing approaches to optimize immune responses such as those that promote or direct the maturation of highly mutated anti-HIV bnAbs along desired pathways."
"9455006","Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal ?FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation? is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies."
"9523414","PROJECT SUMMARY The prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng), its associated morbidity, and the emergence of untreatable strains, support a critical need for new preventative and therapeutic strategies for this important human- pathogen. Such developments require a complete understanding of the pathobiology of this archetypal, host- adapted pathogen. We show that phase-variable, glycan post-translational modifications on Ng surface appendages, pili (fimbriae), play a vital role in human infection. Complement receptor 3 (CR3) is an important pattern recognition receptor that is the key receptor mediating Ng colonization of human cervical mucosa. CR3 contains an ?I-domain? region, which is known as a binding site for protein ligands. However, we found that Ng binding to the I-domain is mediated by the pilin-linked glycan (PLG). This is a seminal finding in innate immunity, as all previous literature ascribe CR3 carbohydrate binding to a separate, so called lectin domain. This was also the first demonstration that post-translational modifications made to a bacterial protein modulate pathogenesis. These findings will impact our understanding of microbial pathogenesis and innate immune responses. The goals of the present application are to define the specific contribution of the six, naturally occurring, PLG structures in mediating the Ng-CR3 I-domain interaction and to determine the biological relevance of each of these interactions to infection in females. Guided by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that variable PLG structures initiate key, but highly divergent, outcomes with CR3 I-domain engagement. We will resolve our hypothesis through two specific aims: Aim 1) Define the effect of variation in pilin glycan structure on direct PLG-I-domain interactions; we will define the specific molecular interactions occurring with the CR3 I-domain for the six natural Ng PLG structures. Aim 2) Define the effect of PLG-I- domain interactions on Ng pathogenesis and CR3 function; we will define targeted epithelial cell responses to CR3 I-domain engagement by Ng that bear different PLG structures and their effect on Ng pathogenesis. Our approach is innovative in using biologically relevant human primary cervical cells, both alone and in co-culture with phagocytes, combined with low passage Ng isolates. This ensures that data obtained are relevant to human processes. By defining the effector functions controlled by I-domain lectin activity on primary human epithelial cells, we will provide critical new information regarding Ng pathogenesis, CR3 function, and the fundamental mechanisms that govern human cervical mucosal immunity. Moreover, we will define the utility of targeting the PLG-CR3 I-domain interaction as a new, and improved, host-targeted approach to treat and/or prevent Ng disease in women. Our studies will very likely impact work on other human pathogens and on innate immunity, broadening the significance of our outcomes. We have extensive experience in defining the molecular mechanisms of Ng pathogenesis. We are ideally placed to do this work in having discovered CR3 as the key receptor for Ng cervical infection and the biosynthetic pathways for pili glycosylation."
"9216991","Project Summary My career goals are to obtain a tenure-track faculty position and to establish a laboratory that uses quantitative approaches to elucidate complex in vivo immune regulation. The objective of my work is to understand how genetic or environment-induced variation in negative regulators can influence the sensitivity of innate immune cells to inflammatory stimuli. Research at the interface of immunology and computation promises to advance our understanding of dynamic signaling circuits that translate stimuli quality and quantity into the appropriate functional response, thus informing therapeutic strategies that target these pathways. My previous experience in assessment of in vivo immune cell activation, quantitative signaling analysis, and computational modeling puts me in an excellent position to work at the intersection of these fields. Innate immune sensing of microbial stimuli must be tightly regulated to support robust protective inflammatory responses to infection, while avoiding inflammation upon minor challenges at barrier sites. The threshold for inflammatory responses is dictated by strict control of MAPK activity. While the activating components of this pathway have been well studied, a fundamental challenge in inflammation research is to understand the negative regulation that scales these signals to facilitate quantitative decision-making within cells. Genome wide association studies have linked MAPK-regulating phosphatases with chronic inflammatory diseases of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and changes in microbiota composition in these barrier tissues are also associated with inflammatory disease. Considering the mixed success of attempts to therapeutically target MAPK in a variety of such diseases, elucidating the influence of disease-associated genetic factors and microbiota-dependent stimuli on MAPK regulation may inform treatment optimization. The objective of this proposal is to illuminate regulatory mechanisms that support quantitative control of microbe-induced signaling thresholds in macrophages and to determine whether these thresholds are distinctly regulated in barrier tissues. The studies proposed in Aim 1 will use a combination of quantitative experimental and computational modeling approaches to address the role of phosphatase regulation at the transcriptional and post-translational levels on scaling of MAPK activation dynamics. These efforts will yield insight into how changes in the expression or activity of key regulators, resulting from genetic variation, tissue-specific signals, or pharmacological manipulation, can tune macrophage sensitivity to microbial products. The experiments proposed in Aim 2 will interrogate distinct signaling tuning in barrier tissues, specifically the small intestine and lung, and will address the role of microbiota-dependent stimuli in regulation of macrophage signaling, both in the steady state and in response to minor inflammatory challenge. Tuning of macrophage signaling may play a critical role in dampening inflammatory responses in barrier tissues, and thus our efforts to elucidate regulation and dysregulation of this process will inform mechanistic links between disease-associated genetic factors, changes in the microbiota, and inflammatory disease development. While pursuing the research strategy described above, I will work with Drs. Martin Meier-Schellershiem, Michel Tremblay, and Yasmine Belkaid to gain technical skills and enhance my expertise in computational modeling, protein phosphatases, and study of the microbiota. My current mentor, Dr. Ronald Germain, has supported me in forming these collaborations and in presenting my research prominently at several international scientific meetings. These opportunities have helped me to establish my reputation as an investigator at the intersection of quantitative biology, signaling, and innate immunity transitioning to independence, and to form long-term colleagues to provide support and outside evaluation of my work during this transition. I will also seek advice from my early career mentors Drs. Peter Savage and Suzanne Gaudet, who have recently navigated the process of career transition. By supporting the completion of the proposed aims and the associated career development opportunities, this award will help me to establish the necessary foundation for additional funding and for my successful transition to scientific independence."

"9410524","Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) affects 10,000 premature infants annually with an estimated cost of $2.4 billion. Up to a third of infants with BPD go on to develop pulmonary hypertension (PH), leading to worse long-term outcomes and increased mortality. Thus far, no effective therapies have been identified for BPD- associated PH. However, data from animal models suggest that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) and extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD) may hold promise as therapeutic targets in PH. PDE5 contributes to vasoconstriction by catabolizing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a critical pulmonary vasodilator. We have previously demonstrated that oxidative stress, a key mediator in the mouse model of hyperoxic lung injury, activates PDE5 and leads to pulmonary vascular remodeling. Overexpression of the antioxidant ecSOD has been shown to protect the lung against hyperoxia in the newborn mouse.  Our published and preliminary data in the mouse model of hyperoxic lung injury demonstrates that hydrocortisone, a glucocorticoid with a known safety profile in premature infants, normalizes hyperoxia-induced PDE5 activation and increases ecSOD protein in vitro, and decreases right ventricular hypertrophy in vivo. We believe that hydrocortisone has a direct effect on the pulmonary vasculature and thus represents a novel treatment for neonatal pulmonary hypertension. Our central hypothesis is that HC reverses hyperoxia- induced changes in the pulmonary vasculature through attenuation of aberrant PDE5 activity and oxidative stress via upregulation of ecSOD. We will utilize isolated mouse pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, the murine model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury, and ecSOD knockout mice to characterize the direct effects of hydrocortisone on pulmonary vasculature and on vascular signaling pathways. These findings will lay the foundation for the use of hydrocortisone as novel therapy in pulmonary hypertension, and add new knowledge about the role of PDE5 and ecSOD in pathophysiology and treatment of BPD-associated PH.  The candidate?s long-term career goal is to become an independently funded researcher with expertise in glucocorticoid signaling and pulmonary vascular pathophysiology. The short-term goal during the award period is to elucidate the specific pathways and mechanisms by which glucocorticoids affect neonatal pulmonary vasculature. The candidate?s career development plan involves didactic and skill acquisition training, career development activities, and a mentored research experience. This innovative work will be mentored by Dr. Kathryn Farrow, an expert in pulmonary vascular biology and nitric oxide signaling pathways in the pulmonary vasculature, with additional guidance of a highly experienced advisory team. This work is complimented by the academic environment at Northwestern University, the strength of the pulmonary research being conducted in the Department of Pediatrics, and the commitment of the Division of Neonatology and the Department of Pediatrics to the support and development of junior clinician scientists."
"9529759","This project focuses on the preclinical development of a novel, and efficient non-invasive therapeutic strategy to test the delivery of low-dose of carbon monoxide (CO) using a CO-releasing molecule 401 (CORM401) for the treatment of TBI etiopathology commonly observed in young active adults and also in the elderly. Contrary to the traditional view of CO as a toxic agent, we were among the pioneer to show that CO can be neuroprotective at low doses. Knowing from our previous studies that exposure to CO beginning immediately after a brain insult is protective in transient and also in permanent focal cerebral ischemia models, we now plan to investigate whether CORM401 has similar remarkable neuroprotective effect. Here, we will determine the optimal doses and therapeutic window for CORM401 treatment, along with its inactive control (iCORM401). We combine effort with our collaborator who has been a pioneer in the development and test of CORMs.  We now propose to test CORM401 since it would not have the toxicity associated with the other CORMs based on their transition metals and also because if can release up to three molecule of CO as compared to only one.  We hypothesize that CORM401 would have therapeutic effect to decrease lesion size, hippocampal edema, and behavioral deficits in the controlled-cortical impact TBI model, and whether this beneficial effect would be at least partially due to the Nrf2 contribution, known as a master cytoprotective pathway leading to the upregulation of various protective proteins, which would result to a ?positive feed-forward mechanism? for neuroprotection.  Thus, the Aim 1 is to determine whether CORM401 post-treatment is sufficient to reduce anatomical and functional deficits after TBI and whether the beneficial outcomes would be sustained in older (18-20mo) animals as compared to younger ones (3-3.5mo). The Aim 2 is to investigate the beneficial CORM401 mechanism of action and determine whether Nrf2 pathway is at least partially responsible for such neuroprotection. Various anatomical, functional, and brain imaging outcomes will be investigated blindly after such acute brain trauma.  The novelty of our study resides notably in our unique team experience in this field and in the potential therapeutic use of CO, recognizing that that both physicians and regulatory bodies remain rather skeptical, we have now focused on testing the ?improved? CO-releasing molecule, i.e. CORM401. We also selected the CORM401 vs its inactive control to rigorously test our hypothesis and to further monitor potential side effects since it does not have the toxicity associated with other CORMs and also because it can release more CO. Such an intriguing hypothesis is timely, innovative and needs to be tested first in such proposed preclinical model to move forward, and it holds the potential to unmask therapeutic strategies and new mechanisms against young and older male and female adult brain trauma."
"9449167","ABSTRACT Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly population. While several peptide and protein biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been used for AD diagnosis, an unequivocal diagnosis in the early phases of AD is still lacking. Perhaps more importantly, the discovery and establishment of reliable biomarkers capable of monitoring progression and degree of cognitive impairment as well as potential efficacy of therapy remains a major challenge. Furthermore, the correlation between CSF protein/peptide biomarkers and changes in the brain structure/function and cognition is not well established. In order to address these challenges and fill in existing knowledge gaps, we propose to employ a multi-faceted approach combining a suite of mass spectrometry-based technologies enabled by innovative multiplexed tagging strategies, bioinformatics tools and clinically-available measures to discover, identify and evaluate potential biomarkers of AD in CSF obtained from asymptomatic cognitively-healthy middle-aged adults, older cognitively-normal adults, and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. We propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 ? To conduct in-depth analysis of site-specific glycoproteome and endogenous glycopeptidome in CSF from subjects in control, preclinical, MCI, AD groups, respectively. Specific Aim 2 ? To discover and identify a panel of candidate glycoprotein/glycopeptide biomarkers at different stages of AD using multiplexed dimethylated leucine (DiLeu) reagents-enabled quantitative glycoproteomics approach along with machine learning classification algorithms for improved diagnosis of AD. Specific Aim 3 ? To validate the CSF AD biomarkers, in plasma samples collected from individuals with MCI and dementia, using targeted quantitative proteomics approaches and ELISA assay along with association with AD-related clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging measures. This project uniquely integrates advances in MS-based multiplexed quantitative glycoproteomics and bioinformatics tools with neuroimaging and clinical measures to enable more comprehensive discovery and validation of CSF biomarkers in AD.  The proposed research will be performed in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team of investigators including Drs. Cynthia Carlsson, Henrik Zetterberg, Ozioma Okonkwo and David Page. This multifaceted approach will enable identification of biomarkers of AD in CSF that offer improved sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and predict dementia onset and progression. These biomarkers would be invaluable in designing therapeutics for patient care and more efficient clinical trials of disease modifying therapies. The advances in technology and new insights will have broad impact on translational medicine."
"9467333","SUMMARY Effective management of obstructive pulmonary diseases characterized by thickened, highly viscoelastic mucus represents a significant unmet medical need, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) an inherited disease affecting approximately 30,000 individuals in the US. In CF, genetic dysfunction of the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator) trans-membrane channel results in impaired mucociliary transport and defective mucus clearance that drives a cycle of chronic infection and inflammation leading to impaired lung function and death. New CFTR modulator therapies can restore a degree of CFTR functionality, but these are limited to certain CF genotypes, are prone to side-effects, and provide only marginal disease modification. Hence, large treatment gaps remain. Our approach is designed to target all CF patients via an inhaled enzyme-based treatment (ORP-100) that restores a native airway mechanism for maintenance of normal mucus protein viscosity and stiffness that is lost when airways become acidified due to loss of CFTR-mediated bicarbonate efflux. ORP100 is an engineered variant of human thioredoxin, a selective and specific protein disulfide reductase that is a highly potent normalizer of mucin (mucus protein) disulfide bonds. It is hypothesized that low pH inactivates the thioredoxin substitute cofactor glutathione, thus interfering with regeneration of active thioredoxin in the CF airway. ORP-100 is delivered in a pre-activated form that does not depend on glutathione and has been engineered to bind covalently to mucin disulfide bonds. This both increases potency through prevention of disulfide re-formation and enhances safety via sequestration of the drug in the mucus layer. Our prior work has demonstrated that ORP-100 has a superior ability to normalize CF patient mucus/sputum viscoelasticity vs. native human thioredoxin, as well as the approved mucolytic drugs N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and inhaled human DNase (Dornase alfa, Pulmozyme®). Most significantly, ORP-100 is twice as active as DNase in restoring mucociliary transport to CF sputum applied in situ to rat tracheae, a state of the art model for evaluating efficacy of mucus drugs. We have established a scalable and efficient ORP-100 manufacturing process in E. coli and initial storage and delivery formulations that confer oxidative stability. Acute aerosol inhalation of ORP-100 in rats showed no toxicity at 40 mg/kg, many times greater than the anticipated human dose, with potential anti-inflammatory effects observed in rodents in vivo as well as in vitro in primary human bronchial epithelia from CF donors. In Phase 1 of this Fast-Track project we will focus on establishment of sensitive bioanalytical assays for quantification of ORP-100 in matrices from rat and monkey, and development of aerosols to facilitate inhalation toxicology studies. A successful outcome will enable in Phase 2 the analysis of formulation stability, evaluation of ORP-100 compatibility with the eFlow nebulizer device, and repeat-dose inhalation studies in rat and non-human primate species to provide dose-proportionality and toxicology data as essential prerequisites to IND-enabling GLP toxicology and subsequent human clinical trials."

Addition of an analytical chemistry core to this center will enhance the biomedical and non-biomedical projects by providing state-of-the-art analytical support to monitor and quantify organic contaminant levels which can aid in identifying mechanisms of developmental toxicity. Adding the support of an ACC will provide the means of evaluating key relationships between exposures and body burdens, which will help determine what the potential biological costs of early life exposures are for both humans and ecosystems; and furthermore, to determine whether or not remediation strategies are effective or if they increase these costs. The ACC will provide services for routine analyses of samples for organophosphate pesticides (e.g. chlorpyrifos), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and brominated flame  retardants (e.g. polybrominated diphenyl ethers) levels.

"9617572","Project Abstract Neoplasms of the choroid plexus (CP) are rare primary brain tumors predominantly found in childhood. CP tumors range from the more common and benign CP papilloma (CPP), to the rare CP carcinoma (CPC) that is poorly understood but highly lethal. Treatments for CPC include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy that cause severe long term side effects in survivors. Development of more effective and less debilitating therapies for CPC has been hampered by limited knowledge of the role of specific molecular defects, including abnormal NOTCH signaling and recurrent genomic alterations, in CPC. Insights into how these genes and pathways affect proliferation and growth of CPC will lead to targets for new therapies that can specifically suppress tumor growth without deleterious effects on the developing brain. By inducing sustained NOTCH1 expression, we developed mouse models of CP tumor that recapitulate CPP in humans. Lineage studies revealed that NOTCH-induced CPP originates from roof plate progenitors, both of which exhibit active NOTCH signaling and undergo proliferation driven by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) from CP epithelium. In contrast, CP epithelial cells with clustered multiple primary cilia on the apical surface fail to respond to SHH, suggesting that the NOTCH pathway suppresses multi-ciliogenesis to preserve the singular primary cilium critical for the SHH signaling. Though key genes of the multi-ciliation network driven by Geminin coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1 (GEMC1) are expressed in CP epithelium, the transcriptional program is suppressed in NOTCH-activated CPP that lacks multi-ciliated cells. Conversely, GEMC1 loss results in the lack of multi-ciliation in the CP. In Aim 1, we will investigate GEMC1-directed multi-ciliate differentiation during CP development and tumorigenesis. We will determine whether activation of GEMC1 transcriptional cascade is sufficient to overcome constitutive NOTCH signaling to induce multi-ciliogenesis, and attenuate SHH signaling in CP tumor. Functional studies of GEMC1 and identification of its transcriptional targets will establish the molecular mechanisms of multi-ciliation in the CP, and uncover potential therapeutic venues for CP tumor. Consistent with abnormal SHH and NOTCH signaling in CP tumor in humans, simultaneous activation of both pathways in mice leads to malignant CP tumors that exhibit solitary primary cilium. Similarly, CPCs in humans are characterized by singular primary cilium and recurrent genomic alterations affecting crucial regulators of multi-ciliate differentiation. In Aim 2, we will utilize novel mouse models to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the genetic interaction between the NOTCH and SHH pathways and evaluate potential targeted therapeutics. We will determine whether the loss of GEMC1 drives CPC in collaboration with constitutive SHH signaling. The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of CPC and identify potential therapeutic targets."
"9448401","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Pathologic hemorrhage is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality for both the general population as well as individuals with bleeding disorders. While major improvements to human health have been made with blood products and human derived or recombinant coagulation factors, these have limited shelf life and storage conditions, and require intravenous infusion. There are exceedingly few potent and stable conventional pharmaceutical agents for treatment of hemorrhage, and there is a strong need for the identification of new therapeutics and targets. This project will leverage highly innovative technologies, including genome editing nucleases, next generation sequencing, and the zebrafish model to delve into the evolutionary conservation of hemostasis, and use this information to conduct an in vivo high throughput analysis of small molecules and genetic targets for treatment of a hemorrhagic phenotype. In preliminary studies, we have used robust genome editing nucleases (TALENS and CRISPR/Cas) to generate mutations in procoagulant factors. These mutants display bleeding phenotypes and lethality, correlating with data from mammals. In Specific Aim 1, we will use genome editing nuclease to evaluate combinatorial actions of multiple coagulation factors for suppression of a model of hemorrhage. In Specific Aim 2 we will perform a high throughput small molecule screen to detect lead compounds for treatment of hemorrhage, and a sensitized ENU mutagenesis suppressor screen to identify potential modifier genes as new therapeutic targets. These studies will discern interactions amongst candidate modifiers as well as perform an unbiased screen for novel therapeutic drugs and target genes. This will lead to potential innovative agents and therapeutic classes for treatment of hemorrhage that could benefit the general population, as well as patients with bleeding disorders."
"9250664","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among the most controversial aspects of the U.S. health care system are the impacts of the medical malpractice system on patient treatments and health care costs. The structure of malpractice protections under the Military Health System (MHS) provides a novel opportunity to understand how the presence of malpractice pressure leads to defensive medicine. The MHS provides what is missing in previous studies: a true treatment group of patients whose physicians face no malpractice pressure. Under federal law, active duty physicians who treat active duty military patients at military facilities cannot be sue for malpractice. However, malpractice laws do apply to their treatment of dependents and retirees treated at these same facilities. Similarly, malpractice laws apply to physicians treating active duty military patients outside military facilities. By comparing patients whose physicians are not subject to defensive medicine pressure to other comparable patients (perhaps even treated by the same physician) whose physicians are subject to such pressure, we can identify the impact of defensive medicine pressure on practice patterns, medical costs, and patient outcomes. Central to our research aims is the availability of perhaps the richest data ever used to address these issues. The MHS has provided us with a complete set of records on medical treatment and outcomes for the entire universe of active duty personnel, dependents, and retirees, over a number of years. This enormous set of data includes usual claims-based measures of utilization data, as well as measures such as patient wait times, patient satisfaction, mortality, and biometric outcomes. We use these data to address four aims:  ? What is the impact of the MHS malpractice exemption on treatment during malpractice sensitive episodes of treatment such as cardiac care or obstetrics?  ? How does the malpractice exemption impact total medical spending?  ? How does the malpractice exemption impact the quality of care delivered?  ? Are there spillovers across protected and unprotected patients through physician styles? We will address these aims both through difference-in-differences comparisons of comparable patients with differential protection from malpractice laws, and through causal regression models that exploit features such as distance-based rules on who must be treated at military facilities and changes in malpractice protection across physicians and patients."
"9444976","Clinical and epidemiological studies show a robust, inverse association of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. However, raising HDL-C does not seem to provide therapeutic benefits, indicating that HDL-C levels are not a reliable measure of the cardio-protective effects of HDL. Moreover, the relationship between HDL-C and stroke risk is not clear with studies showing an inverse, direct, or lack of association. Recently, in mostly white cohorts, the cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) of HDL correlated with both the prevalence and incidence of CHD independently of plasma levels of HDL-C and APOA1 (the major structural protein of HDL). On the other hand, increased HDL CEC was associated with increased stroke risk. Our preliminary data show no association between stroke risk and plasma HDL-C levels but a robust reduction in HDL CEC in stroke patients indicates that HDL's function might be a more relevant metric for assessing the stroke risk. Moreover, our preliminary results suggest that although African Americans have higher HDL-C levels they suffer from greater CHD risk, therefore, it is imperative to determine if HDL CEC associates with CHD risk better than HDL-C. We propose to determine if measures of HDL CEC do indeed provide value for CHD or stroke risk prediction in a racially balanced cohort. Studies in mostly white cohorts highlight that changes in HDL function are a reflection of changes in the HDL proteome. Therefore, identification of the protein cargo signature responsible for loss of HDL CEC in a bi- racial cohort may provide biomarkers of clinical validity that indicate CHD or stroke risk tailored to each race. To evaluate the predictive value of sterol efflux capacity of HDL and the protein signature that associates with dysfunctional HDL, we will use a case-control cohort (with 1000 each healthy, stroke and CHD cases) within The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study. This is a NIH-sponsored national, longitudinal study of risk factors for stroke in over 30,000 African-American and Caucasian American men and women over 45 years of age, with a high prevalence of stroke and CHD. Due to unique composition of the REGARDS population we will be able to determine the impact of race and sex on our measures. Our preliminary data in mice using the 100-strain Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, developed by our collaborator, Dr. Jake Lusis of UCLA, successfully identified significant QTLs that modulate sterol efflux. It is therefore important to understand whether genetic mapping of sterol efflux trait identifies new CHD and stroke- related polymorphisms in humans. The data produced by this study would 1) determine the impact of race and sex on HDL function and the HDL proteome, 2) form the basis for development of clinical assays for assessing the role of HDL in cardiovascular disease, 3) facilitate race-specific prediction of CHD and stroke risk."

Innate immune detection of LPS in the cytosol via inflammatory caspases (4,5 and 11) elicits three distinct outcomes; proteolytic maturation of caspase-1, IL-1?, and IL-18, pyroptosis, unconventional secretion of intracellular proteins, which lack leader sequence for secretion via classical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi route. Upon extracellular release, several of these proteins are believed to act as alarmins or damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and can both incite and modulate ongoing immune responses. Thus, alarmins and DAMPs play substantial roles in shaping inflammatory responses and tissue repair during infectious diseases, sepsis and trauma. However, the unconventional protein secretion as a consequence of caspase-11 activation by cytosolic LPS is poorly characterized. The overall goal of this study is to profile alarmins released as a consequence of caspase-11 activation by cytosolic LPS. Importantly, we will characterize the secretion and function of a novel alarmin identified in our preliminary studies in regulating innate immune responses during bacterial infections and sepsis. Overall, the findings of this study will provide critical insights into pathogenic mechanisms in sepsis and potentially identify new biomarkers and targets to intervene in sepsis."
"9624841","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ?15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice."
"9415253","Summary Accurate control of genome replication initation is essential for genome stability. In particular, organisms with multiple replication origins per chromosome must ensure that initiation of DNA replication at each origin is highly regulated. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle circuitry controls initiation by a complex series of post- translation modifications. The manner in which these modifications impinge upon the function of the replication apparatus is an area of active research and much remains to be discovered. We have previously shown that archaea of the genus Sulfolobus possess three replication origins per chromosomes and each fires once in every cell cycle. In the current proposal we describe a series of experiments to investigate the control of loading and activation of the conserved MCM replication helicase. In eukaryotic chromosomes, all replication start sites are defined by binding of the origin recognition complex, ORC that ultimately directs the position of loading of the MCM helicase. Given their central role in replication it is not surprising that components of ORC, such as Orc1, are essential genes in eukaryotes. Orc1 is evolutionarily conserved in the archaeal domain of life. The chromosomes of archaea of the genus Sulfolobus contain three replication origins that are defined by distinct initiator proteins. Furthermore none of the Sulfolobus Orc1-like initiators are essential for viability. This mosaic nature of the Sulfolobus chromosome provides a unique tool with which to dissect the mode of action of the conserved Orc1 proteins in living cells. We will exploit this tool to perform genetic biochemical and dissections of the role of Orc in MCM loading in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, our preliminary data reveal the existence of positive control of the MCM helicase by phosphorylation and we will determine the basis of this activation of the helicase. In addition to establishing novel paradigms for prokaryotic DNA replication, our work will serve as a model for the fundamentally related, yet organizationally more complex, eukaryotic DNA replication apparatus."
"9395945","Project Abstract Numerous studies have documented a role for inherited genetic variation in common chronic diseases, their risk factors and overall longevity. However, the distributions and incidence rates of these same conditions have changed dramatically during modern times (1946-2014); a shift too dramatic in too short of a period to be affected by evolutionary pressures leading to changes in allele frequencies. Rather, this shift is most likely accounted for by changes in health care and lifestyle, which, in turn, have led to increased longevity and opening the door to successful aging. Lifestyle changes and aging itself can lead to alterations in the action of relevant genes via epigenetic modification of the DNA. This proposed research will test the hypotheses that signatures of DNA methylation measured in the blood of middle-aged adults are associated with successful aging patterns later in life (Aim 1); that these signatures persist in old age (Aim 2); and these signatures are associated with subsequent differences in the expression level of relevant genes (Aim 3). Replication opportunities have been identified and are an integral part of the workscope. We will focus on the overall construct of successful aging (i.e., physical, cognitive and functional well-being) instead of any one disease entity or risk factor for both scientific (i.e., pleiotropy) and practical (impact on quality of life) reasons. We will use the Level II definition of successful aging proposed and validated by McLaughlin et al in the Health and Retirement Study. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, a biracial longitudinal cohort study of the development of atherosclerosis and its risk factors, has collected and stored biosamples at each of its previous five examinations, and measured blood biomarkers and DNA sequence variation in successful searches for predictors of disease risk. This proposed ancillary study will support measurement of epigenetic patterns associated with successful aging. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1) To identify signatures of DNA methylation measured in the blood of middle-aged adults that are associated with successful aging status later in life; 2) To determine whether DNA methylation signatures of successful aging established in middle age among 1,800 ARIC participants from Aim 1 persist ~21 years later when they reach old age; 3) To examine whether the DNA methylation status of the genes identified in middle age (Aim 1) is correlated with gene expression in old age. The long-term goal of the proposed project is that by increasing our understanding of the biological determinants and trajectory of successful aging, this study may help to inform public health interventions focused on modifiable risk factors and the development of new therapeutic agents that will make successful aging an attainable goal for a greater number of individuals in the population."
"9487869","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         It is estimated that there will be 140,430 new diagnoses of urogenital cancers and 30,000 associated deaths in 2013. Metastatic progression is the primary cause of cancer-related death. Managing care for cancer patients with progressive disease is an arduous challenge and poses an increasing financial burden on our medical institutions. Therefore, is imperative that we elucidate the molecular mechanisms that drive metastasis and identify clinical biomarkers that can specifically recognize invasive disease and rapidly assess therapeutic response. Fluid-based biomarkers are ideal for disease surveillance and therapeutic monitoring because they allow for non-invasive, repetitive sampling. The clinical impact of such a biomarker would be multifaceted by reducing healthcare costs, reducing toxicities associated with ineffective drugs, and improving the implementation of drug trials. In summary, successful implementation of active monitoring for recurrence and rapid identification of treatment response is synonymous with reducing morbidity, mortality, and the associated health care cost."
"9572677","Vascular cognitive impairment & dementia (VCID) is defined as a form of dementia that is triggered by damage to cerebral blood vessels or cerebrovascular disease. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which is accumulation of amyloid ß-protein (Aß) within and along primarily small and medium-sized arteries and arterioles of the brain and in the cerebral microvasculature, is a common cerebral vascular condition that can cause VCID in the elderly. Not surprisingly, with the involvement of Aß, CAA is the most common vascular comorbidity found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Although there is evidence that both parenchymal plaque amyloid and cerebral microvascular amyloid can contribute to dementia in patients with AD and related disorders, there is growing recognition that the latter is a potent driver of cognitive impairment. Yet, the reasons as to why cerebral vascular amyloid forms and its contribution to downstream pathologies and early cognitive impairment remain unclear.  Altered copper homeostasis has been considered an important factor in the neurodegenerative diseases. Earlier findings suggest that copper may play an important role in the formation of amyloid deposits and in subsequent neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. However, relatively little is known about the accumulation of copper in cerebral vascular amyloid deposits, which are associated with early-onset VCID. Thus, the overall hypothesis of our proposal is that copper plays a role in driving fibrillar amyloid assembly in CAA and that the subsequent accumulation of copper in the cerebrovascular amyloid deposits promotes downstream pathologies and early- onset cognitive impairment. In order to test this hypothesis we propose to three specific aims. First, we will determine if vascular amyloid deposits exhibit high levels of copper compared to parenchymal amyloid plaques in post mortem human brain tissue samples of AD, sporadic CAA and familial CAA patients and in transgenic mouse models. Second, we will investigate the effects of copper on Aß fibril assembly. Third, we will determine the effects of increasing or reducing copper levels on the development of CAA, downstream pathologies and cognitive impairment in Tg-SwDI mice.  Currently, there are no effective therapies or reliable biomarkers specifically for CAA. These deficiencies are complicated by our lack of understanding of the assembly and unique structural attributes of cerebral vascular amyloid and their distinctive features that lead to CAA formation and subsequent pathologies. The present proposal, focused on the role of copper in these events, will seek to fill this critical void in our knowledge and will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of CAA and provide insight into the development of novel diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic interventions for CAA and VCID."
"9564366","PROJECT SUMMARY The adaptive immune system has the capacity to respond to a virtually limitless array of pathogens and environmental threats. The extensive molecular diversity required to recognize such varied targets is generated through the rearrangement and combinatorial association of antigen receptor gene segments in T and B lymphocytes. The DNA sequence of these variable gene segments determines the antigen specificity of encoded heterodimeric T cell receptors and B cell immunoglobulins. Although an immune response is not dictated by specificity alone, the antigen receptor serves as the principal site for lymphocyte recognition and engagement, directly linking this complex set of genetic information to functions in host defense, vaccination, and autoimmunity. Therefore, a comprehensive sequence inventory of the immunoglobulin and T cell receptor repertoire is a key step towards understanding, and perhaps manipulating, the adaptive immune response. However, determining the distinct sequences of diverse antigen receptor genes within a complex lymphocyte population presents a number of challenges, most notably in acquiring paired sequence information for both of the subunit chains that contribute to the specificity of the heterodimeric antigen receptor. The goal of this application is to develop a high throughput strategy that overcomes these challenges and enables sequence analysis of paired antigen receptor subunits. Using a combination of molecular biology, microfluidics technology, and high throughput sequencing, I will establish an effective method for rapidly profiling T cell receptor and B cell immunoglobulin sequences. This approach will be used for molecular and functional studies of the lymphocyte repertoire in the steady-state and in response to antigenic challenge. It will also be used to investigate the contribution of particular antigen receptor specificities to autoimmune pathogenesis in a model of systemic lupus erythematosus. These studies will significantly advance our understanding of the adaptive immune system in health and disease. Furthermore, the tools developed in this project will have broad utility for studying immune function in areas such as infection, vaccination, and autoimmunity. They can also be adapted for profiling complex populations at single cell resolution in a wide variety of biological systems."
"9446768","Project Summary/Abstract  A major obstacle in organ transplantation is the immunological response against donor tissue grafts. Both major (MHC) and minor histocompatibility antigens (mAgs) are known to elicit targeted rejection, and even when a donor's and recipient's MHC antigens are matched, mAgs can elicit graft rejection. In addition, mismatched mAgs are generated in many other settings, such as during tumorigenesis or induction of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet radiation. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which the immune system recognizes and clears cells expressing mismatches of mAg has broad scientific and translational utility.  The rejection of mAg-mismatched cells is complex, involving both adaptive (T cells and B cells) and innate (dendritic cells (DC) and antigen-presenting monocytes) branches of the immune system. To date, it is poorly understood how endogenous antigen-presenting cells recognize, coordinate and induce an immunological response against mAg-mismatched cells, particularly in the absence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Preliminary experiments in our laboratory suggest that there is almost no redundancy in the role individual endogenous APC subtypes play to coordinate the rejection of mAg- mismatched cells. Multiple APC subtypes play unique roles in mounting an immune response against mAg- mismatched cells, and blocking any link in the cascade of events should abolish the response against mAg- mismatched cells. If we can better understand the sequential cellular cascade that leads to mAg-mismatched cell rejection, then we can design drugs to target specific cell types and signaling pathways to improve the outcome of transplantation and other adverse diseases.  What is novel and most striking about the immunological response we propose to investigate is that the induction of adaptive immunity against mAgs occurs without external stimuli (i.e. PAMPs). Therefore, in Aim 1, we will investigate the role of B cells and the endogenous molecules they secrete to alert the immune system to the presence of mismatches of mAg on cells. We hypothesize that the initial molecule that binds and coats adoptively transferred mAg-mismatched cells are natural IgM antibodies, resulting in the formation of an immune complex. In Aim 2 we will examine the mechanisms by which a cellular immune complex is acquired by Irf4+ DCs and/or Ly6C+ monocytes. In addition, we will examine how the acquisition of an immune complex activates and licenses Irf4+ DCs and/or Ly6C+ monocytes to present mAg in an immunogenic way to CD4+ T cells. Subsequently, we will investigate how these activated effector mAg-specific CD4+ T cells help license Batf3+ DCs via CD40 to cross-present cell-associated mAgs and prime cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which is ultimately required to complete the process of mAg-mismatched cell rejection. All in all, the accomplishment of our proposed aims will constitute a significant advance in our in vivo understanding of the cellular and molecular events and mechanisms that regulate the rejection of cells expressing altered minor antigens."
"9624837","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 14% of men will be diagnosed with Prostate Cancer (PCa). Not only is PCa very prevalent, but as the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in men, it is also very deadly. Many of these deaths result from resistance to androgen ablation therapy, defined as Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). The median survival for men with CRPC is only 19 months, emphasizing the need for further research for novel CRPC therapeutics. Many PCas become resistant to androgen ablation therapy through reactivation of the Androgen Receptor (AR). AR is a transcription factor that translocates into the nucleus after being bound by androgens and promotes transcription of many genes, several of which code for metabolic proteins that regulate lipid and protein biosynthesis. Following androgen ablation therapy, the androgen supply is decreased and growth of the cancer slows down due to decreased AR activity, but cells almost certainly develop resistance through reactivation of AR. We have strong preliminary data suggesting that the cell surface receptor Ron tyrosine kinase is important in activating AR in PCa, leading to resistance to androgen ablation therapy. Previous studies established the Ron receptor as a critical player in PCa. Ron expression levels in PCa correlate with disease severity and loss of Ron signaling in the Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate model of PCa severely reduces primary tumor growth. Together, these data demonstrate that Ron is not only highly expressed, but plays a functional role in promoting PCa. In regards to promoting CRPC, it was observed that Ron overexpression was sufficient to drive resistance to androgen ablation therapy by overexpressing Ron in androgen sensitive murine Myc-CaP cells in a murine model of CRPC. Prostate tumors with Ron overexpressing Myc-CaP cells display elevated AR activation and require AR to provide growth in androgen depleted conditions. Further, Ron was shown to activate AR in an epithelial cell specific manner. We also identified enhanced macrophage recruitment in Ron OE Myc-CaP tumors and show mechanistically that macrophage conditioned media induces AR activation in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a non-cell autonomous role for macrophages in promoting Ron mediated castration resistant growth. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to define the mechanisms by which Ron signaling promotes CRPC. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that Ron signaling promotes CRPC through activation of AR by both cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. In aim 1 we will determine the mechanism by which cell intrinsic Ron expression promotes CRPC by examining the ability of Ron to directly and indirectly induce AR activation. Aim 2 will test the function of Ron in regulating macrophage infiltration and activation status. This research may have important clinical implications for the treatment of patients with CRPC by providing the scientific underpinnings for targeting the Ron receptor to combat resistance to androgen ablation therapy."
"9442361","Our long term goal is to elucidate the cellular mechanism of tau toxicity, in the context of its biological function in the cell and the mechanism of tau transmission from cell to cell. We have previously shown that tau hyperphosphorylation at position 199, 212, 231 and 262, combined with the FTDP-17 mutation at the carboxyl terminus of the protein, R406W (termed here Pathological Human tau or PH-Tau) are critical for inducing a conformational change in the protein that makes it mimics the abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau from AD brain. We and others have shown that hyperphosphorylated tau from AD brains disrupts microtubules and behaves as a prion-like protein because it binds normal tau and self-aggregates in bundles of filaments. PH- Tau shares those toxic properties with pathological tau from AD patients. Abnormal tau in AD brains can be found in neurons, aggregated in filaments or soluble, as well as in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a naked protein or in vesicles called exosomes. Tau uptake by different cells has been reported in vivo and in vitro. In our preliminary experiments, membrane zeiosis, or blebbing, can be observed in cells transfected with PH-Tau. Using co-cultures we found that PH-Tau can be secreted from cells and taken up by the neighboring cells. This phenomenon seems to be selective for different cell types. Besides tau function inside the neurons, tau has been reported to interact with and activate muscarinic receptors. The propagation of tau between neurons and the effects of this abnormal protein in the neurons is a key factor in the progression of AD and other tauopathies and a better understanding will play a large role in developing therapeutics.  We hypothesize that changes in tau phosphorylation induces a concomitant alteration in tau conformation and biological properties, and that this modified protein gets secreted from neurons and transferred to neighboring neurons. Through this transfer mechanism, the abnormal tau can infect normal neurons in a prion-like fashion. The uptake of PH-Tau can disrupt the cytoskeleton, affect synaptic proteostasis and trigger the neurodegeneration process with a negative impact on cognitive functions and memory. This proposal will investigate the mechanism and the consequences of tau uptake by other neurons in tau transmission in vitro and in vivo by:) To determine whether vesicular, exosomal or secreted PH-Tau will transfer toxicity to healthy cells in culture and 2) Compare the spread of lentiviral expressed tau and PH-Tau in vivo.  Experiments designed in this proposal will shed new light on the transmission of tau toxicity and new putative therapeutical targets. These experiments will also provide rich training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate underrepresented students, from the College of Staten Island primarily by providing support for doctoral and Master?s students."
"9519413","ABSTRACT The broad long-term goal of this application is to identify innate and T helper (Th) cell transcriptomic signatures of immune response and further our understanding of sex-dependent human immune responses to two unique influenza A/H3N2 vaccines in a population of older adult males and females. We will comprehensively measure the spectrum of innate and adaptive (CD4+T helper cell) immune responses to the recently FDA- licensed MF59-adjuvanted influenza subunit vaccine (MF59Flu) and the high-dose split influenza virus vaccine (HDFlu) using a systems biology approach, combined with detailed clinical and laboratory immunophenotyping in a well-characterized cohort (65 years of age and older). Early innate immune responses are critical to the development of robust adaptive immunity that confers protection upon re-exposure to influenza. Likewise, Th responses provide T cell help essential for the establishment of protective humoral immunity. Little is known about the effect of sex on innate and Th helper responses following these influenza vaccines. In this application, we propose two parallel Specific Aims (one focused on innate immune responses and the other on CD4+Th responses to these two vaccines). Our Aims will test the following hypotheses: 1) that vaccine type (MF59Flu vs HDFlu) and/or sex are associated with variations in innate and Th cell immune response; 2) that the increased Ag dose in HDFlu results in greater activation/suppression of the genes/genesets previously associated with immune responses to standard dose influenza vaccine; 3) that the MF59 adjuvant results in activation/suppression of additional genes/genesets compared to HDFlu; 4) that transcriptomic signatures (gene expression patterns associated with immune responses) mediate the association of vaccine type (or sex) with immune outcomes; and 5) that the innate or Th cell immune outcomes and corresponding transcriptomic signatures will predict markers of humoral immunity (HAI titer and memory B cell ELISPOT response). Completion of these Specific Aims will allow us to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which MF59Flu and HDFlu enhance innate and Th immune responses in older persons at high risk of influenza disease, identify specific genesets involved in sex-based differences in immune response, and may allow the identification of new correlates of vaccine immunogenicity."
"9453364","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Affordable high-throughput genome sequencing technologies had been expected to usher an era of precision medicine, whereby each patient receives an individualized treatment based on their genetic profile. However, precision medicine is yet to realize this potential and the number of clinically applied drug biomarkers lags far behind the number proposed in the scientific literature. Lack of reproducibility of proposed biomarkers has been highly problematic, and in particular the lack of effectiveness of biomarkers identified in pre-clinical studies when applied in clinical trial. In cancer, the number of drugs with FDA approved biomarkers remains at less than 30, and almost all of these arose because a drug was designed to target a specific known driver gene. Overall, only a handful of clinically actionable biomarkers have been discovered for drugs already in use. The objective of this project is to develop computational methods that will improve on existing biomarker discovery, and ultimately improve patient care and survival. My first aim is to develop an approach that will allow me to impute drug sensitivity in very large clinical datasets, such as TCGA. This imputed data will then be compared to measured markers in these data (e.g. somatic mutations) in order to identify novel predictors of drug response. The statistical models used to impute drug sensitivity will be developed in a pre-clinical disease model, where drug response has been accurately measured. In my second aim I will quantify the contribution of germline genetic variation to drug response in cancer. ?Germline genetic variation? refers to the common genetic differences that exist between individuals, which are for the most part preserved in tumors. The contribution of this inter-individual genetic variation to variability in drug response between patients remains unquantified, although it is becoming clearer that it plays an important role. Finally, I will combine the information gathered in the first steps and build effective integrative models of drug response. Following the R00 phase (R01 and beyond), I envision that such models will be tested in patients; subsequently, measured drug response in these cohorts will be used to further refine future predictions. This will result in a framework where models actively improve their predictive performance as more data is gathered over time. To ensure the success of this project, I have assembled an expert mentorship team for the K99 phase, which includes a statistician, wet-lab biologists and clinicians, thus covering the entire scope of the precision medicine discovery and implementation pipeline. The University of Chicago, a world-class research institution, will provide the ideal environment and resources for such a cross-disciplinary, collaborative endeavor."
"9405526","Project Summary/Abstract Imaging plays a critical role in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of neuroblastoma (NB). Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is extensively used for imaging NB and is recommended for staging and follow-up of NB. In this early-phase study, we are evaluating a novel radiotracer, meta-fluorobenzylguanidine, or 18F-MFBG. We hypothesize that imaging with this positron-labeled analog of MIBG will provide a more convenient single-day imaging alternative using superior scanning technology (PET/CT or PET/MR) and enhanced quantitative assessment of disease in these NB patients. Imaging with 123I-MIBG is limited in several respects, including: a) inferior image quality related to the physical properties of the isotope that limit the dose of tracer that can be administered and the technology of the gamma camera and single photon imaging (SPECT), which has lower resolution than PET imaging; b) need for an imaging agent that not only targets lesions but also provides a superior high-contrast image to assess organs such as lung and liver; c) less optimal modality (SPECT imaging) due to limited ability to quantify uptake or measure metabolic activity of disease; and d) inconvenient two-day imaging process that requires injection on Day 1, followed by imaging on Day 2 to allow for optimal uptake of the tracer by the tumor and clearance of background activity [best target-to-background (T/BG) ratio]. An imaging modality that is more convenient and allows for superior quantification of disease is critically needed. PET imaging is superior to SPECT (higher resolution and ability to quantify lesion uptake and metabolic activity), and 18F-MFBG is a fluoride-labeled analog of MIBG with targeting properties similar to MIBG. The positron emitter 18F allows for imaging with a PET scanner and can provide high-contrast images with high T/BG ratios within one to three hours post-injection, a significantly more convenient option for patients than waiting 24 hours and returning to the clinic. The lesion uptake and distribution can be quantified with 18F-MFBG PET imaging. Additionally, imaging with 18F-MFBG will allow for combined PET/MR imaging, thereby reducing the radiation dose through the elimination of the CT component of PET/CT and its associated ionizing radiation. We hypothesize that PET imaging with 18F-MFBG will be safe and feasible and will target NB lesions comparable to or better than 123I-MIBG. Due to a convenient one-day imaging schema and PET imaging with PET/CT or PET/MR, this novel radiotracer is expected to play a critical role and replace 123I-MIBG for imaging of NB in the future. This is a Phase I/IIa study for early assessment of this novel imaging agent. Results of this study will be used to plan larger Phase II studies and, if successful, Phase III studies for validation of results and with the ultimate goal of achieving FDA approval."
"9411731","Project Summary The goal of the proposed research is to understand the immunologic mechanisms by which specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules provide resistance to develop autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) by evaluating insulin specific T cell responses, particularly focused on insulin B chain amino acids 9-23 (B:9-23). For many autoimmune disorders, including T1D, specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles confer disease risk as HLA-DQ8 and/or DQ2 are present in approximately 90% of all T1D patients. Strikingly, the polymorphic HLA-DQ6 (DQB*06:02) allele provides dominant protection from T1D. The objective of the proposed studies is to bridge the gap of knowledge regarding MHC class II disease resistance and self- antigen T cell response in T1D. Our long-term goal is to understand how insulin specific T cell responses can be manipulated for preventative and therapeutic purposes, ideally using mutated insulin B:9-23 as antigen specific therapy. The central hypothesis is that the MHC class II genotype shapes autoimmunity to insulin B:9- 23, determining susceptibility or protection from T1D. We plan to test our hypothesis using mutated insulin B:9- 23 peptides to determine T cell phenotypes in the context of MHC class II genotypes in murine and human diabetes. In specific aim 1, we will utilize a spontaneous mouse model of autoimmune diabetes including a model with a single amino acid mutation in the MHC class II beta chain (?57Ser?Asp) implicated in diabetes resistance. Insulin B:9-23 specific T cells restricted to risk and protective MHC class II molecules will be tracked using fluorescent tetramers. Experiments will be done to test the hypothesis that a protective MHC class II molecule leads to the generation of B:9-23 regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress islet autoimmunity; either through converting a pathogenic T cell to become regulatory and/or by differentiating B:9-23 specific Tregs restricted to the protective MHC class II molecule. In the second aim, we will study insulin and insulin B:9-23 specific T cell responses from well-characterized human subjects at risk for developing T1D and subjects without islet autoantibodies in a prospective longitudinal study. We now have the ability to measure both inflammatory and regulatory T cell responses to insulin with mutated B:9-23 peptides from the peripheral blood, which will allow for an increased understanding of disease pathogenesis in preclinical T1D. Further, healthy controls having the protective DQB*06:02 allele will be studied to isolate, characterize and T cell receptor (TCR) sequence B:9-23-specific Tregs, thereby creating reagents to assess the structural interactions of a diabetes resistant trimolecular complex, TCR-B:9-23-DQ6. A B:9-23/DQ6 tetramer will be produced to stain and phenotype ex vivo T cells from DQ6 individuals. The findings from this research are directly applicable to the design of insulin antigen specific therapies, monitoring and timing in the preclinical T1D period to prevent disease onset."
"9397336","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), one of the leading causes of death worldwide, results from adverse remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) of the heart after myocardial infarction (MI). To ameliorate LV remodeling, it has been shown that infarction modification through direct injection of biomaterials has the potential to limit infarct expansion. However, little effort has been directed toward determination of the optimal physical characteristics of the injectate, its interaction with infarcted myocardium, and the effect of patient-specific geometric patterns of injection. The ability of injected HA-based hydrogels to reduce infarct expansion and ameliorate adverse post- MI remodeling is dependent on HA hydrogel properties (elastic modulus, degradation rate, and distribution). The design of optimal materials and their deployment can be accomplished in-silico using organ-level models of the post-MI remodeling LV, thus allowing optimized materials to be developed with a limited need for animal and clinical experimentation. The proposed work employs a novel tunable hyaluronic acid (HA)-based injectable material and a clinically relevant ovine infarct model. State-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging methodologies, combined with experimentally determined 3D infarct material properties, serve as input for a finite element model for assessing LV geometry and microstructure of healthy, infarcted, and injected myocardium.

"9444934","7. Project Summary/Abstract Rodent models of organ transplantation may deviate from transplantation in the clinic both because there are species differences in basic properties of the immune system and because of extensive changes in the state of the immune system induced by encounters with microbes that do not occur in typical laboratory mice. Furthermore, the graft plays a major role in shaping the immune response and human tissue cells, especially endothelial cells (ECs), differ significantly in their immunological properties. As an important example, human CD4+ effector memory T cells are particularly effective at recognition of alloantigens displayed by human graft ECs, an interaction lacking in mice. Consequently, therapeutic strategies and reagents developed using mouse models often fail in the clinic. ?Humanized mice,? i.e. immunodeficient mice that are provided with a human immune system and then transplanted with human tissues, can address these issues and complement conventional mouse models. Humanized mice also allow testing of biologic therapeutics that often do not cross species. The principal limitation of humanized mice is that their human immune systems are incomplete, often lacking either functional T cells or functional myeloid accessory cells, cell types that must collaborate for an effective immune system. This proposal outlines an approach to improve an existing bioengineered humanized mouse model, known as MISTRG mice, that form a well differentiated myeloid compartment when inoculated as neonates with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, MISTRG mice lack well functioning T cell responses. We propose, to remedy this by combining HSC engraftment with adoptive transfer of mature naive and/or memory T cells from the same donor as the HSCs when the mice reach adulthood. We hypothesize and will test if our approach creates a more complete human immune response without causing graft-versus-host disease (specific aim 1) and then analyze the functions of engrafted myeloid cells both on different pathways of T cell recognition of alloantigen and on T cell-mediated rejection of human skin grafts, artery grafts or synthetic tissue grafts (specific aim 2). Successful completion of these aims will provide transplantation scientists and tissue engineers with a better model to develop and test new anti-rejection strategies that can be more readily transferred to humans."

HF is a major public health concern, and while survival has improved over the decades the absolute mortality rate for HF remains high at approximately 50% within 5 years of initial diagnosis. Numerous studies show that regular physical activity / exercise significantly improves exercise tolerance as well as clinical outcomes in HF. Exercise as a reliable adjunctive intervention, however, remains limited due to poor short- as well as long-term adherence. This proposed study will examine the effectiveness of the Heart Exercise And Resistance Training ? Peer Lead ActivitY (HEART?PLAY) intervention to significantly sustain exercise adherence in HF patients, as compared to a more standard exercise intervention. The HEART?PLAY intervention will be adapted from previous NHLBI-funded R01 work shown to have a sustained impact on moderate physical activity in the elderly. This proposed study will adapt the intervention to be safe for HF patients, deliver the intervention in cardiology clinics, and test adherence to the program over 18 months. Clinic staff and HF patients who are appropriate role models will be trained to teach the intervention activities with trained health educators. They will then be responsible for maintaining the program in the cardiology clinics. The HEART?PLAY program and behavior change will be sustainable because of the presence of peer and staff leadership and because it employs proven strategies from social cognitive theory and ecological models including self monitoring, social support, role modeling, and relapse prevention. In contrast to exercise classes that have a fixed schedule and limited evidence for adherence, HEART-PLAY teaches patients how to accumulate meaningful physical activity across the day and provides a supportive social infrastructure to maintain motivation. In a rigorous cluster randomized controlled trial at cardiology clinics at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) hospitals and at the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS), we will develop and assess the HEART?PLAY intervention program in 264 socioeconomically and ethnically diverse women and men 60+ years old with either HF with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) or HF with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF). Participants in the HEART?PLAY and in the STANDARD exercise programs will receive self-monitoring tools for aerobic plus resistance training as well as group education and materials. Participants in HEART?PLAY will additionally receive peer and staff leadership. We will demonstrate that the peer-led HEART?PLAY program based in the clinic setting will significantly enhance the primary study endpoint of adherence to 150 min/week of moderate physical activity/week over an 18-month follow up. We envision the study?s findings will provide a successful intervention model that will be exportable to the clinic environment.!"
"9443718","ABSTRACT The goal of this study is to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying dynamic genome-wide gene expression during spermatogenesis. The gene expression program of germ cells is distinct from that of somatic lineages. Importantly, the somatic gene expression program is largely suppressed in male germ cells. Instead, male germ cells retain a unique cellular identity that is passed on to sperm and gives rise to a totipotent zygote after fertilization. Our recent RNA-seq analysis showed that about three thousand spermatogenesis-specific genes are activated, while approximately three thousand genes expressed in both somatic lineages and progenitor cells of the male germline (termed somatic/progenitor genes) are largely suppressed during late spermatogenesis, i.e., in meiosis and in postmeiotic spermatids. We identified SCML2 as the suppressor of somatic/progenitor genes. SCML2 is a germline-specific subunit of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), a regulator of heritable gene repression during development. We have discovered that Polycomb complexes determine the gene expression profile by programming genes for both repression and activation. Our combined results suggest that the epigenome of undifferentiated spermatogonia is preset (termed ?preprogrammed?) both for subsequent genome-wide gene silencing and activation during spermatogenesis (termed ?programmed differentiation?). What remain unknown are the mechanisms whereby Polycomb proteins regulate gene expression during spermatogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that Polycomb proteins cooperate to preprogram the epigenome in undifferentiated spermatogonia, thus regulating the subsequent dynamic genome-wide expression profile and programmed differentiation necessary for spermatogenesis. This study will address how the epigenome of undifferentiated spermatogonia is prepared to respond to differentiation cues and, afterwards, how the differentiation program is maintained through mitotic and meiotic divisions. We have designed two complementary specific aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate how PRC1 defines heritable gene activation and silencing during spermatogenesis. In Aim 2, we will address how SCML2 preprograms the epigenome for later spermatogenic differentiation. These studies will reveal novel epigenetic mechanisms by which interplay between Polycomb proteins regulates the dynamic gene expression during spermatogenesis."
"9445943","In our current IPCAVD program (U19 AI096040), we have developed alternative serotype adenovirus vectors, bioinformatically optimized HIV-1 mosaic antigens, and stable Env gp140 protein immunogens. We have shown that the Ad26-Env/Gag/Pol prime, Env gp140 protein boost (Ad26/Env) vaccine afforded unprecedented protective efficacy against acquisition of infection following heterologous SIVmac251 challenges in rhesus monkeys, as well as robust protection against SHIV-SF162P3 challenges. Protection correlated with polyfunctional antibody responses as determined by systems serology. We have also advanced the Ad26/Env, Ad26/MVA, and Ad26/MVA/Env mosaic vaccines into phase 1/2a clinical trials in the United States, East Africa, South Africa, and Thailand. Over the next 5 years of this IPCAVD program, we propose to define the extent and mechanism of protection achieved by our lead Ad26/Env vaccine regimen in rhesus monkeys, to advance our lead vaccine regimen into phase 2b/3 efficacy studies in humans, and to develop an improved next generation HIV-1 vaccine candidate. In this Project, we hypothesize that our current Ad26/Env mosaic vaccine as well as simplified vaccine regimens will protect against SHIVs derived from diverse clades by a consistent mechanism involving polyfunctional non-neutralizing antibodies. We further hypothesize that a next generation HIV-1 vaccine candidate that elicits augmented NAb magnitude and breadth will improve protective efficacy against SHIV challenges in rhesus monkeys. To test these hypotheses we propose the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the protective efficacy and protective mechanism of our Ad26/Env mosaic vaccine and simplified vaccine regimens against SHIVs derived from diverse clades in rhesus monkeys Specific Aim 2. To develop an improved HIV-1 vaccine strategy that elicits augmented NAb responses in rhesus monkeys"
"9470702","PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus? Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. !"
"9476153","PROPOSAL SUMMARY Perturbations in the development of the cerebral cortex underlie a wide array of common neurogenic syndromes, ranging from dyslexia to cerebral palsy. The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate mechanisms by which improper formation of the cortex occurs, and ultimately discover novel targets to treat patients. Here we use next-generation sequencing to isolate genes involved in cortical malformations complemented with an in vitro model in which we can experimentally determine pathways leading to aberrant phenotypes. For this, we will use human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to recapitulate the development of human cerebral cortex in vitro. Importantly, in this in vitro cerebral model we will study neuronal activity, a key biomarker and essential contributor to neural circuit development. Further, using hiPSCs derived from individuals with cortical malformations, we can study aberrant neurodevelopmental features along a range of time points during embryonic development. Wide-field fluorescence imaging will enable the analysis of large populations of neurons, which can be probed in real-time with targeted pharmacological agents and stimulation paradigms. The proposed work will have immediate health benefits; the discovery of genes involved in disease can be promptly used to screen children with undiagnosed disorders. Additionally, using neuronal activity as a biomarker, we plan to develop this novel tool for isolating new mechanisms of cortical malformation."
"9473519","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite decades of research current treatments remain only partially effective, or in the case of ablation, invasive, costly and not effective in some patients. Development of novel, effective and safe therapy for AF has been hampered by the lack of animal models that reflect AF in humans. While some large animal models exhibit aspects of human AF it is difficult to test and develop novel small molecule therapies for AF in these costly and limited models. Ideally, a small animal model that faithfully phenocopies human AF would be an invaluable tool for both understanding the molecular physiology of AF and potentially for identifying and testing novel small molecule therapeutics. Indeed, murine models have proved invaluable in the development of novel therapeutics for cancer, diabetes and obesity. The lack of a mouse model for AF is a barrier to research in this important disease. To address this gap we created doxycycline-inducible transgenic (TG) mice with a mutation (F1759A) of the local anesthetic binding site in human SCN5A, the cardiac NaV1.5 channel gene. Fortuitously these mice exhibit modest atrial enlargement and fibrosis, mitochondrial dysmorphology, frequent, sustained episodes of spontaneous AF, and non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, observed as early as 5 weeks of age in the absence of doxycycline. The sustained and spontaneous atrial arrhythmias, an unusual if not unique phenotype in mice, enabled initial explorations of mechanisms of AF using in vivo (telemetry), ex vivo (optical voltage mapping), and in vitro (cellular electrophysiology) techniques. We now propose to use this mouse model to more fully characterize the molecular mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis, to explore whether altered Ca2+ homeostasis contributes to the genesis and maintenance of AF, and whether targeting altered Ca2+ homeostasis could be an effective treatment of AF. Three Aims are proposed: Aim 1: To examine the downstream mechanisms by which increased cytosolic Ca2+ increases the propensity of AF. We will test using genetic and pharmacological approaches whether inhibitors of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and Ca2+-calmodulin dependent kinase (CaMKII) can inhibit AF in vivo and and spiral waves/rotors ex vivo. Aim 2: To test the causal link between increased persistent Na+ current, ?leaky? RyR2, and the susceptibility for AF. We will use pharmacological and genetic approaches to inhibit RyR2 leak to see whether it plays a role in AF and whether it may be a novel therapeutic target. Aim 3: To test the causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction due to increased persistent Na+ current and leaky RyR2 channels, and the susceptibility for AF. The proposed studies may identify important links between dysfunctional Na+ channels, abnormal SR Ca2+ release in AF, defective Ca2+-dependent signaling in AF, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative overload in AF. Our studies are designed to provide rigorous and robust hypothesis-testing to open new understandings of the molecular bases of AF and to pave the way towards novel, mechanism-based, effective and safe treatments."
"9603977","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many mental disorders can only be understood as an interaction between brain development and susceptibility to risk factors. While the characterization of the latter has increased in recent years, less is known on how risk factors alter the normal trajectory of maturation in brain circuits, especially during adolescence when the onset of many psychiatric disorders occurs including schizophrenia. Thus, our long-term goal is to identify neurodevelopmental processes underlying the adolescent vulnerability for the onset of psychiatric disorders where the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is compromised, focusing on the impact of external risk factors on the functional maturation of GABAergic inhibitory circuits therein. One such risk factor is the use of cannabis during adolescence, which has been causally linked to increased risk of developing schizophrenia and PFC-dependent cognitive symptoms later in life. The objective of this application is to identify how adolescent exposure to cannabinoids alters the normative development of the PFC GABAergic transmission and determine how these changes could elicit long-lasting impairments in PFC function. Given that GABAergic interneurons in the PFC are undergoing vast developmental changes during adolescence, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the adolescent PFC GABAergic system is highly vulnerable to the effects of exogenous cannabinoids through a CB1R-dependent mechanism, and that this untimely exposure leads to an impaired and disinhibited PFC network function that endures to adulthood. This hypothesis will be tested through the following Specific Aims: (1) identify the cellular mechanisms underlying the enduring disruption of PFC GABAergic function resulting from repeated cannabinoid exposure during adolescence; (2) determine the impact of repeated cannabinoid exposure on the maturation of PFC network synchrony; (3) determine whether repeated cannabinoid exposure during adolescence results in enduring PFC-dependent behavioral deficits in adulthood. The proposed plan is innovative in our opinion because it will identify for the first time the cellular mechanisms underlying the age-dependent susceptibility of PFC GABAergic circuits to cannabinoid exposure, with special emphasis on parvalbumin/fast-spiking interneurons as the target of exogenous cannabinoids through a CB1R-dependent presynaptic inhibition of interneuronal activity. All in all, the proposed research is significant because it wll uncover for the first time key neurodevelopmental mechanisms that contribute to the age-dependent, long-lasting detrimental effects of cannabinoid use during adolescence. This knowledge is expected to have a positive impact in prevention and intervention strategies for those afflicted by cognitive impairments caused by early cannabis consumption, and importantly, it will guide the public policy regarding the regulation of cannabis use in adolescent and adults."
"9413917","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Periodontitis affects 64 million US adults, leading to bone and tooth loss and contributing to systemic conditions. Subgingival bacteria play a major role in periodontitis. Because 50% of the oral microbiome is unrecognized or uncultured, important species may have been overlooked, representing a gap in knowledge.  The progress in cultivating relevant oral uncultured taxa has been slow. The few studies available are either low-throughput or open-ended, which are less suitable to cultivate putative pathogens. Because our goal is to improve periodontal health, we aim at cultivating taxa that are relevant in disease, and not just any uncultured taxa. Results from my R03 showed that many unrecognized/uncultured subgingival taxa were uncommon, thus unlikely to be relevant. In contrast, I identified 30 abundant uncultured taxa that merit further pursuit and will be the focus of this proposal. Our long term goal is to identify new periodontal pathogens and their pathogenic mechanisms. The overall objective of this proposal is to recover and domesticate uncultured taxa associated with periodontal disease. Our central hypothesis is that their growth results from interactions with community members and the habitat, which have not yet been reproduced in vitro. Our rationale is that targeted systematic cultivation of relevant taxa in ex vivo biofilms is a cost-effective approach to isolate new periodontal pathogens. We will use technological and conceptual innovative approaches to achieve our goals.  We will test this hypothesis and accomplish our objective by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) Support the growth of prominent uncultured taxa in ex vivo periodontal biofilms: we will use the Calgary Biofilm Device to multiplex the cultivation conditions (using multiple growth conditions in paralle) of subgingival samples pre-screened for the target taxa using 16S rRNA lllumina sequencing; 2) Identify helper species that can sustain the growth of target uncultured periodontal taxa: we will use CLASI-FISH (a multiplex FISH) on the biofilms and correlation network analysis of 16S rRNA data to identify in situ and in silico the best helper species based on their co-occurrence and physical proximity with target uncultured taxa; and 3) Domesticate uncultured periodontal taxa in a small consortium of helper species: we will use the best growth conditions and helpers species identified above for the high-throughput parallel co-cultivation of uncultured taxa.  This proposal is significant because it will allow the cultivation of novel putative periodontal pathogens, a key step to determine their pathogenicity. Our contribution to the field will be the identification of ecological relationships that allow their growth, the generation of whole genomic sequences as well as the development of a systematic approach that can be useful to study other biofilm diseases. The outcomes of our study will support NIDCR's research initiatives for FY2014 (the role of uncultivable bacteria in the oral microbiome) and their mission to foster the knowledge of the etiology and pathogenesis of oral infectious diseases."
"9421098","Heart failure (HF) is a devastating disease. Debilitation, mortality, and concomitant economic burden associated with HF all point to the need for new therapies to address this problem more effectively. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) in periphery and the central nervous system, particularly tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), have been implicated in the pathophysiology of HF. However, anti-TNF clinical trials targeting peripheral manifestations of HF have failed to exhibit beneficial significance, indicating that the mechanisms of TNF-? have not been challenged. Our previous study discovered that TNF-? increases in cardiovascular/autonomic-related regions of the brain in a rat model of HF and contribute significantly to sympathetic excitation in that setting. More recently, our preliminary data indicated that TACE, a TNF-? converting enzyme, is upregulated in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of hypothalamus and subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain, and can alter cardiovascular function and sympathetic drive in HF rats. Unlike other cytokines, TNF-? is initially produced as a transmembrane protein (tmTNF-?). TACE is responsible for the cleavage of tmTNF-? to release its mature form, the soluble TNF-? (sTNF-?), to mediate inflammatory and immune responses. Further evidence indicated that sTNF-? binds predominantly to the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) to elicit pro-inflammatory and toxic responses and that tmTNF-? binds preferentially to the TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) to display an anti-inflammatory and protective role. This project will underline the role of the brain TACE in TNF-??induced inflammatory mechanisms driving the neurohumoral activation in HF. Using a multifaceted approach including electrophysiology, molecular biology, immunocytochemistry, pharmacology, and biochemistry in sham-operated and HF rats, this project will determine 1) whether TACE regulates the balance between sTNF-? and tmTNF-? in SFO and PVN in HF, and what cell types are involved; 2) whether increased TACE activity and/or decreased TNFR2 expression in brain contribute to the neurohumoral excitation in HF; 3) whether inhibition of TACE or activation of TNFR2 in the brain has a beneficial effect on cardiac function and survival rate in HF. These studies will characterize a previously unrecognized role of brain TACE in neurohumoral activation in HF and will identify a novel anti-TNF target for pharmacological intervention of HF. Completion of this research project will provide important insights into the anti-cytokine therapeutic strategy in HF and may also have implications in other cardiovascular disorders like hypertension and metabolic diseases like obesity or diabetes."
"9405040","The LDL-receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) is a highly efficient endocytic and a signal transducing receptor that plays an important role in vascular development. By developing a mouse in which LRP1 was genetically deleted in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), we have also discovered that LRP1 protects the vasculature from the development of aneurysms. Currently, mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood, but our studies thus far reveal that LRP1 regulates matrix assembly, TGF? signaling, and levels of protease activity in the vessel wall. Defining the molecular mechanism by which LRP1 regulates these events is one goal of this Outstanding Investigator Award. The significance of these studies are enhanced by the identification of patients with aneurysmal disease harboring missense mutations in LRP1. Biochemical characterization of the functional defects imposed by these mutant receptors will be critical to define the mechanisms by which LRP1 regulates vessel wall homeostasis, and represents another major goal of our studies. This will be accomplished by a the generation of mutant LRP1 substituted mice employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system. LRP1 interacts with over 40 ligands with high affinity, and despite substantial effort, very little information is available regarding the nature of the receptor/ligand complex. We also propose strategies to solve this problem using the latest technological advances in structural biology. Closely related in structure to LRP1 is LRP1B, another receptor that is abundant in SMC and regulates their migration and proliferation by unknown mechanisms. We propose genetic, proteomic and RNA-seq analysis to identify mechanisms by which this receptor regulates SMC growth. Together, the studies will define the mechanisms by which LDL receptor family members protect the vasculature from disease and may identify novel therapeutic approaches for patients harboring LRP1 missense mutations."
"9445944","We are developing a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine that aims to protect against all clades of HIV-1 through heterologous prime/boost regimens using adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vectors expressing unique mosaic Gag, Pol, and Env antigens with soluble trimeric Env gp140 proteins to enhance humoral immunity. In December 2014, the program entered into its Phase 1/2a clinical phase assessing the safety and immunogenicity of Clade C gp140, trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV vectors, and MVA.Mos.HIV vectors. Additional Phase 1/2a clinical studies started in 2016 and early 2017 are testing a tetravalent Ad26.Mos4.HIV and the addition of a Mosaic gp140 protein to the Clade C gp140 component. In an effort to explore simplification of the vaccine components, we propose to conduct additional ancillary clinical studies. Priority will be given to combinations evaluated in Project 1, including simplified vaccine composition. To secure availability of clinical trial materials, we propose GMP manufacturing activities that cover fill and finish, release assays, and characterization and stability testing of drug products. Finally, in order to support late stage development and characterization of selected vaccine candidates, we propose to perform bridging preclinical studies. In this Project, we hypothesize that our lead Ad26/Env vaccine will protect humans against multiple strains of HIV-1. Moreover, we hypothesize that simplified and shortened regimens will prove comparably immunogenic. To test these hypotheses we propose the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To progress with the clinical evaluation of the lead candidate vaccines from Phase 1/2a to Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials while in parallel exploring shorter and/or simplified regimens Specific Aim 2. To manufacture, release and characterize clinical vaccine products and to support CMC development with preclinical bridging studies"
"9402642","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First-time donors provide 31% of all blood donations. Unfortunately, the majority of young and first-time donors do not return for a repeat donation, and only 2% of first-time donors under the age of 20 go on to become committed blood donors. Hence our blood supply is highly reliant on young donors who must constantly be replaced. In addition to enormous ongoing recruitment costs, failure to retain first-time donors has important health implications, as repeat blood donors are less likely to be deferred for poor health and to transmit infections such as HIV and hepatitis. Accordingly, for health, safety, and economic reasons there is a critical need for novel approaches to enhance the retention of new blood donors. The current application examines an innovative, theory-driven approach to retention by promoting intrinsic motivation to donate again among new blood donors. Self-determination theory (SDT) proposes that people are more likely to persist with behaviors that are internally versus externally motivated, and considerable research supports the notion that more internalized motivation is associated with better adherence in a variety of health contexts. Similar findings have also been reported in the blood donation context where measures of the extent to which a donor identity has been internalized are positively related to both donation intention and future donation behavior. Based on our prior work, we propose to test a multi-component intervention designed to enhance one, two, or all three of the fundamental human needs that contribute to internal motivation according to SDT (i.e., competence, autonomy, relatedness). Using a full factorial design, first-time donors will be randomly assigned to a control condition or an intervention that addresses one, two, or all three of the fundamental needs. Our primary outcome measure will be donation attempts in the one-year follow-up period. Additional outcome measures will include changes in donation competence, autonomy, and relatedness as well as key constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, intention). Our primary aim is to determine whether the intervention conditions, alone and in combination, increase the likelihood of a donation attempt in the next year. Our second aim is to examine intervention-specific increases in competence, autonomy, and relatedness as potential mediators of enhanced donor retention. Finally, an exploratory aim will examine an integrative model of motivation that views autonomy as a mediating influence on the more proximal, situational-level determinants of behavior (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention). This project is significan, innovative, and timely as it develops a much-needed, new approach to first-time donor retention while examining specific, theory-driven intervention mechanisms that have never been tested in the donation context. This study will have an important public health impact by developing efficient interventions that can be widely disseminated to promote a safe and stable national blood supply."
"9455009","01. PROJECT SUMMARY Influenza infection leads to different clinical outcomes that range from benign symptoms to hospitalization and sometimes death (ranging from 12,000 to 56,000 deaths per year in the United States). However, biomarkers predictive of influenza disease outcomes (i.e. symptoms severity, viral replication) which are key for preventive medicine have not yet been identified. Moreover, elucidation of the molecular components that govern predictive signatures will provide important clues that will guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This U19 will build on a wealth of data gathered already by the previous FluOMICS consortium and pursue two converging hypotheses 1) multiple and discrete host immune response pathways act in concert to determine the pathogenic outcome of influenza infection 2) the crosstalk between influenza and these host pathways results in the establishment of correlated epigenetic, transcriptional, post-translational, metabolic signatures in multiple tissues and cell types. The major objective of the Modeling Core will be to use network-based modeling approaches to integrate the experimental data generated by Project 1 and Project 2, identify biological processes that can predict influenza disease outcomes and validate them functionally in collaboration with Project 1 and Project 2. In Aim 1 the Modeling Core, in collaboration with the Technology Core and the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core, will preprocess, apply the appropriate statistical analysis and interpret all large-scale (OMIC) datasets generated in Project 1 and Project 2. We will provide data integration and visual representation for each OMIC dataset and summary tables giving the number and identity of differentially expressed markers (genes/proteins/post-translational modifications/metabolites) associated with disease outcomes. In Aim 2, the Modeling Core will provide an integrated view of all these datasets by mapping them to networks of transcriptional nodes and signal transduction pathways which are differentially triggered by different conditions of infection and mimic differences between hosts. Critically, the Modeling Core will apply heuristic approaches and an iterative process with the Project 1 and Project 2 to unravel and improve on correlations between networks of biological pathways collected in orthogonal sample types (i.e. human/mouse blood, mouse lungs, and human cells) generated by the cores. In Aim 3 the Modeling Core will use a machine learning technique to generate predictive models based on prioritized set of markers able to predict responses to influenza strains linked to various disease states. These markers will include host factors and host-pathogen interactions that predict clinical outcomes and may be mechanistically implicated in symptoms severity. The Modeling Core will stand in this U19 as the ultimate infrastructure and resource that will integrate the large body of data generated in this program and provide to the scientific community important deliverables namely validated signatures of disease severity, biomarkers for preventive medicine and mechanistic cues to the diversity of clinical outcomes.!"
"9469664","Twenty million new sexually transmitted infections (STIs) occur each year in the U.S. These infections can lead to chronic pelvic pain, stigma, as well as ectopic pregnancy and infertility. One underexplored approach for the prevention of STIs in women is harnessing the protective features of the vaginal microbiome. Abundant Lactobacillus spp. in the human vagina are thought to protect against invasion by non-indigenous bacteria, including Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). Mechanisms underlying this protection are not well understood. Vaginal Lactobacillus spp. provide broad- spectrum antimicrobial activity in part through their production of lactic acid, which creates an acidic and hostile environment to pathogens. To date, studies have relied on bacterial cultivation techniques or microscopic evaluation to describe the association between vaginal bacteria and STI risk. The goal of this project is to identify genomic features of the vaginal microbiome and host immunological biomarkers that are associated with increased protection from incident STIs. It is hypothesized that not all Lactobacillus species or strains have the same potential to reduce the risk for STIs. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal (CVL) samples from the nested case-control Longitudinal Study of the Vaginal Microbiome Prior to Incident STI (R01-AI116799, PI: Brotman) to assess the microbial profiles of 397 women observed to acquire an incident CT, GC, or TV genital infection compared to 397 age and race matched controls. This training grant will focus on conducting metagenomic analyses of CVL samples to find genomic signatures of susceptibility to, and protection from, incident STI. The host mucosal immune response will be measured through cytokine profiling. Specific aims of this proposal are to (1) conduct a metagenomic analysis of the CVL samples to determine associations of vaginal microbial functional genes and gene pathways with incident STI risk, (2) conduct genome reconstruction analyses to characterize genomic strains of Lactobacillus spp. from vaginal metagenomes and determine their associations with STI case status, and (3) assess the interactions between human pro-inflammatory responses and the vaginal microbiome in risk for incident STI. Strain diversity may be an important modulator of the host immune response as well as host susceptibility to infection. Preliminary data for Lactobacillus iners strains show major genomic diversity between women, but strain and health outcome relationships remains to be determined. The proposed high-resolution metagenomic analyses will produce unprecedented insights into how the vaginal microbiome confers protection against acquisition of STIs and the roles of the associated host immune response. Host and microbial targets identified through these aims can be exploited in the future for the development of translational curative or prophylactic interventions that would directly affect women?s reproductive health. This fellowship will provide the applicant new training in comparative genomics and molecular epidemiology."
"9414443","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) telomere maintenance mechanism is an area of active research, particularly in non-epithelial cancers where ALT is commonly found (e.g. gliomas, sarcomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors). For many of these cancers the prognosis is poor and therapeutic options are limited. Encouraging results from a recent pre-clinical study show a pharmacological inhibitor of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) protein, ATR, exhibits selective toxicity against osteosarcoma and glioblastoma cancer cells that utilize the ALT pathway for telomere maintenance, instead of up-regulating the enzyme, telomerase. Less appreciated and under- investigated are adenocarcinomas that employ the ALT pathway. We hypothesize that ALT-positive adenocarcinomas share molecular features with ALT-positive cancers of non-epithelial origin, and that these similarities will result in a comparable sensitivity to ATR inhibition.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to study ALT in adenocarcinomas, using prostate cancer cell lines as an initial in vitro model system, to investigate whether similar strategies of pharmacologically inhibiting DDR proteins, such as ATR, in ALT-positive adenocarcinomas will also show efficacy. In Aim 1, we will generate and validate the first adenocarcinoma cell lines that employ ALT. Our laboratory previously discovered a strong correlation between ALT-positive tumors and somatic inactivating mutations in either the ATRX and DAXX genes. To date, no prostate cancer cell line has been identified that displays the ALT phenotype. Using the CRISPR cas9 genome editing technique, we will create isogenic prostate cancer cell lines with inactivating mutations in ATRX or DAXX genes. In Aim 2, we will characterize the molecular features underlying the ALT process in prostate cancer cells by comparing the telomerase-positive/ALT-negative parental lines for differences in the relative expression of telomerase components, telomerase activity, nuclear architecture, and activity levels of homology-directed recombination, which is thought to be crucial to the ALT pathway. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the response of ALT-positive prostate cancer cells to DDR inhibition. Preliminary evidence shows a dramatically activated DDR in ALT-positive cells, suggesting that an increase in the level of DNA damage or a reduction in repair capacity in these already stressed cells may be sufficient to induce apoptosis. DDR proteins will be inhibited using RNA interference strategies, as well as existing pharmacological inhibitors in ALT-positive prostate cancer cell lines. The research findings of the proposed study will have real biological and therapeutic value by increasing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ALT in adenocarcinomas, and by determining if this unique molecular subset of carcinomas is susceptible to enhanced killing by inhibiting DDR proteins."

Molecularly distinct cell types in a complex tissue can now be comprehensively identified and studied using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) technologies. In preliminary studies, we found that the scRNAseq approach known as Drop-seq can be used to identify the principle cell types of the mouse spinal cord, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells. In this proposal, we hypothesize that single cell sequencing can be used to comprehensively identify cellular and molecular changes that take place in the spinal cord following peripheral nerve injury. To accomplish this, we will complete the following aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that Drop-seq can identify changes in spinal cell populations in a mouse neuropathic pain model, which features prolonged (>21 d) mechanical allodynia?a core behavioral phenotype of neuropathic pain. (2) Test the hypothesis that scRNAseq at varying timepoints can identify cell-specific transitions from acute to chronic pain. Our research will provide the first comprehensive understanding of how spinal cell types, and the neural circuits they make up, change in response to nerve injury?an insult that produces stable behavioral changes indicative of neuropathic pain."
"9423719","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Coronary artery disease (CAD) from calcific atherosclerosis is the single leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The calcium composition of atherosclerotic plaque has predictive value in terms of cardiovascular events. Inflammation is likely a key mediator of vascular calcification, but immune signaling mechanisms that promote this process are minimally understood. Recently, the small GTPase, Rac2, was identified as a major inflammatory regulator of signaling that directs plaque osteogenesis. Atherosclerotic aortas from ApoE-/- mice fed a high fat diet supplemented with cholesterol demonstrated dynamic expression of Rac2 mRNA expression over time. Moreover, decreased Rac2 expression correlated with increased atherosclerotic calcification, both in the experimental animal model and in human coronary artery plaques. Rac2 -/-ApoE -/- mice helped to define a protective role of Rac2, which prevented progressive calcification through its suppression of Rac1-dependent macrophage IL-1? expression. Plaque and serum from mice with calcified plaque demonstrated increased expression of IL-1?, and moreover, treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist inhibited the enhanced atherosclerotic calcification. IL-1? expression was a key driver of vascular smooth muscle cell calcium deposition by its ability to promote osteogenic transcriptional programs, including expression of the osteogenic transcription factors, RUNX2, SOX9, OSX and MSX2. Bone marrow transplantation confirmed the progressive calcification of plaque attributable to Rac2 gene deletion was dependent on the hematopoietic compartment. Several key questions remain: 1) what is the role of macrophage Rac1 in plaque development and atherosclerotic calcification in standard experimental models; 2) are macrophages the key cellular source of plaque IL-1?; 3) how does Rac2 suppress Rac1-dependent macrophage IL-1? expression; and 4) are these signaling mechanisms relevant to calcified atherosclerotic plaque from patients with coronary artery disease? The overall objective of the proposed studies is to thoroughly answer these questions. Preliminary data demonstrate that Rac1 can be a key promoter of macrophage IL-1? expression and that Rac2 and Rac1 may antagonize each other through competition for a similar guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Tiam1, which is upregulated under conditions that activate IL-1? expression. The hypothesis is that macrophage Rac signaling determines atherosclerotic plaque IL-1? expression and consequent inflammatory atherosclerotic calcification, and thus disrupting this pathway can be an effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of CAD. Aim1 will define the role of macrophage Rac1 in plaque IL-1? expression and atherosclerotic calcification. Aim2 will confirm that Rac1 and Rac2 compete for Tiam1, a critical Rac-GEf that is upregulated during macrophage inflammatory activation as well as during experimental atherosclerosis, and that IL-1? expression and inflammatory atherosclerotic calcification are dependent on Tiam1 expression. Finally, Aim3 will confirm the validity of these macrophage signaling mechanisms in atherosclerotic plaque samples from patients with known coronary artery disease. Confirming that a macrophage Rac-IL-1? signaling axis is a central mechanism in inflammatory atherosclerotic calcification paves the way for developing a novel therapeutic strategy for treating coronary artery disease, as small molecular inhibitors of Rac1 and Rac1-Tiam1 interactions have been developed and are incorporated into a number of the proposed studies."
"9545908","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A pressing need exists for clinically applicable systems for ex vivo platelet production. Multiple technological advances have set the stage to attain this goal. Inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from donor somatic cells can now be manipulated to yield customized, expandable megakaryocyte (Mk) progenitors. Perfusion bioreactors that replicate the bone marrow environment have enhanced the efficiency of functional platelet release and collection. The biggest roadblock in clinical translation consiss of the problem of scalability. In particular, highly proliferative Mk progenitors yield poor platelt numbers, and Mk with high platelet yields come from progenitors with very limited prolferative capacity. An ability to circumvent these limitations by combining progenitor expandability with efficient platelet production will be critical for cost- effective scale-up. The efficiency of platlet production depends on a program of Mk morphogenesis involving massive cellular enlargement and polyploidization. The relative balance of morphogenetic versus proliferative potential depends on ontogenic developmental stage. Thus, fetal and neonatal Mk progenitors show extensive self-renewal but limited morphogenesis. Progenitors derived from human ESC and iPSC recapitulate the features of early fetal megakaryopoiesis: high proliferation with minimal morphogenesis. The influence of ontogenic stage affects not only platelet numbers but also extends to platelet function. Specifically, Mk from earlier in ontogeny yield platelets with proportionally diminished aggregation capacity.  Our lab identified a signaling pathway critical in Mk morphogenesis (Elagib et al. Dev. Cell, 2013). In this pathway, high-amplitude activation of the transcriptional kinase P-TEFb occurs due to downregulation of the noncoding RNA 7SK. In new unpublished data, we find that defects in this Mk morphogenesis pathway underlie the phenotypic differences between neonatal and adult Mk. Specifically, neonatal Mk fail to downregulate 7SK and fail to trigger high-amplitude activation of P-TEFb. We have identified a 7SK binding factor, IGF2BP3, that is present only in neonatal Mk and functions as an ontogenic masterswitch in Mk morphogenesis. Antagonism of IGF2BP3 by either shRNA knockdown or a novel inhibitory compound significantly augments morphogenesis in neonatal Mk. Conversely, ectopic IGF2BP3 converts adult MK into a fetal phenotype, and a putative agonist compound augments fetal-like features in neonatal Mk. IGF2BP3 thus represents a highly attractive target for engineering scalable megakaryopoiesis. In human neonatal Mk, it appears to be the key determinant of Mk ontogenic phenotype. From a therapeutic perspective, it is a druggable target, with the capability of both negative and positive modulation. Aim 1 will examine the morphogenesis signaling pathway in iPSC Mk, the contributions of IGF2BP factors, and optimal approaches to enhance thrombopoiesis. Aim 2 will take a complementary approach and determine circuits necessary for fetal reprogramming of adult Mk progenitors, thereby allowing for their large-scale, reversible expansion."

"9390802","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates."
"9464710","PROJECT SUMMARY Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a heterogeneous disease encompassing a broad range of heart and vasculature disorders and is the number one cause of death worldwide. A well-established relationship exists between quantitative variation in the plasma lipid levels and CVD risk; however, the exact mechanism is unclear. Lipids play a crucial role in cell, tissue and organ physiology, and their metabolism is tightly regulated; however, in many human diseases lipid metabolism is disrupted. The classical lipid parameters (HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides) most commonly examined in relation to disease risk are themselves complex entities composed of multiple lipid species. We hypothesize that these basic lipid species represent unique phenotypes that are better predictors of disease risk and may lead to the more rapid discovery of genes causally involved in lipid variation and cardiovascular disease. In this project we will exploit whole genome sequence (WGS) information using a mixed longitudinal design in powerful extended pedigrees of Mexican American individuals in combination with comprehensive measures of the human lipidome, to identify novel genes and functional variants influencing lipid variation and risk of CVD development. This project will generate novel lipid endophenotypes that may represent better predictors of disease risk. The combination of these precise biological phenotypes and WGS gives us an unprecedented opportunity to identify novel genes and functional variants influencing human lipid variation and risk of CVD. To achieve these objectives, we will (I) perform untargeted lipid profiling in 500 Mexican American individuals from seven large SAFS pedigrees, identify those species genetically correlated with CVD-related traits and incorporate these into a targeted assay to profile in all individuals; (II) perform targeted lipid profiling in 2,500 Mexican American individuals followed by quantitative genetic analyses; (III) identify novel sequence variation influencing lipid variation and CVD risk in all individuals using WGS; (IV) perform replication in an independent Mexican American population, the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort. CVD is the leading cause of death globally, posing a huge economic burden. The ability to identify genes that are causally involved in disease risk provides an unparalleled opportunity to quickly determine biological pathways that are involved in disease pathology. A better understanding of the genetic contribution to lipid variation and CVD development will provide novel approaches for the characterization, treatment and potential prevention of this costly disease."
"9412142","Project Summary Bladder nociceptive afferents play an important role in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC). Although extensive research has been conducted to understand the involvement of parasympathetic pelvic C- fiber afferents in bladder nociception, very few studies have investigated the role of sympathetic hypogastric afferents. Previous animal studies have shown that sympathetic hypogastric afferents respond to bladder distension and/or irritation. Clinical evidence also supports the role of sympathetic afferents in bladder sensation/pain because blockade of the sympathetic afferent pathway can significantly relieve visceral pelvic pain including PBS/IC symptoms and bladder sensation/pain can still be elicited in human subjects with destroyed sacral spinal cord or transected sacral spinal roots. Since both sympathetic hypogastric nerves and parasympathetic pelvic nerves innervate the bladder, bladder distention/irritation always activates both pathways, causing significant difficulty in separating the functions of these two pathways in bladder nociception. Currently it is still unknown how sympathetic hypogastric afferents interact with the parasympathetic pelvic afferents in the CNS to modulate bladder function. It is also unknown if sympathetic hypogastric afferents alone can trigger bladder reflex activity and what role the sympathetic hypogastric nociceptive afferents play in bladder nociception/overactivity. Without this basic knowledge, our understanding of bladder nociception is certainly incomplete, which is evident clinically when diagnosing and attempting to treat PBS/IC. Therefore, in this grant application we propose to determine the functions of both parasympathetic nociceptive pelvic C-fiber afferents and sympathetic nociceptive/non-nociceptive hypogastric afferents in the control of bladder reflex activity and to determine the central convergence/interaction between sympathetic hypogastric afferents and parasympathetic pelvic nociceptive/non-nociceptive afferents. The success of our project will provide the basic scientific knowledge of bladder nociception and will benefit millions of Americans suffering from PBS/IC."
"9624872","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ?15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice."
"9455845","Summary A new generation of bioabsorbable metal stents is currently being developed to be fully absorbed after completing their task as vascular scaffolding. A breakthrough in the field was made in 2012 in our research team with the introduction of zinc (Zn) and its alloys. A big surprise of our earlier exploratory work has motivated us to explore the effect of zinc degradation on the formation of intimal hyperplasia. We discovered a gradient of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within the stable neointima surrounding the zinc implants out to 6 months. A thin band of SMCs was present along the outer perimeter of the neointima, with no SMCs closer to the implant surface. The cell gradient and stability of the SMC layer strongly suggests a mechanism of active cell suppression, a possibility never explored in the scientific literature for metallic materials. Following these findings, we propose to explore the effect of metal biodegradation rate on formation of neointimal hyperplasia. Biodegradation rate will be controlled through a refinement of zinc material microstructure (through varying processing and thermal treatments of the same material) and surface finish (varying conditions of electropolishing and anodization). Generating an improved suppression of SMCs by regulating the flux of biocorrosion products is, in our opinion, a new direction for rational metallurgical engineering of biodegradable Zn implants. This exploratory direction could lay the groundwork to pioneer a new integrative field of materials science and biomedical engineering."
"9431289","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Obesity and other weight-related problems, including poor dietary intake, inadequate physical activity, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating behaviors, are of major public health concern, given their high prevalence and serious health consequences. The high prevalence of these problems in young people from low-income and ethnic/racial minority groups is of particular concern. This program of research aims to identify multi-level factors influencing a broad range of weight-related problems throughout key stages of the life course to guide the development of highly innovative, culturally acceptable, and effective interventions for populations in greatest need. The focus will be on the transition from adolescence to adulthood, an understudied, but important, period of life for the development of weight problems. This program of research is aimed at achieving the Principal Investigator's vision whereby young people from all backgrounds will have positive weight-related health, with support from their family, friends, schools, worksites, and neighborhoods.  This Outstanding Investigator Award (R35-OIA) will support a highly productive and effective researcher and her team in a manner that will promote creativity, allow strategic risk-taking, and have a great impact on weight-related problems. The program of research combines a longstanding and well-defined cohort study with a flexible plan to address emerging topics of interest. The research program builds and expands upon the Project EAT (Eating and Activity in Teens and Young Adults) studies, the largest and most comprehensive longitudinal body of research examining multi-level predictors of a broad range of weight-related problems in young people. The research program will include the following: 1) 12-year longitudinal, multi-level follow-up data collection on weight-related problems from a diverse sample of young people (N=2,793) and their family, friend, school, worksite, and neighborhood environments; 2) intermediate and rapid response survey mechanisms to capture short-term changes and assess the impact of societal changes and emerging policies of potential relevance to weight-related outcomes; 3) innovative substudies using multiple methods for in-depth explorations of multi-level etiological processes to guide intervention development; and 4) a mentored training program for new investigators who will shape the future of the field of young adult weight-related health.  This OIA comprehensive program of research will lead to the development of multi-level explanatory models for weight-related problems in young people and interventions for populations at greatest risk. Integration of a strong training program will ensure that the next generation of public health professionals has the tools to prevent marginalized populations from continuing to carry the burden of weight-related problems. Thus, this program of research builds on the NHLBI Strategic Vision, particularly regarding the objectives: 1) to investigate factors that account for differences in health among populations; and 2) to develop, diversify, and sustain a scientific workforce capable of accomplishing NHLBI's mission."
"9406151","PROJECT SUMMARY  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity complicating preterm birth and predicts poor pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Despite the well-documented association between inflammation and BPD, no safe and effective anti-inflammatory therapies to prevent BPD are currently available. How the neonatal innate immune response contributes to the pathogenesis of BPD is unknown, limiting therapeutic options. Our overarching aim is to determine the molecular mechanisms linking the neonatal innate immune response and impaired lung development that contributes to the pathogenesis of BPD. Importantly, recent studies in my laboratory identified a developmentally-regulated, hepatic-specific pattern of expression for key inhibitory proteins of the transcription factor NF?B. As NF?B plays a central role in regulating innate immunity, these findings have led us to propose a new organizing hypothesis linking the neonatal hepatic innate immune response to pulmonary injury. We hypothesize that the hepatic expression profile of the I?B family of NF?B inhibitory proteins results in a sustained pro-inflammatory innate immune response to systemic inflammatory stress that contributes to ongoing pulmonary inflammation, injury and impaired development. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis and determine the immunologic cross-talk between the developing lung and liver. In Aim 1, we will test whether the intracellular balance of I?B?/I?B? dictates the magnitude, duration and selectivity of the inflammatory-stress induced NF?B transcriptome. In Aim 2, we will test whether a robust and sustained pro-inflammatory neonatal innate immune response contributes to lung injury and abnormal development. In Aim 3, we will test whether inhibiting inflammatory stress-induced, I?B?-mediated hepatic NF?B signaling prevents prolonged pro-inflammatory gene expression and attenuates neonatal lung injury. Our hypothesis represents a paradigm shift in how we approach the prevention of BPD by linking a sustained pro-inflammatory neonatal innate immune response mediated by hepatic I?B?/NF?B signaling to lung injury and subsequent abnormal development. These studies will provide the foundation for translational work aimed at pharmacologically targeting I?B? /NF?B signaling to prevent BPD in at-risk infants."
"9433880","Summary Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp), have emerged as a serious hospital-acquired pathogen causing considerable morbidity and mortality in the USA and worldwide. Currently, limited and less effective treatment options are available. ?Old generation? agents, such as the polymyxins (polymyxin B and colistin) have been reintroduced as last-resort agents to treat life-threating carbapenem resistant infections. However, poor dosing of patients, its use as monotherapy or in combination with less effective agents, and its use in livestock, have resulted in the global emergence of colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Local and global molecular surveillance studies showed that 10%-20% CRKp isolates were resistant to colistin in comparison to ~2% in carbapenem susceptible isolates. Recent identification of plasmid mediated Mcr-1 colistin resistance further complicate the battle against CRKp infections. Colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae is mainly due to chromosomal gene mutations in two component systems (TCSs) and its negative regulators. The result is lipopolysaccharide (LPS) modification; however, direct causal effect of a given mutation and resistance remains unclear, and the correlation between mutations and resistance levels remains unknown. As is the nature of cross-talk among TCSs, complicated regulatory networks underscore colistin resistance, and distinct changes in expression pathways were found in colistin resistant K. pneumoniae using RNAseq transcriptome analysis. Significantly, no mutations in the known colistin resistance genes were identified in ~25% of resistant isolates in our preliminary study, suggesting that additional genes are involved in colistin resistance. Here we hypothesize that various chromosomal mutations contribute to diverse colistin resistance outcomes and levels, likely involving differential regulatory pathways, some revealed and others yet to be discovered. In this proposal we will utilize our established genetic and genomic platforms to 1) understand the most common molecular mechanisms of colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae locally, regional and globally; 2) correlate distinct gene mutants to the resistance levels; and 3) unravel novel resistance mechanisms. We will capture and characterize a large collection of colistin resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from local (NY, NJ and PA), and regional (across US) and global sources, and select representative isolates for whole genome sequencing to reveal the most common genotypes associated with colistin resistance (Aim 1). We will use the cutting-edging CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to generate isogenic strains for those most common gene mutations, and directly evaluate their contribution to colistin MICs, followed by RNAseq transcriptome analysis to reveal differential gene expression pathways underling the resistance (Aim 2). In addition, novel resistance mechanisms will be unraveled using the combination of WGS and RNAseq analysis, and confirmed by CRISPR/Cas9 (Aim 2). Successful completion of this proposal will increase our understanding of colistin resistance and will produce a curated collection of chromosomal mutants in a common genetic background with defined MICs and expression profiles, which will greatly facilitate future drug discovery, diagnostic programs, and studies of strain fitness and pathogenesis."
"9390411","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The goal of the proposed study is to perform a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a novel integrative exercise program called Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIÉ) on function and quality of life in older Veterans living in the community with dementia. Dementia is a devastating condition that affects nearly 1 in 10 older veterans (~1 million individuals). Current dementia medications have minimal impact on function and quality of life and do not stop or slow the disease course; however, there is growing evidence that behavioral interventions such as exercise have a variety of beneficial effects in individuals with dementia. PLIÉ was developed based on recent discoveries in neuroscience and experimental psychology that have found that, although explicit memory (the ability to consciously recall new information) is impaired in individuals with dementia, implicit memory (unconscious learning that typically occurs through repeated exposure) is relatively preserved. Therefore, PLIÉ focuses on training procedural memory (unconscious learning of procedures) to build the strength and capacity to perform the movements that are most needed for daily function (e.g., transitioning safely from sitting to standing). In addition, to maximize the benefits of the training, PLIÉ integrates elements of Eastern and Western exercise modalities to develop mindful body awareness and enhance social connection. We have recently completed a pilot study of the PLIÉ program at an adult day health center in San Francisco, CA, finding that it was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in cognitive function, physical performance and quality of life as well as reduced caregiver burden when compared with usual care at the facility. The proposed study will enable us to build on these exciting pilot study results by performing a full-scale RCT at adult day health centers in Northern California. Most VA Medical Centers currently contract with community-based organizations to provide adult day health care to eligible Veterans with dementia. Therefore, sites for the current study will be adult day health centers that have current contracts with either the San Francisco VA (SFVA) or Palo Alto VA (PAVA).  Within each center, study participants will be randomly assigned to receive the PLIÉ intervention program (45 minutes, 2 days/week, 6 months) or Usual Care (UC) control (standard center activities, 45 minutes, 2 days/week, 6 months) (N=144, 72/group). Our co-primary outcomes will be 6-month change in cognitive function (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale, ADAS-cog), independence (Functional Independence Measure, FIM) and quality of life (Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease, QOL-AD). Changes in caregiver burden (Caregiver Burden Inventory, CBI) will be examined as a secondary outcome. We also propose to determine whether the effects of PLIÉ are maintained over 6 months after the intervention period; thus, all outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. The proposed project will address a critically important Veterans' health problem related to optimizing functional status and quality of life in older Veterans with dementia. It is directly responsive to  Request for Applications (RFA) RX-14-011 (RR&D Merit Review Award for Research on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease), which has identified pioneering new and innovative rehabilitation methodologies to restore function and improve quality of life for Veterans living with [these] neurodegenerative diseases as a major focus. Many patients and caregivers currently feel that little is being done to help individuals with dementia maintain function and quality of life. Our proposed study will utilize rigorous research methods to test the efficacy of a highly innovative and promising new program for older adults with dementia. If our program is successful, we will work with VA and community-based organization to implement PLIÉ more broadly."
"9609662","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY: The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased more than six fold over the past three decades. Chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), where acidic bile salts abnormally refluxate into the esophagus. leads to the development of Barrett's esophagus (BE), a premalignant condition that is the main risk factor for EAC. We and others have shown that chronic exposure of BE cells to acidic bile salts induces inflammation and is associated with a dramatic increase in the burden of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress: believed to be the main driving forces for disruption of cellular signaling mechanisms and the development of EAC. Exposure to oxidative stress can alter the redox status of reactive cysteine residues, located within the DNA-binding domain of some transcription factors (TFs), thereby modulating their activity and DNA binding affinity. Therefore, the cellular redox capacity is paramount in protecting these redox-sensitive TFs. The exposure of cells to oxidative agents and oxidative stress also leads to formation of pre-mutagenic apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA molecules, which if unrepaired, lead to the formation and accumulation of additional DNA damage lesions, up to lethal levels. It is unknown how Barrett's and EAC can escape the oxidative effects of acidic bile salts reflux and also become resistant to currently used chemotherapeutic agents. APE1 is the only known protein with dual functions; 1) base excision repair (BER) activity, an important function for repair of oxidative DNA lesions, 2) redox-dependent functions that protect the cellular transcription machinery. In this proposal, we plan to characterize the molecular function(s) of APE1, a frequently overexpressed gene in EAC, in order to identify its biological, diagnostic, prognostic, and possibly therapeutic significance. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that APE1 can promote the oncogenic pro-survival properties of Barrett's cancer cells through redox-dependent and independent (BER) functions. In aim 1, we will investigate the interplay between cellular localization, structure (BER and redox domains) and functions of APE1 in Barrett's carcinogenesis. In aim 2, we will examine the APE1-dependent redox functions in Barrett's carcinogenesis. The clinical significance and therapeutic potential of APE1 in EAC will be determined in aim 3. Upon completion of our work, we expect to unveil a new paradigm for the protective molecular mechanisms against oxidative stress in Barrett's carcinogenesis."
"9446030","Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies."
"9468619","Project Summary: Perturbation of Polycomb-mediated gene repression by histone H3 mutations Recurrent missense mutations in genes encoding histone H3 that substitute lysine to methionine (H3 ?K-to-M? mutations) were recently identified in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (H3K27M)1,2 and a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and undifferentiated pediatric sarcomas (H3K36M)4,5 that together are characterized by poor prognosis and have few effective treatment options.6,14,15 Biochemical and structural data indicate that H3K27M and H3K36M dominantly inhibit the specific histone methyltransferases (HMTs) for each lysine in trans.4,7-12 However, how these histone mutants promote malignant transformation is largely unknown, with initial work implicating aberrant Polycomb-mediated gene repression in cells expressing either mutation.4,13 My preliminary evidence suggests that crosstalk between histone methylation and DNA methylation is responsible for redistribution of H3K27me3-binding Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) in H3K36M mesenchymal progenitor cells that promotes a neoplastic undifferentiated state through derepression of polycomb target genes. In Aim 1, I plan to (a) test the hypothesis that loss of the DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b recapitulates the chromatin landscape changes elicited by H3K36M, and (b) determine if recruitment of DNMT3a/b to chromatin is impacted downstream of HMT inhibition by H3K36M. Expression of H3K27M similarly derepresses polycomb target genes, however my preliminary data suggests that it is not phenotypically equivalent to chemical inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase PRC2, possibly due to the persistence of H3K27me3 islands at select genomic loci that have been implicated in DIPG tumor maintenance.13 To better understand the formation and function of these persistent islands, in Aim 2 I seek to (a) identify genes that maintain Polycomb-mediated repression in H3K27M cells, and (b) determine if the genomic position of H3K27M influences where H3K27me3 islands form genome-wide. Through these studies, I expect to gain insight into the chromatin landscape changes induced by H3 ?K-to-M? mutations that perturb Polycomb-mediated gene repression to drive oncogenesis, which will provide a basis for developing new therapeutic strategies."
"9454818","Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites."
"9423683","SUMMARY As key directors of intracellular trafficking, phosphotidylinsotides (PIs) are a family of low abundance lipids that impact almost every process within the eukaryotic cell. The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a major determinant of blood LDL levels, is the most efficacious therapeutic target for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Upon LDL binding, LDLR at the cell surface is internalized, where it releases the bound LDL and then recycles back to the cell surface or is directed to the lysosome for degradation. Recently, we found that knock- down of transmembrane protein 55B (TMEM55B), a phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P] phosphatase, stimulated decay of LDLR protein in cells and raised plasma LDLC in mice. Since PI(4,5)P is involved in lysosome formation, we hypothesize that PI(4,5)P phosphatases (such as TMEM55B) may alter LDLC by regulating LDLR intracellular trafficking. We also found that reduction of PI(4,5)P phosphatases caused severely impaired secretion of triglycerides into plasma. Notably, this occurred without the accumulation of liver fat, and interestingly, was observed only in male mice, with no effect in females. The lack of hepatic fat accumulation may be attributed to a number of different mechanisms including increased lipophagy (a process of selective autophagy in which lipid droplets are targeted for lysosomal decay). PI(4,5)P is an important regulator of lysosome reformation after autophagosome fusion, and we found that TMEM55B knock-down increased lysosomes. These findings suggest that PI(4,5)P phosphatases may modulate hepatic TG secretion and storage through a lysosome-dependent mechanism. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to evaluate the role of PI(4,5)P in LDLR recycling and TG secretion. In Aim 1 we will i) Test if PI(4,5)P metabolizing enzymes impact plasma LDL in the absence of LDLR using genetically modified mouse models; ii) Evaluate the effect of modifying PI(4,5)P on Ldlr intracellular levels and localization in mouse hepatocytes; iii) Test if expression of enzymatically inactive Tmem55b rescues the phenotypes observed in the Tmem55b knockout mouse; and iv) Evaluate if PI(4,5)P phosphatase regulation of LDLR recycling is dependent on known regulators of LDLR decay. In Aim 2 we will i) Compare TG secretion in whole body versus liver-specific Tmem55b knockout male mice to confirm that the defect is a hepatic mechanism; ii) Test if lack of hepatic fat accumulation, as would be expected to result from impaired TG secretion, in hepatocytes from Tmem55b knockout mice is due to changes in fatty acid oxidation, synthesis, or uptake, or TG synthesis; iii) Determine PI(4,5)P phosphatases depend on lysosome and/or autophagosomes to impair TG secretion; and iv) Evaluate if the sex-specific effect of PI(4,5)P modulation of TG secretion is due to the sex chromosome complement (XX vs. XY) and/or gonadal hormones. Investigation of the role of PI(4,5)P in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism may lead to the development of new therapeutic options for reducing cardiometabolic disease risk."
"9469699","PROJECT SUMMARY Mutations in the X-linked gene encoding cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) cause the childhood epileptic encephalopathy known as CDKL5 disorder. The disease is characterized by a heterogeneous array of clinical symptoms including early-onset seizures, marked hypotonia, autistic-like features, and severe neurodevelopmental impairment. To confirm the genetic causality of CDKL5 disorder, we generated the first Cdkl5 knockout (KO) mouse and found that mice lacking CDKL5 mirror several hallmark symptoms of the human disease, including autistic-like behaviors, impaired motor control, disrupted auditory-evoked event- related potentials, and poor learning and memory. Interestingly, Cdkl5 KO mice also exhibit perturbed dendritic spine density, morphology, and LTP. These early findings suggest an important role for CDKL5 in neuronal synapse function. However, CDKL5?s specific role in this context, particularly post-development, remains unknown. Given these synaptic phenotypes caused by CDKL5 loss, and my recent preliminary data using a novel adult KO model of CDKL5, I hypothesize that CDKL5 expression is required in adulthood to maintain proper synaptic homeostasis, circuit communication, and behavioral output. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to elucidate the adulthood requirement of CDKL5 in synaptic function by 1) determining the sufficiency of CDKL5 in restoring loss-of-function circuit and behavioral deficits at adulthood and 2) determining the extent to which CDKL5 modulates synaptic density and morphology in vivo. My ultimate goal is to determine a novel role for CDKL5 in the maintenance of adult neural function. These studies will provide essential preclinical information regarding disease reversibility, and pave the way for the future development of more targeted therapeutics for CDKL5 disorder patients."
"9419511","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The TGF? signaling pathway has been extensively studied in vascular disease, but there remains considerable controversy regarding the direction and mechanism of effect for how this pathway impacts human coronary artery disease (CAD). Recent genome-wide association studies have identified several loci that harbor TGF? family genes, including the SMAD3 gene at 15q22.33 that encodes a transcription factor critical for converting TGF?-induced cytoplasmic signaling to gene expression changes, and ZEB2 and SKI at 2q22.3 and 1p36.33 respectively, which bind SMAD3 and modulate its transcriptional activity. Studies in this lab have employed histone modification, chromosomal accessibility, allele-specific expression, in vitro genome editing and transgenic reporter mouse studies to identify SMAD3 as the causal gene at 15q22.33. The protective allele for this gene disrupts a potent intronic enhancer in the SMAD3 gene that is associated with decreased SMAD3 expression in vascular tissues, suggesting that expression of SMAD3 in SMC promotes risk for CAD. In SMC, TGF? signaling is known to have important differentiative and anti-proliferative roles during vascular development, but this function may be deleterious in the disease setting where SMC dedifferentiation and proliferation, ?phenotypic modulation,? allows this cell type to bolster structural integrity and retard plaque rupture. A disease-promoting role for TGF? is supported by our studies with TCF21, a CAD associated transcription factor that promotes SMC phenotypic modulation and whose protective allele confers increased expression. Taken together, these data suggest our Central Hypothesis: the TGF? signaling molecule SMAD3, in conjunction with ZEB2 and SKI, regulates a transcriptional network that mediates the adaptive SMC phenotypic response to vascular stress, with allelic variation modulating this response contributing to CAD risk. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 in the ApoE-/- atherosclerosis mouse model will evaluate disease anatomy with SMC-specific deletion of Smad3, along with human risk and protective haplotypes created by genome editing. Lineage tracing and single cell RNA-seq will define the role of Smad3 in regulating the cellular response to disease stimuli, and molecular phenotype as lesion SMC dedifferentiate and contribute to the macrophage lineage. In Aim 2, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq studies in human coronary artery SMC will define the network of genes that are regulated by SMAD3 and investigate how expression of ZEB2 and SKI modulates the molecular composition of this network. In vitro studies in human coronary artery SMC in Aim 3 will identify the cellular and molecular processes that are mediated by SMAD3 and how these functions are modified by ZEB2 and SKI. Taken together, these studies will significantly advance our understanding of how SMAD3 and related factors ZEB2 and SKI govern the SMC phenotypic response to vascular disease, and how perturbation of their function contributes to CAD risk."
"9538361","PROJECT SUMMARY Polymicrobial infections are a common and devastating feature of many lung diseases, including those associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). The opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, infects ~50% of CF patients, and a significant number of these patients are subsequently co-infected with members of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), a group of 17 closely-related Burkholderia species.1,2 These species form co-biofilms in the CF lung,3 which are associated with rapid decline in pulmonary function. The intrinsic and evolved antibiotic resistance of these bacteria within these co-biofilms make for very limited treatment options. Recently, antivirulence strategies?i.e., therapies that render bacteria avirulent without targeting essential cellular processes?have attracted considerable interest as a strategy to address bacterial pathogenicity without applying selective pressure.4,5 Both P. aeruginosa and Burkholderia species coordinate virulence phenotypes and biofilm production by deploying acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signals for cell-to-cell communication (or quorum sensing (QS)). Moreover, they appear to be more virulent in co-infections as opposed to alone, suggesting that there may be interspecies interactions that facilitate this enhancement. Manipulation of QS pathways has emerged as one potentially powerful antivirulence strategy and is a primary research focus of the Blackwell lab.6-8 We hypothesize that QS plays a role in augmenting virulence in P. aeruginosa:Bcc co-infections. The broad goal of this project is to test this hypothesis through an integrated set of modern chemical biology, organic chemistry, microbiology, and molecular biology approaches. Despite the advances in developing synthetic QS modulators for P. aeruginosa, minimal work has been focused on identifying compounds that target QS in Burkholderia species. In Aim 1, I will identify and synthesize novel chemical modulators of QS for the Bcc, confirm their ability to modify virulence phenotypes, and evaluate their ability to attenuate C. elegans infections. These compounds will represent powerful tools to explore the role of QS in infection, and we believe they could provide new entry into study of the role of QS in co-infections, such as those in the CF lung. In Aims 2 and 3, I will assess the ability for P. aeruginosa to co-biofilm and co-infect C. elegans with range of Bcc member species. Furthermore, I will dissect the role of QS in these co-infections using species-specific chemical tools. Finally, I will challenge compound-treated co-infections with antibiotics, to evaluate if our best QS modulators render the co-infections or co-biofilms more susceptible to antibiotic treatment. The results of the proposed experiments will be highly impactful and novel as they will assess of the role of QS in co-infections between these two destructive pathogens for the first time, and they will further the use of antivirulence strategies as an innovative way to treat infection."
"9415452","Cardiovascular disorders (CVD), including coronary artery disease (CAD) and congenital hear diseases (CHD) are the leading causes of death in the United States. Despite strong contribution of genetic factors to CVD, very little is known about the underlying genetic causes of these diseases. We have embarked on high throughput sequencing and high throughput in vivo characterization of genes underlying CVD in outlier kindreds and in offsprings of consanguineous unions. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and state of the art analytic approaches, from linkage to gene set enrichment analysis, we have identified independent mutations that underlie CAD, metabolic syndrome and diverse CHD. Our success in identification of disease genes is in part due to access to unique disease populations across the world and the support of Yale Center for Mendelian Genomics. While we have devised inventive approaches for novel gene discovery, the distinctive feature of our laboratory is in pursuing the characterization of disease genes in vivo and its success in identifying novel disease pathways and targets for drug development. We have established high throughput techniques in the lab for functional characterization of identified human mutations in vitro and in vivo by employing novel gene editing techniques. Most recently, we have begun to investigate the epigenetic effects of aging, diet and physical activity on disease pathogenesis in human and animal models. Most notably, we have taken a step further and have initiated collaborative efforts with the industry in order to screen and characterize small molecules that can target identified disease pathways in order to rescue cardiovascular and metabolic traits. Our highly cited published work is an attest for the quality and the promising nature of the results we generate in the lab."
"9405016","The BioCAT Biotechnology Research Resource operates X-ray beamline 18ID at the Advanced Photon  Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Now in its 20th year of operation, it is a mature, productive facility with  many capabilities unique in the USA, and, arguably, the world. Going forward, we intend to maintain our world-  class capabilities in static, time- and spatially-resolved fiber diffraction with beamline enhancements for  increased flux and beam quality. A novel high speed, high sensitivity, high spatial resolution pixel array  detector will provide an excellent match to the needs of our muscle diffraction program. Also proposed is a  versatile micro-diffraction/micro-SAXS instrument that can use one of two Compound Refractive Lenses  optimized for either wide- or small-angle fiber crystallography, and continuous flow SAXS experiments. We will  implement multimodal scanning micro-diffraction, x-ray florescence microscopy, phase contrast and uv/visible  imaging that can be done either singly or in combination with the same instrument on the same samples.  Developments in time-resolved SAXS will extend available time regimes from 500 ns to seconds with major  reductions in sample consumption, by more than order of magnitude, from current capabilities. This will allow  a much wider range of biomedical problems to be addressed than previously possible. A new beamline data  acquisition and control system will provide a common interface and better data management for all  experiments and advanced support for time resolved experiments. Combined refractive index, dynamic light  scattering and multi-angle light scattering measurements with SAXS will offer more comprehensive sample  characterization on-line for more robust results. A multi-scale modeling effort will allow extracting more  information from muscle X-ray diffraction studies. The proposed developments in multi-scale simulations for  interpreting single molecule SAXS data will profoundly benefit studies of multicomponent systems that show  considerable conformational heterogeneity. Our relationship with the CCP-SAS project will enable us to widely  disseminate the advanced modeling tools we create to not only all our DBP's, collaborative and service users  but to the wider biomedical community. Our Driving Biomedical Projects, collaborative, and service projects  have relevance to basic mechanisms of muscle function, heart disease, retinitis pigmentosa, cancer and  neuro-degenerative diseases. Our proposed training activities are designed to ensure safe, efficient and  productive use of the resource by our users.

"9451082","ABSTRACT A major goal in clinical neuroscience is to develop efficient treatments to prevent or minimize the loss of brain function caused by pathological decreases or increases of neuronal activity, which are hallmarks of a wide variety of neurological disorders. Interestingly, in some instances, the brain has evolved mechanisms to partially correct abnormal neuronal function. Understanding the adaptive mechanisms that restore brain function would not only provide insight into the functioning of the normal brain but also guide future approaches to ameliorate loss of brain function caused by disease or injury. We propose to start a research program to investigate the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which the brain maintains constant behavioral output, even when neuronal activity is naturally variable or it is perturbed. Our preliminary evidence with songbirds indicate that the brain circuits involved in song production demonstrate a high level of behavioral resilience both at short and long timescales. At the short timescale the patterns of firing of premotor neurons directly involved in song production vary from day to day, although there is no measurable variability in the song. At the long timescale, we genetically perturbed the activity of these premotor neurons and this caused a dramatic disruption of song. However, manipulated birds fully recovered from the perturbation, and were able to produce their original song after around 10 days. We will build on these results to explore the neuronal mechanisms that ensure behavioral resilience in a brain circuit involved in a complex behavior using gene delivery, optogenetics, in vivo functional imaging, behavioral analysis, and computational modelling."
"9451093","ABSTRACT Persistent neural activity, a sustained response following brief stimuli that is observed in many brain networks, needs to be appropriately tuned to meet the exacting demands of various motor and cognitive tasks. One task that has been particularly amenable to understanding persistent neural activity is the oculomotor control of gaze position. In the oculomotor system, where persistent activity maintains the appropriate gaze angle necessary for high-acuity vision, this tuning arises in large part through an interaction loop between the cerebellum and the oculomotor neural integrator, a brainstem structure that temporally integrates eye velocity commands to generate eye position encoding signals. Whereas we understand a fair bit about the coding properties and signal transformations within the cerebellum and especially the neural integrator proper, the interactions between these key brain centers is poorly understood. Here we aim to close this gap through an integrative approach using a combination of whole-network two-photon imaging, targeted optical perturbations, serial-section electron microscopy, in-vivo electrophysiology, and next-generation network modeling. In Aim 1, we will combine volumetric imaging of neuronal dynamics in the zebrafish with learning and targeted perturbations to examine the causal relationships between cerebellar and integrator populations. In Aim 2, we will perform high-resolution serial-section electron microscopy of a functionally imaged brain to gain insight into the global circuit's anatomical connectivity. In Aim 3, we will directly fit a network model to these dynamical and structural data to find the physiological interaction patterns in the circuit and predict the sites of plasticity. In Aim 4, we will probe predicted sites of plasticity using cell-targeted optical stimulations and whole-cell patch recordings. These tools and results will enable concrete predictions about the circuit mechanisms tuning persistent neural activity, guide understanding of the modular loops between the cerebellum and a wide range of other brain areas, and serve as a benchmark for efforts to understand the dynamics and plasticity of interactions across the brain."
"9529169","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs), which act swiftly and specifically, are ideal gene regulators in pathogens such as Coxiella burnetii that shift rapidly between disparate environments (e.g. aerosol vs. intracellular). However, very little is known about sRNAs that facilitate the pathogenicity of C. burnetii?a select agent that causes acute Q fever and chronic endocarditis. It is important that we gain better molecular insights into C. burnetii infection because it is found across the globe and has the potential to cause epidemics such as the recent outbreak in the Netherlands that involved more than 4,000 human cases and resulted in the culling of over 50,000 goats (a primary reservoir). Our long-term goal is to define the functions of non- coding RNAs during C. burnetii infection and to apply this knowledge to developing novel therapeutic ap- proaches. Towards attaining this goal, the objective of this application is to identify sRNAs that promote C. burnetii's growth within human cells. Based on preliminary data that identified several novel sRNAs in Cox- iella, our central hypothesis is that sRNAs promote intracellular growth of C. burnetii. The objectives of this project will be accomplished by two Specific Aims: (1) Identify sRNAs that are important to Coxiella's intra- cellular growth. Using RNA-seq we expect to identify sRNAs that are expressed during various stages of in- fection, and by examining transposon-insertion mutants we will assay their importance to intracellular growth. (2) Define the role of the sRNA CbsR14 in promoting Coxiella's intracellular growth. To begin to understand how sRNAs facilitate infection, we will interrogate the function of CbsR14, This sRNA was cho- sen because its expression was induced intracellularly, a transposon insertion in it significantly reduced Coxiella's intracellular growth, and preliminary analyses indicated that it targets the adjacent yidC gene. All studies to date on C. burnetii infection have only investigated proteins; hence, the research proposed here is innovative because it will depart from the status quo to investigate the role of non-coding RNAs in facilitat- ing Coxiella infection. This study is significant because it will, for the first time, identify sRNAs that pro- mote intracellular growth of C. burnetii. This new knowledge is expected to advance the field considerably by transforming our current understanding of Coxiella's pathogenicity. Additionally, uncovering the regula- tory circuit of YidC could be applicable to other organisms because this membrane protein is conserved across bacteria and mitochondria. Furthermore, the approaches we develop in this project will guide us (and others) to analyze other classes of non-coding RNAs (e.g. riboswitches) in Coxiella, and to examine sRNAs in other intractable intracellular pathogens such as Chlamydia, Rickettsia, Anaplasma and Ehrlichia. Moreover, a deeper understanding of sRNA-based gene regulation could contribute to the development of novel anti-Coxiella therapeutic agents that target critical components of the sRNA regulon."

This project will also aim to engage members of the community in assessing the validity of the focus group findings and the perceived importance and feasibility of potential screening and linkage to care intervention strategies, in order to inform development of a culturally-tailored, relevant intervention with potential to promote engagement in mental health services among high-risk young AA men. Despite greater risk for trauma, subsequent mental health concerns, and poor outcomes, young AA men are at less likely to receive mental health treatment than other racial/ethnic groups. Yet, theory-based studies on screening and LTC among young, urban AA males are lacking. This study will be conducted in two phases over 18 months and will collect data via focus groups, surveys, and a community forum. Participants in Phase 1 (N = 50) will be recruited from local college and university campuses, churches, and community-based organizations that serve AA young men. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), focus groups will be used to elicit behavioral, normative, and control beliefs regarding mental health service utilization. Surveys will be implemented concurrently, in order to quantitatively assess TPB constructs and other barriers to engagement in mental health services. In Phase 2, a community forum will be held for participants and interested members of the community, during which key study findings will be disseminated and feedback elicited on the relevance and importance of survey findings, including the mental health screening/LTC intervention strategies identified."
"9575133","Project Summary Discoveries made in sensory biology not only shape the way we live, but also have important repercussions for human health. My long-term career goal is to better understand how environmental cues are detected and encoded in the periphery, and communicated with the brain to control physiology and behavior in health and disease. My current objective described in this proposal is to investigate how GLP-1 communicates centrally with the subfornical organ to control water intake and body fluid homeostasis. Maintaining fluid homeostasis is crucial for health and disease. Elevation of circulatory osmolarity by high glucose causes polydipsia in diabetic patients. Incretin therapies that involve mimicry or stabilization of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) provide a strategy for treatment of type 2 diabetes. As an incretin, GLP-1 not only controls insulin release and feeding behavior but also regulates blood pressure, renal excretion of sodium, and fluid intake to coordinately promote digestion at a systematic level after meal. Intriguingly, acute GLP-1 administration elicits hypodipsia and effectively reduces water consumption in both healthy subjects and diabetic patients, suggesting an alternative strategy for alleviating polydipsia in diabetic patients. Among the many sites that express the receptor for GLP- 1 (GLP1R), the subfornical organ is a major brain center that controls water intake and fluid homeostasis. My central hypothesis is that SFO GLP1R neurons integrate satiety signals after meal to control fluid intake through specific signaling cascades and central neural circuits. I will test this hypothesis through three specific aims: to determine the effect of SFO GLP1R neuron stimulation on fluid intake (Specific Aim 1), to decipher GLP1R signaling pathways in these cells (Specific Aim 2), and to scrutinize their anatomical and functional connectivity (Specific Aim 3). For the training necessary for Specific Aim 2, I will continue to greatly benefit from the guidance of my mentor Prof. Liberles, who has incredible knowledge and understanding in GPCR signaling pathways. To carry out Specific Aim 1 and 3, I will also need to broaden my knowledge and skills to include mouse behavior and neurocircuit mapping, such as stereotaxic brain surgeries, brain slice electrophysiology, and chemogenetics. Such knowledge and skills will be obtained from training with my co- mentor, Prof. Bradford Lowell. I have received tremendous guidance from Prof. Lowell and his lab members in the past, with generation of Glp1r-ires-Cre mice and brain stereotaxic injection. I will continue to learn brain slice recording, rabies virus-based tracing, channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM), and DREADD-involved behavioral experiments under the guidance of Prof. Lowell. Particularly regarding the anatomical tracing of SFO GLP1R neurons (Specific Aim 3) that requires very extensive knowledge of brain anatomy, I will collaborate with Prof. Clifford Saper, who is an expert in neuroanatomy more than 40 years experience. Together, these studies will greatly expand our knowledge on how GLP-1 signal is integrated in the brain to coordinately control physiology and shed light on GLP-1 based drug design."
"9370986","Project Summary-Abstract: Mild to moderate hypoxic insults, attributed to apnea of prematurity, evoke disorders of minimal brain dysfunction with cognitive impairment. Yet, the underlying neuropathology is ill-defined. Our objective is to characterize dopaminergic structure and function in former preterm children who experienced postnatal hypoxic insults. We hypothesize that dopaminergic projections, originating in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) which modulate cognition and motor control, will be structurally and functionally impaired. To establish scientific premise for this proposal, we developed a rodent model emulating apnea of prematurity, which recapitulates many cognitive and behavioral impairments observed in post-hypoxic humans. Structural and neurochemical analyses within key brain regions subserving cognition and motor control revealed 1) reduced levels of extracellular dopamine, 2) increased protein expression of dopamine D-1 receptors, and 3) increased vesicular monoamine transporter within mesotenecephalic pathways. Those studies demonstrated, for the first time, that brief hypoxic insults occurring during the postnatal period impaired structure and function within dopaminergic circuits known to promote wakefulness, attention, locomotor activity and working memory. This proposed study represents the next logical step of our research. To enhance scientific rigor, we will use a cross-sectional two-arm trial design. Our study will enroll 20 former preterm children, now 8-11 years old, in whom we have characterized their postnatal hypoxic exposure continuously during their first eight weeks of life, and 10 healthy control children born at term and closely matched by age/sex/race. Aim 1 will employ Magnetic Resonance Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to quantify and compare the structural integrity of dopaminergic circuits originating in the SNpc and VTA between post-hypoxic former preterm children versus healthy control children. Aim 2 will employ Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with simultaneous High-Density Electroencephalography (HD-EEG) to quantify and compare functional activity in cortical brain regions associated with cognitive performance, within those same post-hypoxic former preterm children and healthy control children. Our findings will characterize and quantify the neuropathology attributed to mild to moderate hypoxic insults occurring in the postnatal period. This will inform future studies seeking to develop neuroprotective strategies for at-risk newborns as well as treatments to enhance function within the post-hypoxic infant."
"9527609","Project Summary/Abstract  Primary immunodeficiencies (PID) are caused by genetic mutations in the components of immune system. More than 300 subtypes of various PID have been described; and one major subgroup is classified as predominantly antibody de?ciency. Naïve B cells produce low affinity IgM antibodies. To develop long-term immune protection against pathogens, B cells must generate high-affinity isotype-switched antibodies such as IgG. To achieve this goal, B cells undergo class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Dysregulation of CSR can lead to PID such as Hyper IgM syndromes (HIGM). These are complex disorders of antibody deficiency that can be attributed to genetic mutations in various components of CSR/SHM such as activation-induced deaminase (AID), CD40, or ICOS. While many genetic mutations have been identified in PID patients with agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia, how these genetic mutations affect CSR process in a B cell intrinsic manner remains incompletely understood. Addressing such questions is highly significant, as dissection of the pathological mechanisms of antibody deficiencies will build the biological basis for new therapeutic strategies in PID.  In this application, we propose to establish a novel approach to evaluate how genetic variants cause antibody deficiency in the context of CSR defects. Despite large numbers of mutations recently identified in PID patients, the molecular and clinical heterogeneity represents a challenge for establishing genotype-phenotype correlations. We anticipate that next generation sequencing (NGS) technique will identify increasing numbers of mutations in patients with antibody deficiencies. However, NGS does not reveal the biological significance of identified mutations. Validation of genetic variants as disease-causing mutations still requires functional assays to explain patient-specific cellular and tissue pathophysiology. The conventional gene-targeting approaches are insufficient to reveal the biological significance of these mutations efficiently. Thus, we propose to apply new genome-editing approaches to accomplish such goals. Given our strong expertise in the CSR model and our previous work on the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in controlling CSR, we plan to develop a model system to test the genetic variants identified in the components of PI3K pathway. Such approaches can be readily expanded to determine the contribution of other factors to defects in CSR in PID patients. In addition, we propose to establish a novel system for functional testing of genetic variants using primary B cells. If successful, our proposed studies will lead to a high impact in PID field that may substantively accelerate the conversion of genomic studies into translational applications for PID patients."
"9413236","Title Donor tissue specific extracellular vesicle characterization for monitoring rejection in lung transplantation Project Summary (Abstract)  Lung transplantation remains the only curative therapy in patients with end stage respiratory failure. However, morbidity and mortality in lung transplant patients remains the highest amongst all solid organ transplants, and is directly associated with transplant lung rejection and complications of immunosuppression. Yet to this date, there is no reliable biomarker platform to monitor the transplant lung status. An accurate, non- invasive, time-sensitive biomarker platform would have significant translational impact on patient survival and quality of life as it would enable early intervention and immunosuppression titration.  Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, are released by many tissues into peripheral circulation. EVs represent stable and tissue-specific proteomic and RNA signature profiles that reflect the conditional state of their tissue of origin. Tissue specific EV profiles and their RNA signatures are distinct in conditions of health versus injury/ pathology. Therefore, understanding tissue specific EV profiles from bodily fluids has promise to serve as a ?liquid biopsy? of the status of their tissue of origin. But no group has studied tissue specific EV profiles in transplantation. From work done over the past three years in our laboratory, we found that transplanted tissues/ organs release a stable and detectable pool of donor-specific EVs into the recipient blood/ bodily fluids. Further, immune rejection of the transplanted tissue leads to distinct changes in the donor EV quantity and in their proteomic and microRNA profiles. These findings have now been validated in the clinical setting. In this mentored research project we propose to investigate the role of donor lung specific EV proteomic and RNA signatures from recipient plasma as a novel biomarker platform in the field of lung transplantation diagnostics.  Since no study to date has characterized transplant lung specific and recipient immune cell EV pools, we propose to investigate this novel concept in two in vivo transplant models: (1) established mouse model of orthotopic lung transplantation under controlled settings of acute rejection versus acceptance, and; (2) human lung transplantation. In both settings we will characterize transplant lung specific and recipient T cell specific EV pools, their proteomic and RNA signatures in conditions of health versus rejection to discover distinct profiles associated with transplant rejection. Successful completion of this project proposal would lay the foundation for future development of a non-invasive, EV-based novel biomarker assay to monitor lung transplant rejection."
"9395925","Motile cilia are present in the epithelial cells of brain ventricles, trachea, oviduct, and sperm flagella. They play important roles in vivo including maintaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, clearing particles and pathogens from the respiratory tract, and sperm motility. Defects in motile cilia result in multiple diseases such as hydrocephalus, situs inversus, male infertility and et al. Most motile cilia have a ?9+2? axoneme. The shared structure of motile cilia in different tissues suggests that common regulatory mechanisms exist to govern expression of cilia/flagellar components. We hypothesize that expression of the genes essential for motile cilia structure/function are regulated by similar mechanisms so that the proteins are assembled into the motile cilia in a coordinated and timely manner. Sperm flagella are special motile cilia. Besides the core axoneme, other accessory structures are also assembled during spermiogenesis, the process of spermatid differentiation. During this phase, a number of genes essential for sperm flagella assembly are up-regulated. However, the transcriptional regulation of this suite of genes is poorly understood. By analyzing putative transcription factor binding sites in the promoter regions of genes that are essential for sperm flagella structure/function, we identified SOX5 as a putative key controller of cilia/flagellar genes. Sox-5 is a member of a family of genes that shows homology to the high motility group (HMG) box region of the testis determining gene, SRY. The mouse Sox5 gene encodes two major transcripts: the longer Sox5 isoform, originally named L-Sox5, but most authors refer it as Sox5; and a shorter isoform, S-Sox5. The first exon of the S-Sox5 transcript is a non-translated exon;, and it is not present in the L-Sox5 transcript. The translated 48 kDa S-SOX5 protein lacks the N-terminal half of the 84 kDa L-SOX5 protein. The two SOX5 proteins have different tissue distributions. L-SOX5 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the cartilage, heart, brain, kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle, but not in the testis, and it plays important roles in regulating processes of embryonic development and cell fate determination. S-SOX5 protein is only expressed in tissues with motile cilia, including the brain, lungs, and particularly in the testis. In the testis, it is localized in the nuclei of post-meiotic round spermatids. It has been shown that S-SOX5 regulates expression of several genes highly expressed in the testis. We hypothesize that S-SOX5 regulates expression of a suite of genes that are essential for sperm flagella formation and function. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims:1. To establish the critical the role of S-SOX5 in flagellogenesis and male fertility; and 2. To establish the target genes regulated by S-SOX5 in male germ cells. The proposed studies will help clarify the combinatorial transcription factor code that governs the differentiation and structural transformation of mammalian male germ cells. The tools that will be developed in pursuit of the proposed research will allow us to expand the project to a RO1 application to elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms that control mammalian sperm maturation."
"9430873","Project Summary Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common and severe form of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), is increasing in prevalence, and has a median survival of 3-5 years. Recent studies have finally demonstrated that anti- fibrotic therapy can reduce the rate of decline in lung function, IPF remains a relentlessly progressive condition in part due to the advanced stages of PF at the time of presentation. There is also evidence that anti-fibrotic therapy reduces progression in patients with less severe disease; which suggests that early detection may improve outcomes. Dr. Putman?s work has shown that the early stages of PF are detectable, that radiologic progression is relatively frequent, is correlated with genetic factors seen in IPF patients (e.g. MUC5B genotype), and is associated with an accelerated rate of lung function decline and an increased risk of death. Although much work has been done to demonstrate that imaging analyses can detect patterns that help to predict adverse outcomes in IPF, it is unclear what radiologic characteristics of ILA best predict accelerated progression and mortality. Additionally, numerous studies have demonstrated that mean telomere length (MTL), and variants in multiple genes controlling MTL are associated with IPF and reduced survival, the role of these factors in determining the progression and mortality associated with ILA is not known. In the first aim, Dr. Putman will identify the radiologic factors, both qualitative and quantitative, that are most associated with the progression of PF, and relate these findings to clinical outcomes. In the second aim she will explore the relationship between reduced MTL and the progression of early stage PF. Finally, in the third aim, using whole genome sequencing data, she will explore the relationship between genetic mutations in the telomerase pathway and progression of early stage pulmonary fibrosis. This work will be performed in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, at Brigham and Women?s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. Dr. Putman will perform this work under the mentorship of Dr. Hunninghake, an expert in the field of early pulmonary fibrosis and Dr. Silverman, an expert in COPD genetics. With the guidance of her mentors and scientific advisory committee, Dr. Putman has developed a comprehensive five year training program to develop the skills needed to become an independent investigator with expertise in complex genetic analyses and their integration with image characterization. Dr. Putman is dedicated to a career in academic medicine. Her goal is to become a clinician-scientist using the skills gained during this award to better our understanding of the biologic processes that lead to PF occurrence and progression. She plans to use the knowledge gained from this award to study the downstream consequences of decreased MTL; with the ultimate goal of improving care and outcomes in patients with PF."

Developments in time-resolved SAXS will extend available time regimes from 500 ns to seconds with major  reductions in sample consumption, by more than order of magnitude, from current capabilities. This will allow  a much wider range of biomedical problems to be addressed than previously possible. A new beamline data  acquisition and control system will provide a common interface and better data management for all  experiments and advanced support for time resolved experiments. Combined refractive index, dynamic light  scattering and multi-angle light scattering measurements with SAXS will offer more comprehensive sample  characterization on-line for more robust results. A multi-scale modeling effort will allow extracting more  information from muscle X-ray diffraction studies. The proposed developments in multi-scale simulations for  interpreting single molecule SAXS data will profoundly benefit studies of multicomponent systems that show  considerable conformational heterogeneity.

"9408615","Malaria is a major health problem throughout the tropical world and is transmitted by a variety of Anopheles mosquitoes. Core vector control interventions consist of indoor residual spraying of insecticides and long- lasting insecticidal nets. These are logical strategies in areas where the primary vector species feed at night on people sleeping in their houses and where mosquitoes rest inside the house after blood-feeding. But in Central America, much of the malaria transmission is due to malaria vectors that are exophagic (i.e., prefer to bite outdoors), exophilic (i.e., prefer to remain outdoors), and zoophaghic (i.e., as likely to feed on non-humans as humans). To control mosquitoes with these behavioral characteristics requires a different approach. This proposal addresses the control of zoophagic vectors. Hypothesis: Targeted use of endectocides in peridomestic livestock can significantly reduce the survival and longevity of zoophagic Anopheles vectors that feed on treated cattle. Because zoophagic vectors are responsible for much of the malaria transmission in Central America, malaria transmission will be reduced in areas where endectocides are given to livestock. This proposal will determine if endectocides, when administered to cattle, reduces the survival and fecundity of zoophagic malaria vectors in Central America. Significance: If experimental results support the hypothesis, then it is probable that malaria transmission can be reduced in areas where mass drug administration (MDA) of endectocides in livestock is instituted. The logical next step in determining the real-world significance of this approach would be to conduct longitudinal studies to monitor zoophagic vector abundance within rural areas of Central America before and after the institution of endectocidal MDA of local livestock herds."
"9434572","Our long-term goal is to advance the knowledge of the neurobiological and molecular mechanisms underlying chronic pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) and develop effective pharmacologic treatments. Pain is not only a life-long companion but also a predictor of mortality for the 100,000 Americans living with SCD, people mainly of African or Latin descent.1-3 Pain and SCD are so intimately intertwined, that African tribal words for the disease, spoken hundreds of years before Herrick described SCD in the western literature, are onomatopoeic for pain. Though it is now appreciated that SCD pain is characterized by chronic pain with episodes of acute pain,4-5 the neurobiology of chronic pain is poorly studied, not well characterized, and is refractory to currently available therapies,6-7 a century after Herrick's seminal paper.8 A great deal of research has been carried on the disease itself.9-10 Several transgenic models of SCD have been developed, including the humanized Berkeley (BERK)11 and Townes' sickle cell transgenic mice (TOW),12 both representing SCD phenotypes that closely mimics many features of severe SCD in humans.13-20 We propose to employ these well-characterized sickle cell transgenic mouse models for studying molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying chronic pain, which can hold much promise for a more thorough understanding of pain mechanisms in SCD and may guide development of effective therapies. This R35 program will advance the knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying chronic pain in SCD and apply new knowledge to design and examine experimental therapeutics in mouse models of SCD. The program is designed to have flexibility that expanded or new research directions can be rapidly taken when new findings or emerging technology become available. Our research applies the power of molecular and cellular biology, pharmacology, neurobiology, epigenetics, targeted delivery, and other cutting-edge tools and we have existing research, expertise and research facility for studying sickle pain problem at molecular, cellular, and systems levels. This program will methodologically investigate chronic pain in SCD using several newly developed innovations and start to fill the void in our understanding of chronic pain of SCD. Having identified the CaMKII? target for SC pain and recently moved a CaMKII? inhibitor from bench to a Phase I study in patients with SCD, our team is uniquely suited to carry out research in this R35 program. Our innovation has a high probability of success given our outstanding track record, vibrant ongoing research program, and the designed flexibility in pursuing new research directions."
"9407291","Project Summary: Increasing amount of evidence indicate that hypothalamic AgRP neurons control energy homeostasis by co-releasing NPY, AgRP and GABA to some specific post-synaptic targets in the brain. Recent studies suggested that activation of AgRP neurons promotes weight gain by simultaneously stimulating food intake and suppressing energy expenditure. However, it remains elusive as of how AgRP neurons organize a neural circuit to suppress thermogenesis and reduce energy expenditure in response to nutritional signals. The objective of this proposal is to gain mechanistic insights into the functional connectivity and key signaling components of a novel AgRP circuit that exerts distinct control of energy expenditure. Here, we obtained compelling results indicating that a subpopulation of AgRP neurons exert unique control of intrascapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) thermogenesis by sending inhibitory projections to the ventral lateral part of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRd) in the midbrain. Our central hypothesis is that a subpopulation of AgRP neurons, in response to peripheral nutritional signals, play a distinct role in suppression of energy expenditure by inhibiting MC4R- expressing 5-HT neurons in the DRd. We will test the hypothesis in the following aims: Aim 1: Determine whether a subset of AgRP neurons that project to the DRd plays a physiological role in control of energy expenditure; Aim 2: Determine whether AgRP signaling mediates thermogenesis and energy metabolism by suppression of MC4R signaling system in the DRd; Aim 3: Determine whether serotonergic signaling in the DRd plays a crucial role in the regulation of AgRP neuron- mediated energy expenditure. Our proposed studies will reveal mechanistic insights underlying the control of thermogenesis and energy metabolism by a novel neural circuit. Taken together, the potential outcome of proposed study would facilitate the elucidation of a more complete neural network and underlying signaling pathways in distinct control of energy expenditure, one of the key prerequisites to future development of effective treatment for obesity."
"9448552","Abstract This project is focused on metabolic reprogramming in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC). ChRCC accounts for 5% of all sporadic renal cancers and can also occur in genetic syndromes including Birt-Hogg- Dube' (BHD) and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), both autosomal dominant disorders. There are currently no specific therapies for metastatic ChRCC, and life expectancy is estimated to be less favorable than for metastatic clear cell RCC, highlighting the potential clinical impact of this project Using metabolomic profiling of ChRCC compared with matched normal kidney, we have uncovered a striking decrease in intermediates of the gamma-glutamyl cycle, known as the glutathione salvage pathway. Consistent with this distinctive metabolic phenotype, we found that Gamma-glutamyl transferase 1 (GGT1), the key enzyme of this pathway, is expressed at >100-fold lower levels in ChRCC vs. normal kidney. Low GGT1 activity is predicted to result in lower utilization of exogenous glutathione, enhanced de novo glutathione synthesis, and increased oxidative stress. These and other data lead to our central hypothesis: metabolic reprogramming triggered by impairment of the glutathione salvage pathway is critical in the pathogenesis of ChRCC. A key translational corollary of this hypothesis is that ChRCC will be selectively sensitive to agents that inhibit glutathione biosynthesis and/or induce further oxidative stress. Aim 1. To determine the role of impairment of the glutathione salvage pathway in the pathogenesis and  therapy of ChRCC. Aim 2. To determine the therapeutic impact of targeting glutathione biosynthetic pathways in ChRCC in vitro  and in vivo. Aim 3. To identify molecular and metabolic determinants of the metastatic potential of ChRCC. If our hypotheses are correct, it will lead to a completely new pathogenic model for ChRCC, and to the identification of candidate therapeutic targets. Our long-term goal is to identify paradigm-shifting targeted therapeutic opportunities for patients with recurrent or metastatic ChRCC, for whom there are currently no proven therapeutic options."

"9447822","7. Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of this project is a preclinical trial of a potential new drug to treat heart failure (HF), dabuzalgron, a highly selective alpha-1A-adrenergic receptor (a1A-AR) partial agonist drug. Dabuzalgron is not approved for use in patients, but had no toxicity in Phase 2 trials for a different indication, so has a viable path to clinical use. HF is a major problem, but few new drugs have resulted from 30 years of basic research.  This project is based on the novel idea that cardiac myocyte a1A-ARs are an endogenous adaptive signaling system that protects and repairs myocytes after injury, via ERK activation. The catecholamines norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) activate two types of ARs on cardiac myocytes, the dominant beta- ARs, which increase heart contraction, and a1-ARs, which are few in number and studied much less. In HF, when NE and EPI are high, beta-AR stimulation can be damaging, so beta-AR-blockers are class I therapy. a1-ARs are relatively unoccupied in HF, and an exogenous a1A agonist can be therapeutic.  Indeed, 2 different selective a1A agonists, dabuzalgron and A61603, treat HF in several mouse models, via pleiotropic cellular and signaling mechanisms, including changes in hypertrophy, less myocyte death, improved metabolism, reduced fibrosis, and increased contractile proteins, via ERK as a central mechanism. The a1A-ERK mechanism is preserved in human myocardium. These beneficial effects are seen at dosing far below that which increases blood pressure, the recognized role of alpha-1-ARs.  This project will take several key steps toward translation. First, unlike A61603, dabuzalgron has been studied in patients, so the path to a clinical drug is feasible. Second, unlike A61603, dabuzalgron dosing is such that assay of drug levels at therapeutic dosing is possible. Third, dabuzalgron will be used in a mouse model of chronic post-MI HF, a type of HF that could be a first clinical trial in patients. Fourth, females will be studied, in addition to males. Finally, the project will test a novel mechanism of action for HF drugs, stimulating protective growth factors from myocytes, and/or from brown adipose tissue.  The overall hypothesis is that an alpha-1A agonist that has been used in patients can rescue cardiac function in a mouse model of chronic post-MI HF, and one mechanism is increased protective growth factors. There will be 2 aims, one translational and one more mechanistic.  Aim I: Test whether dabuzalgron can rescue cardiac function in a mouse model of post-MI HF.  Aim II: Test whether a1A agonism works by stimulating growth factors from cardiac myocytes and/or  brown adipocytes.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide preclinical validation of a potential novel HF drug with a unique mechanism of action as an agonist. This mechanism contrasts with current class I HF drugs, which are all antagonists, and which all have the therapy-limiting side effect of low blood pressure."
"9624843","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ?15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice."
"9455460","Project Summary The threat of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections has in recent years led to increased efforts in identifying novel antibacterials. These efforts have resulted in the approval of several new drug classes for Gram-positive infections; however due to the additional challenges imposed by the outer membrane found in Gram-negative bacteria, a novel broad-spectrum agent has not been introduced since 1968. Furthermore, the majority of compounds in the Gram-negative drug development pipeline are derivatives of existing antibiotics, which increases the likelihood of cross-resistance with approved treatments. Thus, there exists a critical need to identify novel classes of broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly those with activity against MDR pathogens. One class of antibacterials is the nybomycins, which are particularly promising due to their impressive activity against wild-type and MDR S. aureus and Enterococci species in both cell culture and animal models of infection. However their use as broad-spectrum agents is limited by their inability to penetrate into Gram- negative bacteria. It is, therefore, the objective of this application to expand the nybomycin spectrum of activity by designing derivatives that possess suitable activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. This work will build upon preliminary studies that recently identified the first nybomycin analogue with activity against Gram-negative bacteria. In Specific Aim 1, a collection of nybomycin derivatives will be prepared and evaluated for the ability to inhibit their biological target and accumulate in Gram-negative bacteria. The results from these studies will be used to determine how each of these factors contribute to antibacterial activity and guide the synthesis of more active derivatives. The therapeutic potential of these compounds will be determined in Specific Aim 2 by evaluating their tolerability, pharmacokinetic parameters, and in vivo efficacy in mice. The completion of these studies will have a significant impact on human health by providing a series of nybomycin analogues with significant activity against serious MDR Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens as well as the preliminary in vivo data to support their development as a novel drug class."
"9465333","Project Summary The goal of this project is to introduce a new microcatheter that will significantly improve an interventional radiologist?s ability to navigate across small blood vessels. Microcatheters are designed to reach small vascular targets from access points such as the femoral or radial arteries, located up to 150 cm away. Interventional radiologists use these devices to treat a wide variety of ailments, from a traumatic vessel rupture to a hepatoma. Access and navigation of small vessels, however, can be difficult in up to 45 % of all cases, where there is challenging anatomy or when multiple targets are present. Difficulties in navigation can result in added procedure time, unpredictable scheduling, increased radiation exposure, and, in time-critical processes such as a ruptured pseudoaneurysm, poorer clinical outcomes. In cases where navigation is challenging, the interventionalist can switch to microcatheters, guidewires, or guide catheters with different shapes or stiffness to help with vessel selection, but at additional cost and time. We have developed a microcatheter, the A1, using a novel coaxial design that allows active deflection of the microcatheter tip, while satisfying the size requirements for general microvascular and neurovascular procedures and preserving the tracking and torqueing properties of existing microcatheters. This would greatly enhance the operator?s ability to navigate the vasculature, and reduce the need to stock and use passive devices with different shapes. We have provided proof of concept on a model testbed and also in vivo. In Phase 1 of this proposal we will focus on refinement our microcatheter prototypes to achieve a design freeze. This requires the development of an anatomically-accurate vascular testbed that highlights the challenges encountered by the interventional radiologist and quantitative comparisons to commercially-available microcatheters devices that will define the performance milestones of the A1 microcatheter. In Phase 2 we will focus on in vitro design verification and in vivo design validation testing versus predicate devices for a 510k application. We intend to achieve 510k clearance within 2 years and first in-human use immediately afterwards."
"9573698","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebrovascular accumulation of the amyloid ß-protein (Aß), a condition known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is an important driver of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and is a common comorbidity of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). CAA can promote VCID through a number of mechanisms including chronic inflammation, hypoperfusion and ischemia, loss of vessel wall integrity and hemorrhage. In addition to its prevalence in AD, several related familial CAA disorders result from specific mutations that reside within the Aß peptide sequence of the Aß precursor protein including the Dutch-type (E22Q) and Iowa-type (D23N) mutations. Despite the highly fibrillogenic nature of Dutch mutant and Iowa mutant Aß peptides, fibrillar Aß is restricted to te cerebral vasculature in these familial disorders. Recent evidence suggests the cerebral vascular amyloid is distinct from parenchymal plaque amyloid. However, there is a poor understanding as to why cerebral vascular amyloid forms and its unique structural features that promotes distinct pathological consequences leading to VCID. Thus, the focus of this proposal is to fill this critica void in knowledge. Accordingly, the overall hypothesis of this proposal is that fibrillar amyloid i cerebral blood vessels possesses distinct structural features compared to parenchymal fibrillar amyloid and unique anti-parallel structures, enhanced by CAA mutations, drives the cerebral vascular specific deposition of amyloid in brain.  To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims. First, we will determine the structure, assembly and membrane interactions of wild-type and the Dutch and Iowa CAA mutants of Aß in solution and model membrane systems that drive their compartmental deposition. Second, we will determine how familial CAA variants of Aß chronologically influence the structural features and assembly of wild-type Aß in the brains of transgenic mice. Third, we will isolate parenchymal plaque amyloid and cerebral vascular amyloid from post mortem brain tissue of AD cases, sporadic CAA cases and familial CAA cases and investigate their ability to promote assembly of wild-type and CAA mutant Aß peptides. These important studies will reveal the distinct structural signatures of cerebral vascular and parenchymal plaque amyloid deposits in human disease.  Presently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapies specifically for CAA and VCID. These deficiencies are complicated by our lack of understanding of the unique structural attributes of cerebral vascular amyloid and its early-stage oligomeric precursors, and their distinctive features and processes compared to parenchymal plaque amyloid. The present proposal will seek to fill this critical void in our knowledge and will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of CAA and provide the basis for the future development of novel therapeutic interventions and diagnostic markers for CAA and VCID."
"9589779","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (OVERALL) We propose here to continue our work to create the world?s best community resource for the curation and dissemination of knowledge on genetic variations relevant to clinical care through the development of the Clinical Genome (ClinGen) Resource. ClinGen?s goals can be summarized by answering questions related to the evidence that variation in a gene causes disease (gene validity), specific variants within a disease gene are associated with disease (variant classification) and whether there is evidence for specific clinical actions if such variants are found (actionability). As part of the three grants submitting U41 applications, our team will have a particular focus on implementation of ClinGen processes for gene and variant curation across non-classic Mendelian disorders including hereditary cancer, somatic variation in cancer, pharmacogenomics and complex inheritance including non-coding variation in common disease. We are also proposing to further enrich the analysis of these variants across populations by the introduction of the ever increasing sequence and genotyping datasets from diverse populations. We will also explore the complex issues around reporting of ancestry in clinical genomics particularly as alleles in different settings may have different disease impact. During the first phase of ClinGen funding the Stanford/Baylor informatics and computational biology teams have built a number of curation interfaces for gene, variant and actionability curation. In this application we plan to expand the suite of online resources that seamlessly aggregates, normalizes and presents disparate sources of evidence to curators. Our goal is to enable consistent curation and improve the clinical application of genomic data in medicine through this informatics infrastructure. We will provide training for the community in the use of these tools by facilitating online learning courses, support of the clinical domain working groups and creation of helpdesks. The clinicalgenome.org online public portal will provide the outcome of these analyses for the community to utilize for clinical interpretation and development of clinical practice guidelines that are based on genetic results."
"9469722","Debilitating degenerative disorders like Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis cause progressive loss of adolescent and adult motor neurons. The ability to produce motor neurons in vitro from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells holds great promise for mechanistically understanding these diseases and testing drugs for treatment. However, motor neurons differentiated from stem cells using current methods fail to mature, molecularly resembling fetal rather than adult cells. This experimental limitation parallels a lack of understanding of motor neuron maturation in vivo, and prevents the in-depth study of neuronal function and dysfunction in adolescent and adult onset disorders.  The goal of this proposal is to define the transcriptional regulators of motor neuron maturation in vivo and to develop methods for programming adult motor neurons in vitro. Expression analyses demonstrate that neuronal maturation is accompanied by global changes in gene expression. In the proposed study, the regulatory logic of maturation-specific gene expression will first be defined by performing genomic analysis on aging mouse motor neurons. Specifically, the recently developed INTACT method will be used to purify embryonic, post-natal, and adult motor neuron nuclei in order to map active enhancers and gene expression. Motif analysis will then be performed at stage-specific enhancers, in combination with differential expression analysis, to computationally identify the transcription factors that regulate maturation. Next, the sufficiency of putative regulatory transcription factors to specify adult motor neurons will be tested in in vitro maturation assays. To do this, stem cell lines with stage-specific reporters will first be created to track maturation stage. These cells will be differentiated into immature motor neurons, expression of putative maturation-regulating transcription factors will be induced, and combinations of transcription factors that lead to the activation of maturation markers will be identified.  This approach will not only identify transcription factors that control mature motor neuron identity in vivo, but will also allow the manipulation of transcription factor expression in vitro to produce developmentally relevant, adult motor neurons from pluripotent cells. Overall, the proposed study will illuminate regulatory mechanisms that control maturation of spinal motor neurons, enable further mechanistic studies of neuronal maturation, and make it possible to appropriately model adolescent and adult onset degenerative disorders."
"9530983","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of HIV infection as a cause of human illness and death, and achieving zero HIV transmission have been embraced by the AIDS research and treatment communities as achievable. As HIV care and treatment programs are implemented throughout Africa, critical advances in research and policy are needed, so that care and treatment resources can be deployed to optimal benefit: decreasing both new HIV transmissions and HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Among the most important challenges to maximizing the public health benefits of HIV care and treatment programs are late diagnosis of HIV-infection, low rates of linkage to care, and high rates of late ART initiation which in turn ar associated with high rates of mortality, more costly clinical management and continued HIV transmission. In addition there remain unanswered clinical questions for persons living with HIV (PLWH) even with optimal ART. For PLWH in SubSaharan Africa (SSA), ART has been highly effective in decreasing HIV-related morbidity (and mortality), but the association of HIV with metabolic diseases and other conditions of aging (e.g. cancers), and the impact of under- or over-nutrition are not well defined. Newly funded as CA-IeDEA four years ago, we have built a new Central Africa IeDEA (CA- IeDEA), and have 1.) Compiled and managed secondary source patient-level data on ~52,000 patients through both extraction from existing electronic data and new on-the-ground systems for efficient capture of clinical data in low-resource clinical settings; 2.) Been highly productive scientifically with >20 publications even while data collection was in development, and 3.) have continued to foster African leadership and build local research capacity. We propose now to increase the database modestly (to ~80,000 patients) to increase the representativeness of HIV in the region geographically and in service delivery strategies and success and to expand our implementation science approaches to optimize short- and long-term HIV care outcomes both in Central Africa and globally, continue to investigate epidemiologic questions with clinical impact, with a focus on the comorbidities of aging and women's reproductive health."
"9527374","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Jones, Clinton, J PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Following infection of mice with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), neurons in brainstem and trigeminal ganglia (TG) are primary sites for latency. Reactivation from latency consistently occurs in these same anatomical sites following explant of tissue or heat shock induced stress. In contrast to productive infection, the latency associated transcript (LAT) is the only viral gene abundantly expressed in latently infected neurons. Recent studies demonstrated that ?-catenin and the ?-catenin coactivator, High-Mobility Group AT?Hook 1 protein (HMGA1) were detected in TG neurons of mice latently infected with HSV-1 but not TG neurons of uninfected mice. In contrast, the Wnt antagonist, dickopf 1 (DKK-1) protein, which has been reported to cause neuro-degeneration, was induced during explant-induced reactivation from latency. Expression of LAT in mouse neuroblastoma cells stabilized ?-catenin protein expression, which correlated with enhanced cell survival. Since the canonical Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway promotes neurogenesis and neuronal survival, we hypothesize that the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway cooperates with LAT to regulate the HSV- 1 latency-reactivation cycle. Studies in Specific Aim 1 will compare ?-catenin, HMGA1, and DKK-1 expression in brainstem and TG neurons during the latency-reactivation cycle following infection with a LAT null mutant virus or wild-type HSV-1. Small molecules that regulate the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway will also be examined for their effects on reactivation from latency. Studies in Specific Aim 2 will identify LAT functions important for mediating ?-catenin expression and examine how LAT and ?-catenin cooperate to interfere with apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells and mice. These studies will provide insight into the mechanism by which the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway regulates the HSV-1 latency-reactivation cycle. The HSV-1 latency-reactivation cycle is responsible for encephalitis, recurrent eye disease, including stromal keratitis, and genital lesions in humans. At this point, there are no HSV-1 vaccines or therapeutic strategies that specifically interfere with the reactivation from latency. Although LAT is an important regulator of the latency-reactivation cycle, cellular factors that regulate the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway may mediate crucial steps during the latency-reactivation cycle. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Recurrent herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infections occur because the virus can establish, maintain, and reactivate from latency. LAT is the only viral gene abundantly expressed in latently infected neurons. Studies in this proposal will examine the role that the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway cooperates with LAT to regulate the latency-reactivation cycle."
"9454823","Project Summary Project 1: Dynamic Host Responses During Resolution of HAP   Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the leading causes of death from nosocomial infections, with high rates of associated mortality. HAP due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. is substantially more difficult to treat than other pathogens, with clinical failure rates as high as 50%. These rates persist despite optimization of antibiotic regimens, suggesting factors beyond antibiotic resistance contribute. In this Project, we will examine the host response to pneumonia. We hypothesize that persistent inflammation in the alveolus after appropriate antibiotic treatment contributes to clinical failure in patients with P. aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp. pneumonia. We will test this hypothesis in three interrelated Specific Aims. Aim 1. To determine whether pathogen-associated changes in the transcriptomic signatures of alveolar macrophages and lymphocyte subsets over time predict outcome of severe pneumonia. Aim 2. To prospectively validate predictive host responses identified using an ecosystem-based modeling approach in a separate cohort of patients with severe pneumonia. Aim 3. To determine whether validated host responses predictive of clinical outcome are related to pneumonia endpoints in murine models. We will combine clinical data from the Electronic Health Record and integrate these clinical data with transcriptomic and epigenomic data obtained from flow sorted alveolar macrophages and Treg cells isolated from serial samples of NBBAL over the course of the patient's illness. Through the development of these predictive tools, the SCRIPT Systems Biology Center offers the potential to discover novel pathways that drive pneumonia pathobiology for therapeutic targeting, and the ability to revise understanding of pneumonia as a complex interaction between the host, pathogen, and microbiome.    "
"9451705","PROJECT SUMMARY  8.5 million people in the United States suffer from peripheral arterial disease (PAD). As the disease progresses, it can lead to severe obstruction of arterial blood flow to the extremities causing critical limb ischemia, and is associated with devastatingly high mortality rates of up to 20% just 6 months from initial diagnosis. This condition requires immediate endovascular treatment to re-establish blood flow, commonly through the use of stents, balloon angioplasty, or autologous vein grafts; however, these treatments require multiple interventions and do not conclusively lower the amputation rates. Therapeutic interventions aimed at long-term functional recovery must augmenting tissue angiogenesis concomitant with restoring physiological tissue architecture. This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award builds on previous work that demonstrates that spatial patterning cues from nanoscale extracellular matrices modulate endothelial cell (EC) morphology and angiogenic function. The objective of the current study is to use nanoscale cell guidance from aligned 3D scaffolds to enhance the angiogenic potential of vascular ECs, with the regenerative goal of restoring blood flow to ischemic regions and enabling functional repair of severely damaged tissue, an important public health goal that has been challenging to attain.  First, this award will provide the opportunity to examine the role of spatial patterning using aligned versus non-patterned scaffolds, in the enhancement of EC angiogenic function as well as the modulation of muscle myoblasts phenotype and mechanical properties. In parallel with this aim, the therapeutic efficacy of EC-seeded aligned scaffolds in comparison to non-patterned scaffolds, will be assessed for tissue revascularization and muscle regeneration in a mouse model of volumetric muscle and vascular injury. Through these studies, the challenge of restoring both vascular and muscular function to injured tissues is tackled on multiple fronts by using spatial cell patterning to induce an EC phenotype concomitant with angiogenesis that will in turn enhance muscle myofiber differentiation and maturation. Finally, to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which gene networks and pathways work in concert to promote angiogenesis through spatial patterning, methodologies in gene silencing and functional genomics will be employed to reveal novel cell patterning pathways. The proposed training will include courses offered through the Stanford School of Medicine and externships with leading experts in the fields of cardiovascular medicine, data science, and muscle regeneration. The proposed series of studies will deepen the understanding of the biological mechanisms through which spatial cell patterning confers enhancement of EC angiogenesis and muscle myoblast function. Findings from these studies will provide insights that will inform future regenerative strategies and engineered therapeutics for revascularization of severely damaged and ischemic tissues, and will serve as an innovative platform and important step in the treatment of a broad range of vascular diseases."
"9411759","Multiscale Predictive Modeling of Blood Cell Damage with Experimental Verification This proposal aims to develop a multiscale model to characterize blood cell damage under complex flow conditions. Blood damage is an important concern for various blood wetting medical devices. In literature, blood damage criterion is typically obtained through empirical fitting of experimental hemolysis data in a specific device, yet little is known about cellular scale process of blood cell damage which hinders the accurate evaluation of blood damage in a general medical device. The goal of this proposal is to study blood cell damage at molecular and cellular level using combined computational modeling and experimental approaches. Specifically, we will develop a multiscale model that links molecular scale pores formation to cell membrane damage and hemoglobin release. The multiscale computational modeling will be applied for the first time to study of cellular flow over various channel geometries and clinically relevant devices with consideration of both hydrodynamics and membrane damage dynamics. Specifically, we plan to: 1. Develop a multiscale red blood cell membrane damage model. A localized coarse-grained  molecular dynamics model at the high stress region will be concurrently linked with a network  based cellular membrane model. 2. Couple the cell membrane damage model with local fluid flow through Immersed Boundary  method to study cell deformation, pore formation and membrane rupture. Such computational  model will be applied to predict blood cell damages in a channels with different geometries  and flow conditions. A generalized cellular level blood cell damage model will be developed. 3. Verify the developed multiscale blood cell damage model using AFM measurements,  microfluidic tests, and Couette-type blood-shearing devices. A few designed tests will be  performed to evaluate cell damage based on hemoglobin analysis of individual cells under  controlled stress history and compared to the simulation results. Finally, the developed blood  damage model will be applied to study hemolysis in a ventricular assist device. The proposed multi-scale model can directly correlate the microscale state of the cell membrane to local stresses as well as predict cell damage in device with complex geometry and flow condition. Such model could serve as a predictive tool for hematologic biomedical device design and optimization."
"9403929","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The secretion of saliva is vitally important for oral health. The fluid provides hydration and lubrication to the oral cavity while the protein content contributes enzymes, which begin to digest food, and additional proteins which protect the oral cavity and upper gastrointestinal tract from bacterial and fungal infections. Given these important physiological functions, hypo-function of the salivary glands which is associated with the auto- immune disease, Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and as a result of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers results in a marked deterioration in quality of life; including difficulty swallowing and chewing food and a marked increase in dental carries and susceptibility to oral candidiasis. To develop therapy for dry-mouth it is fundamentally important to understand the processes that lead to saliva secretion physiologically and how these mechanisms are altered in pathological states. The overarching principle driving this proposal, is that a synergistic combination of experimental investigation and quantitative theoretical modelling can be used to further our understanding of both salivary gland physiology and pathology in a manner that neither single approach can accomplish. In the current proposal, a multi-scale model of fluid secretion will be developed from experimental data, which captures the essential spatial and temporal mechanistic features required for fluid flow at the molecular, cellular and glandular levels. The approach will use a process of iterative testing between model predictions and experimentally determined parameters and outcomes. The power of the approach is that the model can be used to quantitatively explain and interpret the experimentally derived data but also to suggest further experiments and subsequently to predict their outcomes. We will then adapt the model using data from SS patients and mouse models of disease to first, investigate the molecular mechanisms which underlies salivary hypo-function in SS and then use the model to predict and experimentally test, how salivary flow can be increased. Finally, we will adapt the model, again based faithfully on experimental data, to describe the reduction in salivary gland function that occurs following g-irradiation of salivary glands prior to loss of acinar tissue. It s envisioned that the model may ultimately suggest novel therapies to restore salivary gland function, which would not be readily evident from a traditional purely experimental methodologies."
"9610110","Project Summary/Abstract Protein lysine acetyltransferases are key enzymes in determination of cell fate though regulation of chromatin structure, gene expression, protein stability, and complex formation. The homologues p300 and CBP are perhaps the most renowned acetyltransferases due to their implication in a diversity of diseases including many developmental disorders and cancers. Although many deacetylase drugs have been developed, only very recently was the first acetyltransferase inhibitor patented, specifically for p300 and CBP. However little about this inhibitor's effects on genetic expression and the chromatin landscape is known. Coupled with recent data showing activation of p300/CBP nucleosome acetylation by an allosteric bromodomain ligand and concomitant significant inhibition of cellular proliferation, these ligands are primary tools to address the function and interplay between the ?writer? acetyltransferase domain and the adjacent ?reader? bromodomain. Previous and preliminary data corroborate the hypothesis of potential crosstalk between the domains. Therefore, the goals of the current proposal commencing in the K99 phase are to 1) Delineate the multifaceted regulation of the p300/CBP bromodomain and HAT domain in governing protein acetyltransferase function, specificity, and the genetic landscape using cellular drug co-treatment strategies and in vitro biochemistry; and 2) Identify novel protein substrates whose acetylation can be specifically modulated by p300/CBP ligand(s) by protein microarrays and characterize these acetylated substrates by expressed protein ligation followed by protein biochemistry/ molecular biology. Using the techniques and skills mastered in this phase, the R00 phase will apply these to the neglected yet unarguably pivotal MYST-family acetyltransferase MOZ. This will include 3) identifying the specific acetylation sites on nucleosomes and other protein substrates catalyzed by MOZ, and characterizing the function of these modification(s) on substrate protein function. The K99 training phase is transferred to Brigham and Women's Hospital. The trainee comes from a background in biochemistry and molecular biology. This training will build skills in pharmacology, chemical biology, and high-throughput epigenetic landscape analyses necessary to commence an independent career in epigenetic biochemistry. This includes but is not limited to post-translational modification site identification by mass spectrometry, expressed protein ligation, ChIP-Seq/RNA-Seq bioinformatics, and drug synergy studies. Courses in the respective disciplines will be audited. Professionally, the applicant will be taught strategies in academic laboratory leadership, mentoring and pedagogy. Upon completion of this training, the applicant will be more adequately equipped to commence on an academic research career focusing on the substrate selectivity and regulation of epigenetic enzymes. Members of the applicant's advisory committee will provide scientific and professional advice throughout all phases of the proposal."
"9413490","Abstract/Project Summary  The cerebellum is known to be a key part of the brain's sensory-motor processing. The basic features of cerebellar learning mechanisms are well characterized. This learning is the service of improving feed- forward predictions, which for much of the cerebellum contribute to the accuracy of movements. This proposal is about how the cerebellum copes with noisy inputs and is based on extensive preliminary data demonstrating a novel computation implemented by the cerebellum that makes its responses to noisy inputs more adaptive. We begin by training the cerebellum to output a response of a target size to a particular pattern of its mossy fiber inputs. By systematically varying the dissimilarity of probe mossy fiber inputs we see that the cerebellum does not decrease response amplitude as the dissimilarity increases. Doing so would be non-adaptive, as there is no prior experience that these smaller amplitudes are correct. Instead, the cerebellum decreases the likelihood of making a response as the dissimilarity increases, but when it does respond it almost always produces the correct amplitude. We present abundant preliminary data that this adaptive behavior is not attributable to the response system being inherently all-or-none. The same data demonstrate that this computation is cerebellar and is, indeed, largely accomplished in the cerebellar cortex. The responses of Purkinje cells, the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, are also all-or-none and track the behavior on a trial-by- trial basis. In three specific aims, we propose to identify the mechanisms of this adaptive computation. We will first complete recording studies that identify over a wide range of conditions the relative contributions of processing in the cerebellar cortex versus processing in the cerebellar deep nuclei. Second, we will use recordings from cerebellar cortex neurons to determine the mechanisms that make responding to uncertain inputs stochastic. In particular, we will determine whether there are significant differences in inputs to the Purkinje cells on response versus non-response trials and we will determine whether newly discovered connectivity between Purkinje cells and basket cells play a role in amplifying or thresholding these differences to make responding stochastic. Finally, we will use a combination of reversible inactivation techniques and recordings of Purkinje cells to test the hypothesis that newly discovered collaterals of deep cerebellar nucleus neurons implement a form of efference copy feedback that enforce the proper response amplitude even for inputs that are so different that they rarely elicit a response. Completion of these studies will identify the mechanisms of a novel computational adaptation of the cerebellum related to coping with noisy or uncertain inputs. Such mechanisms may be an under-appreciated category of etiology of neural pathologies, owing largely to the fact that most experimental approaches seek to eliminate as much noise or variability as possible. As such, these studies represent a novel and innovative approach to the mechanisms of brain function and dysfunction."

"9397297","Project Summary Healthcare spending in the United States is distributed unevenly, with approximately 50% of expenses incurred by 5% of the population.2,3 Managing the care of these high-cost patients is of key concern to health systems. However, few programs aimed at addressing the needs of high-cost patients have demonstrated net cost savings.4 Evidence suggests that the only successful programs are ones that closely align care management interventions with the specific needs of a given patient.6 Programs that target high-cost patients rely on several methods in order to identify patients needing intervention, including risk prediction algorithms, chronic disease criteria or utilization thresholds. Such approaches depend on the use of single variables, or combinations of variables, to identify high-cost patients, thereby assuming homogeneity among high-cost patients. By using growth mixture models (GMM), we will be able to characterize the heterogeneity among high cost patients in terms of a finite number of latent growth classes. Inclusion of auxiliary information (covariates and distal outcomes) in the GMM will be necessary in order to understand and evaluate the fidelity and utility of the resultant trajectory profiles. A result of this study will be the classification of high-cost patients into subgroups based on their cost and utilization trajectories and relevant medical, psychological, behavioral, and social factors. The identification of these subgroups represents an opportunity for care management programs to more effectively align services to the meet the needs of the many types of patients they serve, which may lead to better health outcomes and reductions in utilization of acute care services and costs."
"9320182","Project Summary/Abstract: RNAs play diverse roles in biology, but our ability to fully understand their cellular roles is limited by the lack of tools to study and manipulate RNA. Non-coding RNAs have emerged as key regulators in cellular biology and include both small interfering RNAs and micro-RNAs that regulate mRNA expression through Argonaute- dependent RNA-degradation and thousands of long-intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), which generally serve to modulate gene expression, epigenetic states, and post-transcriptional processes. The mammalian genome encodes tens of thousands of lincRNAs and while they have diverse regulatory roles in gene expression, especially in both the positive and negative directions in cancer, it is unknown whether lincRNAs play a significant role in cancer resistance. Although remarkable clinical effects are seen with the BRAF- inhibitor vemurafenib in melanoma, they nevertheless fail due to drug resistance. Genome-wide gain- and loss- of-function pooled screening have revealed many of the genes involved in vemurafenib resistance using in vitro cell line models of melanoma, but the role of lincRNAs in melanoma resistance is still unclear. While many RNA-targeting tools exist to study these processes, none are ideal. For instance, siRNAs suffer from poor specificity and are incapable of targeting nuclear RNAs, such as lincRNAs. Recently, we computationally discovered novel CRISPR-associated enzymes and identified a new family, C2c2, which had significant conservation of two HEPN endoribonuclease domains, suggesting the likely ability for C2c2 to cleave RNAs. I will combine biochemical and bacterial genetic techniques to functionally characterize C2c2, engineer the enzyme for mammalian applications, and use this tool for the interrogation of non-coding RNA mediators of resistance in melanoma.  In Aim 1, I will biochemically characterize C2c2 from Leptotrichia shahii and identify the key active residues for RNA cleavage. Validation of reprogrammable RNA targeting will be demonstrated both in vitro using purified protein and in vivo using E. coli. In Aim 2, I will screen 12 C2c2 orthologs to determine the most active RNA-targeting enzyme. I will then express human codon-optimized versions of the top orthologs in mammalian cells to demonstrate endogenous RNA cleavage and perform whole-transcriptome RNA- sequencing to evaluate the specificity of C2c2. In Aim 3, I will develop a genome-wide lincRNA library of C2c2 crRNAs and perform a knockdown screen in a melanoma cell line subjected to BRAF-inhibitor drug selection. I will validate the hits and demonstrate that they are capable of modulating sensitivity to BRAF-inhibitors.  This project will develop a reprogrammable RNA-targeting tool and investigate the roles of non-coding RNAs in melanoma resistance. The availability of RNA-targeting tool is useful for many applications and the understanding of non-coding interactions in melanoma resistance is essential for developing better therapies."
"9475973","ABSTRACT Effective HIV treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) has shifted the spectrum of morbidity and mortality to non-infectious complications such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). To date HIV-CVD research has largely been conducted in western countries where atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD) is the predominant pathology. However, nearly 80% of the global CVD burden exists in developing nations and 70% of the global HIV epidemic exists in sub-Saharan Africa, where hypertension and non-CHD related heart failure (HF) are the predominant CVD pathologies. Our central hypothesis is that sub-Saharan Africans with HIV infection are at increased risk for HF despite ART. This risk is mediated, in part, via structural changes to the myocardium characterized by end-organ inflammation and fibrosis. This biology is exacerbated by advancing age, may be accelerated by hypertension, and occurs in the absence of atherosclerotic ischemic CHD. Prior to advancing CVD prevention strategies in sub-Saharan Africa, we will use this R21 exploratory proposal to characterize the independent effects of treated HIV disease and advancing age on structural changes to myocardium. We will also explore the potential underlying mechanisms with an emphasis on the contribution of monocyte subsets reflecting greater inflammation and migration that potentiate pro-fibrotic M2 tissue macrophages. The unique CVD risk factor profile in sub-Saharan Africa will influence this biology, and limits the generalizability of data from high-income countries. We propose to evaluate myocardial changes by HIV status and age, by studying 4 groups of participants (n=50 in each): a) HIV+ on ART age ?50, b) HIV+ on ART age <50, c) HIV- age ?50, and d) HIV- age<50. We will exclude those with known CHD, structural heart disease, TB, or opportunistic infections. Participants will have comprehensive assessments of myocardial structure and function (and coronary ischemic disease) via cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, as well as vascular stiffness and immunologic studies. We hypothesize that ART-treated HIV+ persons will have increased myocardial fibrosis (diffuse), tissue inflammation and diastolic dysfunction, and the adverse effects of HIV infection and older age (e.g., age >50 years old) on myocardial structure and dysfunction will be additive. Potential mechanisms that may, in part, mediate the effect of HIV status and/or age on myocardial abnormalities include arterial stiffness, systemic inflammation and an expansion of monocyte phenotypes indicative of a shift toward M2 pro-fibrotic tissue macrophages. In sum, our findings will inform a possible paradigm shift in our understanding of HIV-CVD complications and guide research to improve the quality of life for older HIV+ patients in sub-Saharan Africa."
"9616453","PROJECT DESCRIPTION  Tobacco use remains a major public health and economic concern, particularly in women who are more vulnerable to the long-term health consequences of smoking than men. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then reducing tobacco use and developing specialized medications for female smokers will remain largely incomprehensible. The long-term goal of our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate tobacco use among different clinical populations that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this proposal is to determine the neural mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. The central hypothesis of this application is that females are more susceptible to tobacco use than males because of stronger rewarding effects of nicotine and heightened anxiety produced by withdrawal from this drug. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that estradiol (E2) promotes the rewarding effects of nicotine and magnifies the stress produced by nicotine withdrawal in females. More specifically, we postulate that sex differences in response to nicotine are modulated within the neural circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), where dopamine is increased following nicotine administration and decreased during withdrawal from this drug. Thus, females experience greater rewarding effects of nicotine in the presence of E2, which promotes dopamine release in the NAcc. Following repeated nicotine exposure, opponent processes develop to counteract the chronic over-activation of dopamine release. We suggest that the emergence of these opponent processes is evident during withdrawal from chronic nicotine as an increase in the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the NAcc. This increase in CRF levels enhances the inhibitory tone in the NAcc, which results in a decrease in dopamine release during nicotine withdrawal. Thus, females experience greater anxiety during nicotine withdrawal in the presence of E2, which promotes the recruitment of opponent stress systems that suppress dopamine release in the NAcc. The proposed studies reflect a multi- disciplinary approach involving neurochemical, behavioral, and gene transfer techniques to compare sex differences in the rewarding effects of nicotine (Aim 1) and the aversive states produced by withdrawal (Aim 2) because both of these factors are believed to promote tobacco use in females. The approach to studying sex differences involves comparisons of male, female, and OVX female rats. If the removal of ovarian hormones reverses the proposed measures in females, then the role of E2 will be assessed in OVX rats that will receive E2 supplementation and will be tested following E2 or vehicle administration. At the completion of this project, our findings will help us develop a unifying hypothesis regarding the factors that promote tobacco use in females. This exemplifies the significance of this research because a better understanding of the mechanisms that fuel tobacco use in females will lead to more effective treatments to reduce health disparities in women."
"9465189","PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this SBIR Phase I application is to select an optimized lead analog of ?-conotoxin RgIA to develop as a unique, non-opioid therapeutic for chronic neuropathic pain. RgIA, a peptide derived from the predatory marine cone snail Conus regius, is an inhibitor of the ?9?10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a novel genetically validated pain target. Our current lead candidate, KCP-400, potently and selectively inhibits both the rat and human target and displays analgesic efficacy in animal models of neuropathic pain. Moreover, RgIA and its analogs have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, thereby providing a neuropathic pain management strategy that includes both symptom reduction and disease modification. KCP-400 provides a novel, non-opioid mechanism of action that is distinct from all other commercially available products for the treatment of pain. Here, we propose to further optimize KCP-400 to increase its stability and bioavailability and enhance its therapeutic potential. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to: 1) optimize KCP-400 to increase its bioavailability while maintaining its target specificity; and 2) evaluate the efficacy and safety of the optimized KCP-400 in a nerve injury model of neuropathic pain. Peptide modifications to increase stability will include substitution of disulfide bridges with a stable backbone cross linker and peptide lipidation and pegylation. Analgesic potency of optimized KCP-400 will be evaluated through dose-response and comparative efficacy studies using the rat chronic constriction injury model of sciatic nerve injury and neuropathic pain. This work will provide an optimized preclinical development candidate for investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies during SBIR Phase II. The significance of the program is its emphasis on an analgesic product with reduced susceptibility to analgesic tolerance and drug abuse and anticipated significant impact on reducing the global burden of neuropathic pain. Innovation relates to the focus on a stable ?-conotoxin RgIA analog with high potency and specificity for a new molecular target and disease- modifying neuroprotective activity. The key deliverable of this project is an optimized, long-acting, non-opioid analgesic drug candidate with good safety, tolerability, and efficacy in animal models of neuropathic pain."
"9455305","Project Summary Malaria remains a significant global health problem that would greatly benefit from the development of a vaccine. Protection against clinical disease could be achieved by eliciting a protective immune response against the blood stage of the malaria parasite. However, only a very limited number of vaccine candidates are currently being studied. One approach to uncover novel potential vaccine targets is to analyze protective anti- malaria immunity in response to natural infection. Natural Plasmodium falciparum infections induce antibody responses that target the blood stage of this parasite. With repeated exposures, these responses accumulate to a level that protects against symptomatic disease. While dissection of the antibody specificities responsible for disease protection has taught us much about protective B-cell immunity, a large fraction of potential B-cell antigens has thus far remained unexplored. In this project, I propose to develop an unbiased platform to isolate antibodies that interfere with parasite replication during the malaria blood stage. In specific Aim 1, I will select individuals living in malaria-endemic regions who have developed protective immunity against the parasite and screen their serum for the capacity to bind to merozoites. A subset of individuals with serum reactivity against diverse parasite isolates will be selected for further study. In specific Aim 2, memory B cells will be isolated from these subjects and will be individually cultured to produce antibodies. These monoclonal antibodies will be screened for the ability to bind merozoites and induce opsonic phagocytosis. In specific Aim 3, antibodies with strong anti-parasite activity will be cloned and expressed as human IgG for further characterization. In a follow-up study, these antibodies can be used for the identification of novel vaccine antigens. This antibody discovery platform is designed to identify the types of antibodies that should be elicited by a protective vaccine: antibodies with broad and potent anti-malaria activity. The methodology developed in this project is uniquely based on screening of antibodies in functional assays and is thus fundamentally different from alternative methods for dissecting B-cell immunity that have thus far been used in the field. This approach therefore has the potential to discover novel antibodies and antibody specificities. Ultimately, the results of this project will provide much-needed insight into protective anti-malaria immunity and will accelerate vaccine design. !"
"9447753","Abstract Epidemiological studies provide mounting evidence supporting that environmental and experiential influences, such as stressful life events, interact with genetic variations and compound the risks for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD afflicts about 6.7% of the United States adults, but treatment options for MDD are limited and not effective. The objective of this proposal is to define the global epigenetic landscape associated with stress experience and assess the effect of locus-specific epigenetic changes on the manifestation of depression-like phenotypes. We propose to first expose both male and female mice to chronic unpredictable stress paradigms. We will then take a genomic approach to identify the stress responsive epigenetic code in targeted neuronal cell types in the brain. Finally, we will modify and apply CRISPR/Cas9 technology to address the causal relationship between the identified epigenetic code to the expression of depression-like behaviors. With currently available state-of-the-art technologies and our newly developed, genetically modified mouse tools, we hope to gain an insight into the epigenetic mechanisms through which stress interacts with susceptibility genes and confers increased risk to MDD. Our proposed study will also allow greater understanding of the underlying causes of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders and provide the necessary foundation for improved diagnosis and intervention."

"9419170","PROJECT SUMMARY Ovarian cancer affects tens of thousands of women each year, many of whom do not show symptoms until the disease has advanced significantly. With an increased challenge in treating patients exhibiting resistance to chemotherapeutics, targeted siRNA therapy offers great promise as a complementary or standalone treatment. Unfortunately, while RNA interference has been studied for at least 15 years, there are still no FDA approved vehicles for siRNA. Amongst the liposomes, micelles, cationic polymers, and other vectors currently being investigated, issues related to toxicity, specificity, and stability are all too common. Cationic polymers synthesized with precise lengths, sequences, tacticity, and chirality would offer an improvement of the status quo by being able to control structure with atomistic precision from the ?bottom up?. Structurally precise polymers, though ubiquitous in Nature, still remain as synthetic challenges for organic chemists. While Nature creates polypeptides to catalyze specific transformations and polynucleotides to store genetic information, both from a small catalog of building blocks, there is still a need to develop biomimetic syntheses of structurally precise artificial polymers. Iterative exponential growth (IEG) techniques have been known since the 1980?s and allow for highly efficient coupling between two monomers/oligomers, doubling the chain length after each iteration. While such methods have produced numerous examples of uniform high molecular weight (MW) oligomers with high degrees of polymerization, their applications for sequence-controlled synthesis have been scarce due to limitations in incorporating functionality. Recent advances have allowed for the introduction of functionalized chiral side-chains into the IEG platform (IEG+) to synthesize high MW (~ 6.5 kDa) oligotriazoles, providing a unique avenue to explore novel ?unimacromolecular? structure-function relationships. The IEG+ methodology represents a landmark in molecular architecture that combines efficient reactions (CuAAC) to access high MW structrues, highly soluble products, and complete control of backbone stereochemistry/sequence. As a consequence of the high yielding CuAAC reactions, triazoles are available for post-polymerization alkylation. In this work, IEG+ methodology will be exploited to synthesize and characterize 24 triazolium-containing polymers, all with precise lengths, sequences, tacticity, and chirality. It is expected that the diffuse nature of the positive charge throughout the heterocycle will confer decreased toxicity compared to traditional ammonium-based delivery agents. Upon evaluating these structures? affinity for ID4 siRNA, complexation will be correlated with the identity of each polymer. These data will then be utilized for the in vitro delivery to OVCAR8 cells and the in vivo treatment of subcutaneous xenograft tumor-bearing female mice. While chirality is expected to play a major role in binding helical siRNA, our ability to precisely tune so many additional structural parameters will provide great insight to the design principles that govern the development of siRNA nanotherapeutics for the treatment of ovarian cancer."
"9481195","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Attention impairment is ubiquitous in TBI survivors. This is a devastating impairment because attention is the backbone of cognitive systems. Attention is requisite for other cognitive processes that are vital to everyday functioning such as memory, problem solving, language skills, and the cognitive control of behavior. Studies of attention training have shown improved attention on laboratory measures, but limited translation to real-world tasks2. Notably, these previously-tested rehabilitation approaches have not included training in the very cogni- tive processes needed for translation of training to everyday tasks which include internal verbalization and self- monitoring, also called metacognitive strategies 3, 4. One training method for metacognitive strategies has shown promise 5, 6, but is lacking in basic attention training. Rehabilitation specialists have recently argued for a rehabilitation approach wherein both basic foundational attention and metacognitive strategies should be synergistically combined 7. Consequently, we will test an innovative combination of direct-attention training and metacognitive training for which the other compensates disadvantages of each. Because of the promise of each type of training separately, and the potential additive effects of the combination, it is critical to test this combined attention and metacognitive training in Veteran survivors of chronic moderate-to-severe TBI (m/sTBI). We will address the following two specific aims: We propose to conduct a pilot study to examine CRT effects in a group of Veterans with chronic m/sTBI, focused on remediating attention-control impairments using both direct-attention and metacognitive-strategy training approaches in a AB/BA crossover design with 1- month follow-up to address the following two specific aims: 1) Test treatment response to combined direct- attention and metacognitive-strategy training in Veterans with chronic m/sTBI; and 2) identify mechanisms and biomarkers of rehabilitation-related neuroplasticity. Under the first aim we will test for effects of combined di- rect-attention and metacognitive-strategy trainig on measures of complex functional activities and neurocogni- tive tests of attention-control functions. Under the second aim, we will test effects of our CRT approach on be- havioral and brain activity while participants perform a well-validated attentional task that probes the functio of three dissociable attentional systems. The approach is innovative because it combines a theoretically motivat- ed and novel approach to address a significant source of disability in Veteran survivors of TBI. The proposed research is significant because findings will form the foundation for a larger-scale trial to enable us to deter- mine the durability of gains and the functional impact of treatment on Veteran's real world activities and to more positively shape healthcare for our Veterans who are suffering from TBI."
"9404251","Project Summary/Abstract Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) affect millions of people and burdens society with large socioeconomic costs. Despite the socioeconomic and health impact of alcohol dependence, there are only three treatments currently approved for AUDs, which are only modestly effective. Currently, the molecular mechanisms contributing to neuroadaptive changes that result in alcohol tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal are not fully understood. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from controlled drinking to alcohol dependence is crucial in order to identify novel drug targets to advance the treatment of AUDs. Recent evidence suggests that alcohol dysregulates pro-inflammatory toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in the brain. Pharmacological or genetic manipulation of the TLR signaling pathway reduces alcohol intake and preference?suggesting that neuroimmune signaling could be an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of AUDs. Therefore, the proposed research will investigate the molecular mechanisms of an unexplored branch of the TLR signaling pathway (TRIF-dependent) and its role in alcohol abuse. The first aim will use mass spectrometry and phosphoproteomics to determine how alcohol alters neuroimmune kinase activity as well as the global kinome in brain. The second and third aim will use null mutants, viral-mediated gene manipulation and mouse behavioral models to test the functional role of TRIF-dependent signaling in regulation of ethanol consumption. Thus, the proposed studies were designed to investigate TRIF-dependent signaling as an untapped source of new targets for drug development and genetic study. This study will provide crucial new knowledge about an unexplored neuroimmune pathway and its role in alcohol addiction. Results from Aim 1 will determine global kinase dysregulation in alcohol use disorder that will facilitate development of new pharmacological targets. This study will also determine which signaling components of the TRIF-dependent neuroimmune signaling pathway are critical for regulation of ethanol consumption. By understanding how TRIF-dependent signaling can facilitate decreased alcohol consumption, results from this project will implicate interesting new pharmacological targets and facilitate the discovery of novel genes and pathways that might contribute to the initiation, maintenance, or progression of alcoholism. Furthermore, the results of this research may extend to other addictions and diseases that involve kinase dysregulation and neuroimmune signaling, such as ischemia, Alzheimer's Disease, Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury. Thus, understanding common signaling pathways provides an opportunity for developing therapeutic agents that will work in the treatment of multiple conditions, thereby increasing the quality of life for individual patients.  "
"9436296","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), which has been associated with up to 80% mortality, is considered ?virtually untreatable? in many parts of the world, and is threatening global TB control. Patients with any form of DR-TB have a much greater risk of dying than those with drug susceptible TB; resistance to second-line anti-TB drugs increases this risk more than fourfold, and treatment success rates can be as low as 30%. We have developed an optimized Targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NextGen-RDST) DST which can be performed directly from sputum samples. Pilot data of Version 1 of this test indicates it has excellent performance to detect MDR-TB (sensitivity of 97.6%, specificity of 98.9%) and XDR-TB (sensitivity of 90.0%, specificity of 97.8%). The goal of this project is to leverage well-characterized clinical sputum samples that were prospectively collected from an existing NIH project examining patients at risk for MDR-TB (R01AI111435, PI Rodwell) to verify the performance of our optimized NextGen-RDST.  There is currently no FDA approved rapid diagnostic for XDR-TB, which is why the 2013 CDC fact sheet states that diagnosis of XDR-TB (a NIAID Category C priority pathogen) currently requires ?6 to 16 weeks? to complete. There is a clear and critical need for an integrated, table-top platform for high sensitivity, high specificity, rapid diagnosis of drug resistant TB directly from patient samples. We propose to combine the experience, resources and existing diagnostic testing pipeline of the Global Consortium for Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Diagnostics (NIAID U01AI082229 and NIAID R01AI111435) with our project partner, Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) to further develop our optimized NextGen-RDST as a rapid XDR-TB diagnostic platform. Based on our extensive experience with the genetic basis of XDR-TB, and TGen's prototype platform for identifying specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) directly from clinical samples, we hypothesize that we will be able to detect XDR-TB isolates with clinically relevant phenotypic resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, fluoroquinolones and injectable anti-TB drugs with 90-98% sensitivity and ~100% specificity, and that discordances between a phenotypic standard and NextGen-RDST can be appropriately resolved through further genomic experimentation. We will achieve this goal by completing the following three objectives; (1) determining the sensitivity and specificity of our novel direct NextGen-RDST relative to reference standard phenotypic DST from cultures of the same sputa, collected from 500 patients at risk for MDR-TB in Moldova; (2) establishing the role that a culture step plays in the discordance between reference standards and novel NextGen-RDST; (3) determining the role subpopulations have in the discordance between the reference standards and the novel NextGen-RDST."
"9447085","PROJECT SUMMARY For several decades, clinical outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation have been limited by the availability of donor-matched sources of HSCs. This has motivated global improvements in donor recruitment and matching, as well as aggressive pursuit of new strategies for development of patient-derived or universally compatible hematopoietic cells. Attempts to specify human HSCs have only produced progenitors with limited lineage and engraftment potential using co-culture and expression of hematopoietic genes through modified RNAs or viral integration. Our studies show that biomechanical force caused by flow of blood through the vasculature is a critical regulator of hematopoiesis and can promote engraftment of cells with long-term hematopoietic reconstitution potential. A number of well-characterized pathways are activated by fluid shear stress in adult vascular endothelial cells, yet little is known about signaling within hemogenic endothelial cells and their precursors in embryogenesis. Our preliminary data strongly implicates initiation of blood flow as a critical determinant of energy metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics in the HSC precursor known as the hemogenic endothelium. The objective of our research is to define signaling mechanisms triggered by biomechanical force that promote definitive hematopoiesis, with the long-term goal of exploiting biophysical cues such as shear stress in directed differentiation and expansion of customized HSCs for therapeutic transplant and blood disease modeling. Specifically, we aim to identify mitochondrial adaptations induced by vascular force that promote expansion of hemogenic endothelium via utilization of reporter mouse models of HSC emergence and mitochondrial dynamics. We will identify mitochondrial features that contribute to fate selection and survival of cells with HSC potential using murine embryos and differentiation cultures of pluripotent stem cells. We will interrogate and define the intracellular signaling that drives mitochondrial remodeling in response to physiologic intensities of fluid force in hemogenic endothelium by pharmacological and genetic targeting. Further, consequences of disrupted or enhanced mitochondrial capacity will be defined during hemogenic endothelial cell fate selection and into adulthood to reveal how mitochondrial dynamics impact the hematopoietic program at its earliest stages within the vasculature. The proposed study promises to fill a major gap in our knowledge of how newly specified HSCs and their precursors produce energy and manage metabolic processes, and will provide insight into novel methods for engineering competitive self-renewing HSCs through manipulation of metabolism."
"9432059","ABSTRACT: The proposal in this application outlines a five-year training program for the development of a career as a physician-scientist in cardiopulmonary biology. The candidate is an Instructor of Pediatrics and a pediatric cardiologist at the Children?s Hospital of Philadelphia. The proposed research will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. Edward E. Morrisey, Ph.D., a leader in the field of cardiopulmonary development. Dr. Morrisey has trained numerous young investigators including several physician-scientists who currently hold academic appointments. An advisory committee has been assembled to provide expertise in pulmonary and cardiovascular biology in addition to career guidance from well-established to newly appointed independent investigators. The research environment has been carefully selected to include exposure to two institutions allowing access to extensive resources, core facilities, and intellectual guidance. In addition, the candidate will be participating in didactic courses and numerous professional development seminars to help ensure adequate training for independence. Together, this provides a unique and ideal environment for the candidate to develop the skills to transition to an independent physician-scientist in the cardiopulmonary field. I have identified a subpopulation of Wnt signaling-responsive type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AT2s), called Axin2+ AT2s or AT2sAxin2, which exhibit enhanced stem cell characteristics during alveologenesis (Frank DB et al. Cell Reports. 2016 Nov 22;17(9):2312-2325). In addition, the transcriptome of Axin2 AT2s are highly enriched for genes that are essential for vascular development and extracellular matrix production and interactions. The goal of this proposal is to not only further characterize this progenitor cell population in the alveolus but also examine the mechanism by which it orchestrates alveolar epithelial and endothelial growth during generation and regeneration of the alveolus. Therefore, the proposal will address these processes with two overriding aims: 1) Examine the regulation of alveolar epithelial cell self-renewal by Wnt ligand secretion; and 2) Identify and delineate the role of Wnt signaling and Wnt signaling-responsive alveolar progenitor cell populations in the epithelial-vascular niche of the developing and regenerating alveolus. ! The training program and research proposed in this application will provide critical tools, skills, and scientific expertise to become a physician-scientist in the pediatric cardiopulmonary field, a relatively understudied and underfunded area of pediatric research. There is no cure for pediatric PH and developmental lung diseases such as BPD. Thus, the identification and characterization of alveolar epithelial progenitor or stem cells could provide novel targets for therapy and lung growth."
"9444266","PROJECT(SUMMARY/ABSTRACT! Colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with the deaths of over 50,000 adult Americans annually. In the previous award period, we showed that in addition to genetic mutation, disease progression is accompanied by epigenetic changes at gene enhancer elements that switch genes on and off. We term these Variant Enhancer Loci, or VELs. Remarkably, colon tumors from different individuals show a common pattern of enhancers that are recurrently activated across patient samples. These recurrently activated enhancers constitute a signature of CRC. In this competing renewal application, we will investigate three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to uncover the mechanism by which these signature VELs form in CRC. Specific Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that the VELs are a direct consequence of mutations in canonical CRC oncogenes and tumor suppressors. This hypothesis will be tested through H3K27ac ChIP-seq analysis of the enhancer epigenome in human intestinal organoids in which each of known CRC driver genes were sequentially mutated via CRISPR/Cas9 to recapitulate the adenoma- carcinoma sequence predicted by the Vogelgram. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that transcription factors drive formation of the signature VELs. This hypothesis will be tested through knockdown and overexpression of transcription factors that bind to the signature VELs in CRC cell lines and intestinal organoid models, followed by analysis of chromatin at CRC signature VELs. Specific Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that somatic indel mutations in enhancer elements drive VEL formation. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategies will be used to correct or introduce candidate enhancer-creating indel mutations in CRC cell lines, followed by functional analysis of enhancer activity. Lastly, we propose a fourth Aim to assess whether VELs are required for tumorigenicity of CRC. CRISPR-Cas9-based strategies will be used to disrupt signature VELs in CRC cell lines, followed by quantification of their growth in mouse xenografts relative to unedited control cells. We expect to gain fundamental insights to epigenetic enhancer dysregulation as a root cause of CRC tumorigenesis that could lay the foundation for targeted therapies for patients. !"
"9500803","PROJECT SUMMARY:  Our lab recently co-discovered the COPA syndrome, an autoimmune disease caused by dominant mutations in the Coatomer subunit alpha (COPA) gene that manifests as inflammatory arthritis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). COPA encodes the COPA subunit of coat protein complex I (COPI). COPI is engaged in the retrograde movement of proteins from the Golgi to the ER and is a vital component of a cell's trafficking machinery. Patients with the COPA syndrome develop high-titer antinuclear or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies, immune-mediated kidney disease and an increase in CD4+ T helper 17 (Th17) cells, an immune cell subset implicated in autoimmunity. Some patients have findings consistent with rheumatoid arthritis RA including rheumatoid factors or autoantibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides. All COPA syndrome patients eventually develop interstitial lung disease (ILD) in combination with their arthritis. Generalized immunosuppressive drugs such as mycophenolate have been used to treat patients with limited success, although the ILD typically progresses on treatment and leads to end stage lung fibrosis.  We generated a germline point mutant knock-in mouse bearing the exact same E241K mutation as COPA syndrome patients. Preliminary data demonstrates that CopaE241K/+ mice spontaneously develop mononuclear lung infiltrates and an examination of peripheral lymphoid tissues reveals a significant increase in effector memory T cells. Detailed study of developing thymocytes shows a significant increase in mature CD8+ and CD4+ single positive (SP) cell populations, findings that suggest alterations in thymocyte development or selection. CopaE241K/+ mice bred to a T cell receptor transgenic mouse system revealed a defect in the negative selection of CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, reciprocal bone marrow chimera experiments map the selection defect to E241K COPA expression in the thymic stroma. Thus, we hypothesize that a critical precursor to autoimmune disease in the COPA syndrome is aberrant thymocyte selection caused by mutant COPA expression in the thymic epithelium. We propose to pursue this hypothesis by 1) Determining the role of mutant COPA in positive and negative selection of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 2) Defining the role of the thymic stroma on thymocyte development in CopaE241K/+ mice and 3) Defining the autoimmune features of CopaE241K/+ mice and COPA syndrome subjects.  Through our study we seek to determine the role of thymic tolerance in the pathophysiology of the COPA syndrome and establish CopaE241K/+ mice as a preclinical model for the disease. Because the COPA syndrome shares features with other inflammatory joint disorders, our study may provide novel insight into how impaired vesicular trafficking contributes to the pathogenesis of arthritis and ILD by altering the negative selection of autoreactive T cells and causing a defect in central immune tolerance."
"9408647","Abstract: There are several criteria by which the success or failure of implantable materials can be measured; but, without question, the manner in which the host responds to the implanted material will be a critical determinant of outcome. Largely, the interaction of immune cells with implanted materials has been considered a precursor to the foreign body reaction with associated negative impacts upon functionality. Recently, the role of the innate immune system, particularly that of macrophages, in the host response to biomaterials has received renewed attention. It has now been shown that macrophages, depending upon highly plastic and context- dependent polarization profiles (i.e. M1 pro-inflammatory vs. M2 anti-inflammatory/regulatory), are also capable of affecting positive outcomes following biomaterial implantation. This emerging understanding of the essential constructive and regulatory roles of macrophages in positive outcomes represents a significant departure from the classical paradigms of host biomaterial interactions. It now appears desirable that emerging biomaterials-based approaches to tissue reconstruction should not only accommodate but also promote involvement of the immune system to facilitate positive outcomes. However, such approaches cannot be developed without a detailed understanding of both the contributions of individual macrophage subtypes to tissue remodeling and integration and the context in which host encounters the implant.  The present proposal seeks to develop a comprehensive and integrated approach to broadening the current understanding of how macrophages, their functional subsets, and host characteristics affect the host response to biomaterials. The proposed work builds upon our previous studies demonstrating that macrophage M1/M2 polarization at early time points is predictive of downstream integration outcomes and that the implantation microenvironment (i.e. tissue type, age, disease status) strongly affects the host response and subsequent tissue remodeling outcomes. Additionally, we have developed a number of model systems for assessing the specific contributions of M1 and M2 macrophages in the host response to biomaterials and novel methods for the modulation of the host response at the biomaterial surface. Collectively, these studies will provide crucial insight into the use of biomaterials as implants and provide methods for promoting improved outcomes associated with their use. ."
"9412500","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DHA intake of US adults is low and conversion of ?-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) to DHA (22:6n-3) is also low. As a result US women enter pregnancy with lower DHA status than other countries in the developed world suggesting a potential deficiency of an important nutrient that has been shown to reduce inflammation. The goal of this Phase III Clinical Trial (randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled) is to test the primary hypothesis that supplementing US women with 1000 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 800 mg above the amount currently in many prenatal nutritional supplements (~200 mg) during the half of pregnancy can reduce early preterm birth (ePTB) (<34 wk. gestation). This was a favorable secondary outcomes of a US trial (RO1 HD047315, Clinical Trials.gov ID: NCT00266825) conducted at one of the proposed study sites on which the current proposal is modeled. Secondary outcomes include birth weight <1500g and pregnancy outcomes (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, C-section delivery). We propose a Bayesian Adaptive Design with 90% power to detect the hypothesized outcomes with an estimated 938 subjects that allows the study to stop early if strong results (probability >0.995) are observed before the study is scheduled to end and places 60% of the participants on the better DHA dose. Conventional equal randomization with 90% power would require 1200 subjects, be longer, and place only 50% of the participants on the better DHA dose. The proposed study has the potential to determine if nutritional supplementation with DHA during pregnancy can reduce the incidence of ePTB, a serious public health problem with large societal and family costs. The randomization design has the potential to significantly expedite findings to the research community and clinical practice."
"9427792","Abstract  Metabolic remodeling is an integral part of pathogenic process of heart failure. From an unbiased transcriptome analysis focusing on known metabolic pathways, we unexpectedly found that branched chain amino acids (BCAA) catabolic pathway is one of the most significantly affected in mouse failure hearts. Subsequently, we revealed that BCAA catabolic defect and the resulted intra-cardiac accumulation of branched- chain keto acid (BCKA) are common metabolic features in human failing hearts. The detrimental impact of BCKA accumulation on cardiac function is associated with its direct effect on mitochondrial ROS induction and complex I specific inhibition. Most importantly, genetic inhibition of BCAA catabolic activity promoted pressure-overload induced heart failure while restoring BCAA catabolic activity and reducing BCKA accumulation significantly blunted the onset of heart failure. These exciting new findings established, for the first time, a direct and causal role of BCAA catabolic defect in heart failure, and provide proof of concept evidence to treat heart failure by targeting BCAA catabolic activity. These preliminary data lead to our novel hypothesis that stress-induced BCAA catabolic defect results in cardiac accumulation of BCKA which exerts detrimental effect on heart via impairment of mitochondria function and ROS induction (Figure 1). In this proposal, we will investigate the validity of our hypothesis via vigorous in vivo and in vitro examination, and establish the therapeutic potential of restoring BCAA catabolic activity for heart failure. Specifically, we will accomplish the following three specific aims: Aim 1. To determine cell-autonomous contribution of BCAA catabolic defect in cardiomyocyte to the pathogenesis of heart failure: Using novel mouse model, we will genetically impair BCAA catabolic activity specifically in adult cardiomyocytes and examine the direct impact on cardiac function and pathological remodeling under basal as well as in response to pressure-overload or chronic ISO stimulation. Aim 2. To unravel the cellular and molecular basis of BCKA induced cardiac dysfunction: We will determine both in vitro and in vivo the specific impact of BCKA accumulation on mitochondrial function, the connection between complex I inhibition and ROS induction, and impact of BCKA accumulation on myocyte viability and pathological remodeling. Aim 3 To validate the therapeutic potential of targeting BCKD Kinase for HF therapy. we will test the function impact of restoring BCAA catabolic activity by genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting BCKD kinase on the pathological progression of HF. Together, this project will uncover a novel and important aspect of pathological remodeling in heart failure, fill a significant gap of knowledge in our current understanding of cardiac pathogenesis, and help to identify novel therapeutic target for this major disease."
"9392172","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) controls cell growth by integrating a wide range of signals, such as growth factors, nutrients, and stress. mTOR is a conserved protein kinase that forms two complexes, referred to as TORC1 and TORC2, with distinct subunit composition and physiological functions. The physiological function of TORC1 in promoting cell growth is well characterized and inhibitors that target the complex are used clinically to treat several diseases including cancer, transplant rejection, and restenosis. The mechanism of TORC1 regulation is a topic of intense interest in both basic cell biology and translational research. Growth factors and nutrients activate TORC1 to promote cell growth by stimulating anabolism and inhibiting catabolism. Previous studies have investigated TORC1 regulation by growth factors and nutrients. However, the molecular insights of inhibitory signals that regulate TORC1 are ambiguous. Both oxidative stress and hyperosmotic stress rapidly and potently inhibit TORC1. Our preliminary studies indicate that the nemo like kinase (NLK) plays a crucial role in TORC1 inhibition in response to hyperosmotic or oxidative stress. In addition to oxidative and hyperosmotic stress, we observed that protein kinase A (PKA) mediates an inhibitory effect to mTORC1 in response to the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP). The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TORC1 regulation and the function of TORC1 in cell physiology and disease. In this proposal, we will determine the biological function and molecular mechanism of NLK in mediating the osmotic and oxidative stress to inhibit TORC1. Furthermore, we will investigate the mechanisms of mTORC1 inhibition by PKA and functional cross talk between cAMP and mTORC1. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1. Determine the function of NLK in TORC1 regulation by osmotic and oxidative stress 2. Elucidate the biochemical basis of NLK in TORC1 inhibition by osmotic and oxidative stress 3. Investigate the molecular mechanisms and functional role of TORC1 inhibition by cAMP-PKA"
"9423568","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Approximately one million individuals, an estimated 40-72% with cognitive impairment or a diagnosis of Alzheimer?s disease-related dementias (ADRD), reside in assisted living (AL); yet, little is known about their experience or the quality of care offered. Unlike other forms of long-term care (LTC), such as nursing homes that are federally regulated, the licensing, operating, and enforcement requirements for AL falls to the states, which vary dramatically in their approaches to regulating this growing industry. As AL assumes an increased role in providing LTC to vulnerable older adults with ADRD, there is an urgent need to understand the positive and negative effects of state regulations on quality of care. Our long-term goal is to improve care outcomes for AL residents, with a specific emphasis on residents with ADRD who often cannot advocate for themselves. The overall objective of this application is to examine states? AL regulatory environments and understand if and how the health outcomes of AL residents with ADRD are impacted by states? regulatory decisions. The central hypothesis is that in order to survive, AL providers adhere to licensing requirements and respond to changes in the regulatory environment, which ultimately impact AL residents? outcomes. The rationale for the proposed research is that better understanding the experiences of AL residents with ADRD and how they vary based on a state?s approach to regulating this industry will help to inform policy and payment decisions and ultimately improve the outcomes of older adults with ADRD needing LTC. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Characterize how states regulate AL as it relates to the care of residents with ADRD; 2) Test the effect of regulations on providers? responses and outcomes of AL residents with ADRD; 3) Compare outcomes between residents with ADRD who reside in ALs licensed to provide specialized dementia care to residents in non-specialized ALs. Under the first aim, investigators will build on their previous efforts to identify and examine the history, oversight, and enforcement of states? AL regulations likely to impact outcomes of residents with ADRD. In the second aim, investigators will apply a novel methodology they developed through an R21 from the National Institute on Aging (#R21AG047303) to identify AL residents using Medicare data and with rigorous methods examine the effect of regulatory changes on providers? behaviors and residents? outcomes over a 10-year period. Under the third aim, investigators will apply an observational, quasi-experimental methodology to examine the effect of living in a dementia- specialized AL on residents? outcomes. This approach is innovative because it is the first to examine the outcomes of AL residents with ADRD, nationally, and the impact of the widely varying AL regulations on healthcare outcomes. The proposed research is significant because it will provide valuable information to states as they seek the most effective ways to regulate this growing industry. Ultimately, such information has the potential to improve the outcomes of vulnerable older adults with ADRD who utilize AL."
"9396026","Project Summary/Abstract The leading cause of both infant mortality and long-term health morbidities in children is preterm birth (PTB). PTB has a higher incidence in women who work night shifts, suggesting that disruptions in circadian rhythms (daily sleep/wake and activity cycles that are aligned with environmental stimuli) contribute to PTB. Further supporting this idea are reports that low fecundity, pregnancy loss, and abnormal delivery are found commonly in mice with mutations in genes that control circadian rhythms. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that the timing of birth is determined by maternal signals, but how the circadian system affects maternal signals is not well understood. The ?master clock? within the brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), regulates ?peripheral clocks? in all cells, including those in reproductive tissues. Little is known about the roles of circadian rhythms in maternal reproductive tissues and the timing of birth. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the maternal circadian clock plays a key role in determining the timing of birth by regulating peripheral clocks within the uterus and secretion of the pregnancy maintenance hormone progesterone (P4). This hypothesis is based on preliminary and published data. Preliminary work revealed that mice with short circadian periods deliver earlier than wild-type mice, both the uterus and the cervix have endogenous rhythms, and pregnant dams become active progressively earlier each day, beginning on day four of pregnancy, and then abruptly revert back to later onset of locomotor activity two to three days before delivery. These shifts align with a rise in P4 production beginning in early pregnancy and a dramatic drop in P4 a few days before delivery. P4 withdrawal in mice mimics a functional P4 withdrawal in humans and triggers labor. Early P4 withdrawal is a common risk factor for PTB in humans. I will address my hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: 1) define the pattern of uterine and cervical clock gene expression throughout pregnancy, 2) determine the role of the uterine and SCN clocks in the timing of birth and 3) define the relationship between levels of P4 and activity rhythms in late pregnancy. Completion of these aims will yield several basic science outcomes that are significant because they will add to our understanding of the relationship between the circadian and reproductive system as they relate to timing of birth. These findings could be important first steps towards reducing the number of preterm births to nights shift workers and/or ameliorating the harmful effects of PTB. The proposed studies support a postdoctoral training plan that includes interdisciplinary technical training, scientific meetings and consultation with leaders in both reproductive and circadian fields, which will prepare the applicant for beginning the transition to early investigator."

The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population?using a novel smartphone- based tool?and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1?! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2?! Develop a ?dynamic? heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available?including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions."
"9535532","Project Summary  Candida albicans is a frequent commensal of the microbiota and an important opportunistic pathogen, responsible for both mucosal and systemic infections. This species is chameleon-like in its ability to adapt to different niches and to grow in different morphological forms. Here, we address the mechanism by which C. albicans undergoes phenotypic switching between ?white? and ?opaque? states. These two cell states exhibit differences in mating, filamentation, biofilm formation, immune interactions and virulence, making a molecular understanding of switching of importance to C. albicans biology.  The white-opaque switch is regulated by a highly interconnected network of 6 or more master transcription factors (TFs) that act coordinately to define the two cell states. Our proposal seeks to address how prion-like domains (PrLDs) present in these TFs contribute to their function in regulating the white-opaque transcription network. We will test the hypothesis that PrLDs enable phase separation of the master TFs, thereby promoting the assembly of transcriptional complexes within liquid droplets. Researchers have proposed that a similar phase separation model underlies the transcriptional regulation of ?super-enhancers? in mammalian cells. This project therefore has the potential to determine the fundamental role of phase separation in cell fate decisions in eukaryotic cells.  We provide exciting preliminary data that establishes that multiple TFs in the white-opaque circuit contain PrLDs, that recombinant forms of these TFs readily undergo efficient phase separation in vitro, and that deletion or mutation of PrLDs abrogates their function. In addition, we show that TF-TF interactions can be detected using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay that we have adapted for use in C. albicans to define protein-protein interactions. The Aims of the proposal are: AIM 1. To determine the propensity for white-opaque TFs to undergo phase separation in vitro. The 6 master TFs at the core of the white-opaque circuit will be purified and their ability to phase separate and form liquid droplets defined. Experiments will also address the precise contribution of PrLDs to the ability of TFs to undergo liquid-liquid demixing in vitro. AIM 2. To define the contribution of PrLDs to TF function in C. albicans white-opaque switching. We will determine the functional role of PrLDs by deletion of these domains and analysis of TF function in white-opaque switching assays. In addition, we will examine whether PrLDs promote protein-protein interactions by the use of BiFC assays to monitor these interactions in live C. albicans cells.  Together, the proposed experiments will define the mechanism by which TFs regulate the white- opaque switch in C. albicans, and will test the exciting hypothesis that PrLDs make a key contribution to eukaryotic transcription networks by promoting phase separation and enabling TF complex formation."
"9454819","Admin Core Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. The Administrative Core will be responsible for managing, coordinating, and supervising the entire range of SCRIPT Systems Biology Center activities. As such, the Administrative Core will intersect with all internal SCRIPT investigators as well as the NIAID sponsoring agency, other Systems Biology Centers, and the broader infectious diseases and pulmonary/critical care scientific communities. The SCRIPT Systems Biology Center is intentionally multidisciplinary, increasing the complexity of interactions and mandating a centralized approach to facilitate accomplishing the goals of this Systems Biology Center. The Administrative Core will accomplish these objectives in three interrelated specific aims: AIM 1. To provide the administrative and organizational infrastructure to facilitate accomplishment of the SCRIPT goals within proposed timelines, and to disseminate the output of the Research Projects and Cores. This will include the submission of SCRIPT Systems Biology Center output to NIAID-directed public databases/repositories. AIM 2. To coordinate and integrate the two SCRIPT Systems Biology Center Research Projects. AIM 3. To organize local and external outreach programs to promote a systems biology approach to infectious pneumonia. This includes integration of the SCRIPT Systems Biology Center into current local training programs, submission of an application to Gordon Research Conference or similar conference for a research symposium on a systems biology approach to pneumonia and a proposal to the American Thoracic Society for a post graduate course on Systems Biology Approaches to Pneumonia. The major premise of the SCRIPT Systems Biology Center research agenda is an iterative approach to host/pathogen interactions based on results of high throughput omics approaches and modeling of the results. We therefore expect that prior results will drive subsequent experiments. Integration and facilitation of these subsequent experiments between the different Cores and investigators will be the primary responsibility of the Administrative Core. Investigators in the Administrative Core will also ensure that data generated by the Projects and Cores are disseminated in formats that are useful to the larger community of pneumonia researchers."
"9469405","Abstract Polyploidy (whole genome duplication) is a fundamental aspect of cardiac biology. Metazoan heart structures, from insects to humans, undergo ploidy increases during development and in response to stress and injury. Polyploidy has many functions, from increases in cell size (hypertrophy) and transcriptional capacity to protection from infection and oxidative stress. However, the specific role of developmental or physiological polyploidy in cardiac organogenesis, function, and injury response is unknown. Polyploidy is considered a possible barrier to cardiac proliferation and therapeutic regeneration as ploidy increases coincide with the switch from proliferative to ploidy-increasing hypertrophic tissue repair programs in mammalian development. Thus, by improving our understanding of the significance and regulation of cardiac polyploidy, we can better devise strategies to improve the function of injured hearts. This proposal will develop the Drosophila heart as a model to uncover the conserved yet enigmatic role of polyploidy in heart development and tissue repair. As in mammals, cardiomyocytes of the simple, tubular Drosophila heart are known to polyploidize during development and the adult fly heart can undergo hypertrophy. However, little is known about when Drosophila cardiac polyploidization occurs, its regulation and function, and the interplay between physiological and injury-induced polyploidy. The polyploidization of fly cardiomyocytes will be characterized and perturbed during development and after injury. In Aim 1, the timing and extent of polyploidization during development will be determined. Then, polyploidization will be perturbed and heart function assayed to uncover physiological roles in the heart. Lastly, the gene expression profiles of polyploid and mutant diploid cardiomyocytes will be compared to determine polyploidization-induced genes. In Aim 2, the effect of ploidy on tissue injury responses will be studied. Injury before and after cardiac polyploidization will determine if a developmental switch occurs between proliferative and hypertrophic tissue repair programs. To accomplish this Aim, cardiomyocytes will be genetically ablated and resulting cardiomyocyte proliferation and hypertrophy measured using cell counts and cell cycle markers. Next, ablation experiments will be conducted in mutant diploid and precociously polyploid cardiomyocytes to examine the effect of polyploidy on tissue injury repair. Finally, gene expression changes at a temporal switch in tissue injury repair responses will be compared to find regulators of distinct cardiac injury responses. The above proposed experiments will establish a genetically tractable model with conserved features of cardiac development to uncover the long-appreciated but poorly-understood role of polyploidy in cardiac biology."
"9413471","Disorders of hemoglobin production are the most common inherited disorders of hematopoiesis, and are a cause of immense human morbidity and economic loss across the globe. Recent advances in gene-editing technology have demonstrated the potential to directly manipulate the endogenous globin locus in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. However, significant barriers remain for translation of gene editing as an effective therapeutic approach to disorders of globin production, including 1) definition of gene-edited globin locus architectures that support high levels of non-sickling globin production, 2) maintenance of multi-lineage reconstitution capability of gene-edited HSPC, and 3) development of methods for efficient engraftment and selection of gene-edited HPSC. In this application, we propose two coordinated specific aims that collectively address these barriers. Specific Aim 1 will utilize recently published methods for efficient HSPC gene editing to define globin locus architecture(s) that support high levels of erythroid specific globin production and that enable post-engraftment selection of gene-edited cells. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate engraftment and selection protocols for gene-edited HSPC in a clinically relevant macaque autologous transplant model. Collectively, the proposed studies will define an optimized globin gene editing procedure along with a IND-enabling pre-clinical data set that will serve as a foundation for translation of therapeutic gene editing for disorders of ?-globin synthesis to phase I clinical testing in humans."
"9425357","Project summary Cardiac arrhythmias are prevalent and are associated with substantial morbidity and healthcare utilization. In particular, supraventricular tachycardias and bradyarrhythmias are common causes of palpitations and syncope, and may lead to sudden death in some circumstances. Many treatments for these conditions are incompletely effective or associated with potential adverse effects. Despite the recognized public health importance of arrhythmias, there is a limited understanding of their mechanisms.  Our overall goals are to identify the causes of arrhythmias and improve treatments for affected patients. The specific objective of this proposal is to leverage large-scale human genetic association studies to understand the mechanisms of both supraventricular tachycardias and bradyarrhythmias. The proposal is motivated by three key observations.  First, monogenic forms of supraventricular tachycardias and bradyarrhythmias, familial aggregation of these arrhythmias, and preliminary data identifying common variation associated with these conditions all indicate that there is a substantial genetic basis for supraventricular tachycardias and bradyarrhythmias. Yet genome-wide association studies, a highly efficient method for understanding human disease, are lacking for these conditions. Second, we have substantial experience with collaborative genetic association analyses of arrhythmias, and have established the Arrhythmia GENetics (AGENT) neTwork, a multi-site consortium of investigators that will contribute samples for the proposed aims. Third, our team is comprised of experts in complex trait and arrhythmia genetics who have developed innovative methods to enable functional characterization of identified genetic loci.  The applicant is an Early Stage Investigator with experience in arrhythmia genetics. In Aims 1 and 2 of the current proposal, we will identify genetic susceptibility loci associated with supraventricular tachycardias and bradyarrhythmias by performing genome-wide association studies in well-characterized individuals. In Aim 3 we will quantify the aggregate genetic contributions to supraventricular tachycardias and bradyarrhythmias, systematically assess the genetic architecture of these arrhythmias, and estimate the genetic correlation of arrhythmias and related phenotypes. In Aim 4, we will move from association to mechanism by characterizing the electrophysiological phenotype of the top supraventricular tachycardia and bradyarrhythmia genes in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, a zebrafish model system, and by cellular electrophysiology.  We anticipate that our multi-faceted approach will facilitate an improved understanding of the causes of arrhythmias. Such insights may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for patient management and a comprehensive understanding of cardiovascular biology relevant to the broader scientific community."
"9422279","Project Summary Nearly 15 million transfusions are performed in the United States each year, with approximately 425,000 units transfused to pediatric patients alone. Despite the frequency ? transfusion procedures are not without risk. Blood transfusion complications may be attributed to heavy exposure to plastic devices, which are fabricated with chemicals that exert endocrine disrupting properties. The proposal's main hypothesis is that plastic devices are not universally biocompatible ? and that local and systemic reactions to chemical contaminants contribute to transfusion-related complications. The proposal's objective is to assess whether medical device biocompatibility and chemical exposures are underlying contributors to cardiovascular and autonomic dysfunction. The proposal also aims to identify safer biomaterials, chemicals and/or surface coatings for transfusion devices and blood banking. In this proposal, we will build upon our preliminary studies to address three specific aims: 1) To define the extent to which biomaterial leaching and chemical exposure alters cardiovascular and autonomic function, using in vivo and whole heart models. 2) To determine if biocompatibility and incidental chemical exposures are correlated with cardiovascular and autonomic abnormalities in transfused pediatric patients. 3) To compare and contrast alternative biomaterials, chemicals and fabrication techniques in order to identify safer replacements for transfusion-related devices. The proposed application will quantify the role of biocompatibility and chemical leaching on cardiovascular and autonomic function ? two targets that are highly susceptible to xenobiotic toxicity. If adverse outcomes are observed in the proposed study, it will pinpoint additional variables to monitor in future clinical investigations and epidemiological studies. Finally, this proposal aims to provide the foundation for objective decision making regarding the use of chemical additives with endocrine disrupting properties in medical device manufacturing by scientific, medical and regulatory communities. Results of the proposed studies can incentivize and accelerate the development and clinical adoption of alternative biomaterials, additives and/or fabrication techniques to improve transfusion patient safety."
"9447971","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in global health, malaria infects 212M and kills 429,000 people annually. Lack of effective vaccines and emergence of drug-resistant strains makes new therapeutic approaches essential. Childhood mortality rates in children <36 months remain exceedingly high in holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum transmission regions such as Siaya, Kenya, due to severe malarial anemia [SMA, hemoglobin (Hb)<5.0 g/dL]. Over the last 14 years, at our state-of-the-art clinical research facilities in Siaya, we focused on how innate immunity and co-morbidities influence clinical outcomes in childhood malaria. Over a three-year follow-up period, we found that 93% of the children had malaria, and 22.7% developed SMA. To identify the most significant pathways that discriminate SMA from milder forms of disease, we spent the last several years using a combination of global genomic approaches to create a convergent model for identification of disease signatures. These studies demonstrated that immune response genes are the strongest predictors for SMA, thus, narrowing the search from the entire genome to pathways involved in the host-immune response. Based on these findings and recent preliminary data, we propose to use targeted RNAseq with a platform that contains of 500 immune response genes (innate and adaptive immunity) which have not been concomitantly explored in malaria. Since our findings demonstrate that the immune response to P. falciparum drives adverse clinical outcomes for several weeks, even after clearance of the parasite, malarial anemia is an ideal candidate for immunotherapy. Thus, the overall goal of the project is to identify critical gene pathways within the transcriptome that mediate disease severity and then target these specific genes with compounds that elicit expression profiles witnessed in children with milder forms of disease. To achieve this goal, we will complete the following specific aims: 1) Determine how changing temporal dynamics of gene pathways in the Malarial Immunity Transcriptome promote SMA during acute disease; 2) Determine how changes in gene pathways in the Malarial Immunity Transcriptome mediate malarial severity throughout the development of naturally- acquired immunity; and 3) Identify immunotherapeutic targets in the Malarial Immunity Transcriptome that can be used to reduce malaria disease severity and improve clinical outcomes in future trials. To successfully complete these aims, we will determine how host and parasitic expression profiles impact on acute disease over 14 days (cohort 1) and validate these findings in a longitudinal birth cohort (cohort 2) during the child's 1st episode of acute malaria. We will also determine the impact of changing host and parasite temporal expression profiles on the development of naturally-acquired immunity over 36 months (cohort 2). Ex vivo samples from the two cohorts will be used to test the effect of immunotherapeutic compounds on host expression profiles. Accomplishing these goals will have broad reaching translational implications for: (1) identifying at-risk groups, and (2) prioritizing compounds that can be used to improve clinical outcomes in future immunotherapy trials."

"9466069","Central venous catheters (CVLs) provide lifesaving medications, nutrition and laboratory testing for millions of patients a year. As with any medical device, they can become infected (250,000 infections/year in US), increasing patients' mortality and length of hospital stay.  The goal of our project is to improve outcomes for patients with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), a common type of CVL, by reducing dangerous complications related to central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI; 10-35 % mortality rate).  We believe that stopping adhesion to the surface of the catheter will reduce complications related to infection patients with catheters. Our omniphobic coating stops adhesion of all manner of pathogens (bacteria and fungi) to the surface of medical devices by immobilizing a thin layer of highly inert and biocompatible perfluorinated liquid. In our previous work, we demonstrated that our novel tethered-liquid perfluorocarbon (TLP) coating resists pathogen adhesion in vitro and resists the adhesion of blood clotting components to the surface of medical devices, ultimately resulting in significantly less thrombosis in a challenging in vivo arteriovenous shunt model.  In Phase I, we propose the development of a first-in-class TLP-coated PICC catheter that significantly reduces or eliminates catheter-associated infection in patients, potentially resulting shorter hospital stays and less mortality related to hospital-acquired infections. Milestones for Phase I include: 1) showing TLP-coated catheters resist biofouling of many CLABSI-relevant pathogens; 2) demonstrating that the TLP-coated catheters maintain biofouling resistance under extended blood serum flow.  If Phase I is successful, in Phase II the TLP-coated catheter will be further evaluated for in vivo biocompatibility in preparation for FDA approval and potentially clinical practice. If successful in this challenging application, the TLP coating could help patients in many other vascular applications and more broadly in medical devices."
"9508523","Project Summary: Role of Candida albicans phosphate transport in cell wall maintenance and echinocandin tolerance The goal of this proposal is to delineate the mechanisms by which the Candida albicans high-affinity phosphate transporter Pho84 enables this fungal pathogen to maintain its cell wall and to withstand drugs of the echinocandin class. C. albicans cells lacking Pho84 are attenuated for virulence in mucosal and systemic murine infection models. Our previous work shows that inhibiting Pho84 with small molecules, including an FDA-approved antiviral agent, potentiates the activity of the echinocandin micafungin. Similarly, null mutants in PHO84 are hypersensitive to micafungin, and to other agents of cell wall stress, while failing to properly activate the cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathway. Based on findings of metabolomics experiments, we hypothesize that the mechanism by which C. albicans Pho84 contributes to cell wall biosynthesis and cell wall integrity signaling, is by activating phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase through provision of sufficient cytosolic phosphate. PRPP is a central metabolic intermediate in biosynthesis of cell wall polymer precursors, and PRPP synthetase interacts with cell wall integrity signaling in a model yeast, suggesting a testable model: failure of PRPP synthetase activation deprives cell wall biosynthesis of necessary precursors and diminishes CWI signaling during cell wall stress. The proposed work will test four hypotheses resulting from this model, using methods well established in the laboratory. The overall impact of this proposal is that defining connections between phosphate homeostasis, cell wall biosynthesis and cell wall integrity signaling will contribute novel aspects to our understanding of C. albicans virulence and possibly uncover molecules appropriate for targeting with new antifungal compounds."

"9510944","Project Summary: This project seeks support to develop a new laser-based methodology to monitor mosquitoes acting as vectors for infectious diseases. For diseases with no effective cure, such as Dengue and Zika fever, vector control remains the most effective way to protect human populations. However, the spatial distribution of mosquito species is currently tedious to monitor as it relies mostly on unpractical physical traps. Lack of reliable data on the spatial distribution and population dynamics of key mosquito species has become a major obstacle to the development of predictive spatial models for risk of exposure to key vectors. The proposed research goal is to develop and test in laboratory a dual-wavelength polarization sensitive lidar system to count and identify in real-time the species and gender of flying mosquitoes over large range (> 100 m) directly in their natural habitat. Aim 1 is to test the capability of this novel methodology to retrieve optical properties and wing beat frequency of flying mosquitoes transiting through the laser beam in a controlled environment. Measurements in the near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral range will be carried out over a distance of 5 to 10 meters on 4 mosquito species related to infectious diseases. We hypothesize that the light backscattering coefficients and light depolarization ratios of the insect?s body and wings can be remotely retrieved as well as the wing beat frequency, which is supported by our preliminary results. Aim 2 is to define whether the retrieved information can be used as a unique signature to identify the mosquito species and sex-group. Wing beat frequency has been demonstrated in previous studies as an effective mean to identify the insect family and gender for mosquitoes, also confirmed by our preliminary results. We hypothesize that individuals from a same species will present relatively similar optical properties when compared to individuals from another species. Body and wing colors, degree of melanization and roughness vary from a species to another. Therefore, we expect to observe differences when measuring optical properties from different species. Detection limits and sensibility of the laboratory setup will be evaluated in light of aim 1 and 2 outcomes and compared with our existing numerical model.  Upon completion, this project will have validated a new methodology to monitor in real time mosquitoes transmitting infectious diseases with a potential to transform our ability to collect data on infectious disease vectors. With global warming changing their possible habitat, this methodology allows much faster detection of key insect species, identifying thousands of mosquitoes in a few hours compared to weeks with current techniques. The instrument will be used to improve the effectiveness of vector control strategy from public authorities, as well as studying the impact of new and existing mosquito control methodologies (biocontrol, pesticides, trapping). The results of this feasibility study will provide strong preliminary data to guide the design of a larger system for actual field measurements that will be proposed to the R21 program."
"9395913","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anopheline mosquitoes transmit malaria, the world's most devastating parasitic disease, of which Anopheles gambiae is the principal vector for malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa. Different populations of mosquitoes vary widely in how readily they become infected with malaria parasites, while some strains do not transmit malaria at all. The mosquitoes' innate immune system is a significant factor that may influence the level of malaria infection; in particular the thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) targets malaria parasite for destruction during their initial invasion of the body cavity. The TEP1 gene varies significantl across mosquito populations with two major classes of alleles, TEP1*S and TEP1*R, that have been shown to directly influence the susceptibility to P. falciparum. In this project we will study the structure-function relationship between TEP1 alleles and their interaction with a mosquito-specific family of leucine-rich repeat proteins, the LRIM1/APL1 family. We will also study the diversity of structure and function associated with three closely-related LRR proteins APL1A, APL1B and APL1C, that influence the specificity of the TEP1 immune response. Finally, we will study the structure and function of three CLIP domain serine protease homologs (SPHs) that regulate downstream effects of TEP1 deposition, specifically melanization. The results of this project will shed light on the mechanism of mosquitoes' natural immunity to malaria infection and support the development of new vector-based transmission-blocking strategies."

"9416822","PROJECT SUMMARY With a national prevalence estimate of 3.9 per 100,000 people, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most common disabling neuromuscular diseases among adults in the United States. Eighty-five percent of persons with ALS demonstrate swallowing impairment (dysphagia) over the course of the disease (Carpenter, McDonald, & Howard, 1978; Chen & Garrett, 2005). Despite the significant impact that the loss of swallowing function has in persons with ALS ( Fattori et al., 2006) for a variety of reasons, including the variability of , disease progression from person to person, the inconsistency of symptom onset, and the lack of sensitivity to small amounts of change found in currently used outcome measures, predicting symptom progression over the course of the disease is difficult (Rutkove et al., 2007). As a result, clinical management of dysphagia in this population is a significant challenge. Therefore, there is a great need for research directed at improving biomarkers of swallowing decline. In the proposed research, we will investigate the relation between anatomic and biomechanic markers of the tongue and changes in swallow physiology, swallow severity, and swallow safety in persons with ALS. In AIM 1, we will correlate anatomic measures of the tongue using electrical impedance myography (EIM) with measures of swallow physiology, severity, and safety. Additionally, we will use electrical impedance myography (EIM) to determine whether changes in lingual muscle tissue health are present in persons with ALS who are pre-symptomatic of bulbar impairment. Prior research on EIM, as well as preliminary data in our lab, suggests that lingual EIM will be sensitive to the disease process prior to symptom onset and over the course of the disease process. In Aim 2, we will correlate biomechanic measures of the tongue (speed, range of motion, and coordination) during the swallow with measures of swallow physiology, swallow severity, and swallow safety. Our preliminary data suggests that lingual range of motion during the swallow is highly correlated with swallow function. The overall goal of the proposed research is to improve biomarkers of swallow impairment, which will significantly improve clinical management of dysphagia for persons with ALS. Results of this research will allow for improved prognostic capabilities and improved ability to implement physiologically based therapeutic techniques aimed at prolonging swallow function."
"9625846","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Superwarfarins are modified forms of warfarin (Coumadin) with greater toxicity and longer duration of action. They potently reduce vitamin K levels throughout the body by inhibiting its recycling leading to loss of activity of Vitamin K dependent proteins including prothrombin. Loss of prothrombin leads to systemic anticoagulation, hence the basis for the widespread use of superwarfarins as rodenticides and to reduced embolisms in stroke patients. Superwarfarins were developed following reports of warfarin resistant rodent strains and are now commonly used throughout the world. Reported clinical occurrences of superwarfarin poisoning have reached over 16,000 per year in the USA, with >90% in children under age 6. Although superwarfarin poisoning can be treated it requires long term supplementation with Vitamin K, and any interruption in treatment can lead to recurrence of symptoms. Other VKDPs play important roles in brain development; and reductions in those proteins is associated with increased inflammation, neuronal damage, loss of myelin, and cognitive deficits. In addition, in utero exposure to warfarin has adverse effects on embryonic development, suggesting the in utero exposure to superwarfarins could have disastrous outcomes. The superwarfarin most commonly used today as a rodenticide is brodifacoum (BDF). The estimated fatal oral dose for humans is very low (15 mg), and because it is highly lipophilic, it accumulates in tissues with a biological half-life of over 20 days. Thu, even though there is an existing cure BDF poisoning (chronic Vitamin K treatment), its toxicity, exceptionally long half-life, the relative ease of obtaining it, and the array of potential methods for its harmful distribution (contamination by aerosol dispersal or direct application on plants sol, or food), make BDF a serious potential chemical threat. In this proposal, we will test the therapeutic potential of an already approved FDA treatment, Lipid Emulsion (LE), as a countermeasure against BDF poisoning. The infusion of LE is already used to treat certain toxic drug overdoses, and is thought to act in part by scavenging toxins and movement to the liver where they are metabolized. Acute LE infusion should offer rapid removal of BDF from the body, thereby preventing life threatening reductions in clotting, protect against long-term debilitating CNS sequelae of poisoning; and prevention of in utero exposure. In addition, since intravenous administration of a counter measure may be impractical in a scenario involving mass casualties, we have developed an alternative method of administration, namely intraosseous (IO) which infuses LE into bone where it can rapidly enter the blood stream. In this program, we will optimize the ability of IO LE to eliminate BDF from adult rat tissues. If levels are not sufficienty reduced by a single IO bolus, we will add follow up IV infusions of LE. We will characterize the consequences of in utero exposure to BDF, and optimize treatment of pregnant rats with LE to minimize those later consequences. A major goal of this project is to submit an IND for the use of LE to treat BDF poisoning; since testing in humans is not feasible, in year 4 of this project we will carry out similar studies in rabbits to match the FDA requirements under the animal rule for a new drug. We anticipate that LE will be proven to be an effective treatment for BDF poisoning, thereby providing a mechanism to address the potential damage due to a large scale release of BDF by either intentional or accidental causes."

"9472652","Project Summary/Abstract: Working memory is an essential cognitive faculty. Individual differences in working memory functioning can be quantified by working memory capacity (WMC). Higher WMC enables better performance in a diverse set of cognitive operations, including attention, reading comprehension, planning, and problem solving. There is evidence suggesting that higher WMC even confers the individual with the ability to better resist cognitive impairments in brain disorders. Despite its importance as a psychological construct, the neurophysiological underpinnings of WMC, however, remain not well understood. We will address this issue by pursuing Aim 1 in which we will investigate the individual differences in the task-related modulation of frontoparietal theta oscillations during working memory encoding and retention. Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that frontal theta power and frontoparietal theta coherence decrease with increasing working memory load during encoding and increase with increasing working memory load during retention and that theta modulation by working memory load during encoding and retention is positively correlated with working memory capacity. Research to date on the relation between neuronal oscillations and cognition tends to be correlative. Noninvasive neuromodulation provides a means to uncover the causal role of neuronal oscillations in cognition. In Aim 2 we will test the efficacy of tACS stimulation at theta frequency in enhancing task-related theta modulation and working memory capacity. Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that in-phase theta tACS stimulation of the frontoparietal network upregulates task-related modulation of theta oscillations in working memory and enhances working memory capacity and that individuals with low working memory capacity will benefit more from in-phase theta tACS stimulation than individuals with high working memory capacity."
"9447855","PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal is based on an Academic-Industrial partnership between Vanderbilt University and Anasys Instruments Inc. that seeks to successfully bring a new imaging capability in endocrine cancer surgery to the end-user? the surgeon, for the intraoperative identification of the parathyroid gland. Here we propose to develop optical imaging in the near infrared for the real time visualization of relevant structures in the neck during endocrine surgery ? an application and a technology that has no predicate  Thyroid and parathyroid diseases rely on surgery for definitive treatment. In these over 100,000 surgeries performed each year in the US, parathyroid glands are difficult to distinguish from the thyroid and surrounding tissues in the neck, due to its small size and variability in position. Complications occur when the parathyroid is accidentally injured or removed during thyroidectomies or only partially removed in the case of parathyroidectomies. In the former, hypoparathyroidsim and hypocalcemia can occur, resulting in serious long term effects. The incidence of hypocalcemia is reported to occur in 9-21% of total thyroidectomies. In fact, hypocalcemia is the most common cause of malpractice litigation after endocrine surgery. Therefore, there is a critical need for a sensitive tool that can identify the parathyroid glands intraoperatively, regardless of disease state.  Vanderbilt and Anasys jointly propose the clinical translation of near infrared autofluorescence to improve patient outcome in endocrine cancer surgeries. The scientific innovation is in the application of an optical technique for surgical guidance that is not focused on disease detection but on anatomical identification of a physiological organ regardless of its disease state with near 100% accuracy. The technique of near infrared fluorescence (particularly in the wavelength range proposed here) has never been commercially implemented using natural biological fluorophores as the contrast agent. Further, combining fluorescence imaging with laser speckle imaging with tissue overlay for real-time assessment of the anatomy and function of the parathyroid gland adds to the innovation of this work.  The specific aims of the proposed project are as follows: (1) Validate the fluorescence of tissues in the neck during endocrine surgery (2) Evaluate the basis of the observed NIR fluorescence. (3) Develop a combined fluorescence and laser speckle imaging system for clinical implementation. (4) Validate the performance of NIR fluorescence prospectively. These objectives, when achieved, will yield two systems ready for commercial translation that can provide real-time optical feedback to reduce the likelihood of long and short term side effects associated with accidental or incomplete removal of parathyroid tissue."
"9495425","PROJECT SUMMARY In this new R01 application entitled ?Understanding the Molecular Genetic Mechanisms of Asthma Risk Loci: IL33, IL1RL1, and GSDMB,? the overarching hypothesis is that common genetic polymorphisms alter the airway responses to environmental cues thus influencing the risk of type 2 inflammation in asthma. The investigators address the limitations of traditional genetic epidemiological studies in identifying how heritable risk loci influence the development of disease. They suggest that common genetic variants interact to increase the risk of type 2 inflammation, the dominant pathology present in the airway of asthmatics. The investigators have developed methods to characterize the degree of type 2 inflammation present in the airways of asthmatics and use these measures to classify subjects as type 2 high or low for the purposes of defining the genetic contribution to molecular disease endotypes. This application proposes in three aims to: 1) identify the causal genetic variants that are associated with asthma in the IL1RL1 gene using CRISPR-Cas9 DNA deletion, 2) to explore the cell biology of IL-33 release and the role of gasdermin proteins in this cellular process, and 3) to explore the expression genetics of IL33 and GSDMB in airway epithelial cells in order to fine-map the observed ?expression quantitative trait loci? and relate these SNPs to risk of type 2 high asthma. Together these studies will serve to 1) further define the genetic risk polymorphisms that influence the development of type 2 high asthma, 2) will elucidate novel pathways for therapeutic intervention, and 3) to define genetically the target population most likely to benefit from novel therapeutics."
"9414445","Project Summary Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide. In the US, there are over 1.5 million new diagnoses and half million deaths annually. Over 90% of solid tumors (e.g., breast, colorectal) are characterized by chromosomal abnormalities including aneuploidy, the loss or gain of chromosomes, which contributes to the genomic instability that drives cancer development. Aneuploidy arises from defects in chromosome segregation during mitosis. In late mitosis, the intercellular bridge (ICB) that connects the two compartments of a dividing cell is severed by a process termed abscission. Abscission provides a mechanism for delaying cell division in the presence of missegregated chromosomes (NoCut checkpoint) that are trapped in the ICB. Thus, defects in abscission and the NoCut checkpoint result in aneuploidy and chromosome damage. Abscission involves the constriction and severing of the ICB membrane by the endocytic sorting complex required for transport-III (ESCRT-III). Assembly of this multi-component membrane complex is spatially and temporally regulated, and requires the targeting and fusion of ESCRT-III-carrying endosomes with the ICB. To date, however, very little is known about of how ESCRT-III assembly is spatio-temporally coordinated with endosome fusion and how it is linked to the NoCut checkpoint. Septins are GTP-binding proteins that are abnormally expressed in many cancers. Septins assemble into higher order structures that control the spatial organization of membrane and cytosolic proteins. In yeast, septins are essential for the spatial coordination of cytokinesis. In mammalian cells, septins are required for the completion of abscission, but their functions are poorly understood. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that septins regulate the assembly of the ESCRT-III complex. Here, we will determine how septins function in the recruitment and assembly of ESCRT- III subunits into rings and spiral filaments. We will test for septin roles in the spatial organization of the ESCRT- III complex and the endosomal delivery of its components. Importantly, the proposed work will examine how abnormalities in septin expression, which are common in cancer, affect the NoCut checkpoint. The proposed studies require training in cutting edge methods of light and electron microscopy (EM) including structured illumination super-resolution microscopy and correlative light and platinum replica EM. The overarching goal of this pre-doctoral fellowship project is to prepare for an independent career in the broader areas of cell and cancer biology. In summary, the proposed project will shed new insights into the mechanisms of cytokinetic abscission and septins, which are abnormally expressed in many cancers, but their roles remain poorly understood."
"9427625","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality with one in six Americans expected to develop AF during their lifetime. As a major cause of stroke, the public health implications of AF are profound. Ongoing research is therefore attempting to better define the mechanisms underlying AF, in order to improve upon current treatments and to develop new therapies for AF.  An important mechanism thought to underlie AF is altered activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), with our recent work demonstrating extensive remodeling of autonomic nerves in the AF atrium. Unfortunately, the upstream molecular mechanisms responsible for this adverse neurological remodeling are not known. Another important mechanism thought to underlie the formation of a vulnerable substrate for AF is oxidative stress (OS), even thought the precise molecular mechanisms by which OS contributes to AF in the intact atrium are not known. Since OS directly or indirectly affects ANS signaling, our overall hypothesis for this proposal is that `OS contributes to electrical substrate for AF by causing structural and functional remodeling of the ANS.' We will test this hypothesis by using a combination of in-vivo and cellular electrophysiology techniques, by performing direct intra-cardiac nerve recordings and by using novel gene therapy approaches we have developed to target OS and ANS signaling in the intact atrium. We will perform these studies in a rapid atrial pacing (i.e. atrial tachycardia or ATR) canine model of AF.  Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis `Chronic OS generation in the atrium/GPs leads to parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve sprouting in the ATR atrium, which is integral to the creation of electrical remodeling (effective refractory period or ERP shortening) in ATR'. In this Aim, we will perform in an ATR model, long term NOX2 inhibition in both atria (by using NOX2 shRNA) and assess: i) ERP shortening/AF and ii) autonomic nerve growth. To determine if remodeled parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves are functional and mediate ERP shortening, we will perform targeted G?i/o ± G?s inhibition in both atria and assess ATR-induced ERP shortening and AF. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis `OS increases post-ganglionic nerve firing in the atrial GPs, leading to enhanced neurotransmitter release from remodeled/newly sprouted nerves; this helps perpetuate electrical remodeling in ATR'. In this aim, we will assess whether targeted OS inhibition in the GPs of dogs with established AF will attenuate spontaneous GP nerve firing, normalize autonomic responsiveness in the atria and reverse ERP shortening. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis `OS leads to the emergence of IKH (and/or increase in IK1) in atrial myocytes, which helps perpetuate electrical remodeling in ATR.' We will assess whether acute OS inhibition in ATR myocytes decreases IKH/IK1 density and reverses PKC signaling changes that underlie emergence of IKH. In addition, we will assess whether short term NOX2 inhibition in-vivo in atria (excluding the GPs) of ATR dogs with established AF will at least partially reverse ERP shortening/AF."
"9463124","Project Abstract Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic disease of the peripheral lung parenchyma that affects ~0.5% of older adults in the US and carries a median survival time of only 3.8 years. While pirfenidone and nintedanib slow the decline of lung function in IPF, neither drug reverses fibrosis or prevents the ongoing alveolar epithelial cell injury that leads to fibrosis in IPF. The identification of interventions that prevent alveolar epithelial cell injury in IPF would have a paradigm-shifting impact. A recent novel hypothesis suggests that ?tractional? injury in the periphery of the lung may be responsible for the development of IPF. Our central hypothesis is that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which affects up to 88% of adults with IPF, is a prevalent cause of recurrent peripheral tractional stress in the lung that leads to alveolar epithelial cell injury and, in susceptible individuals, lung fibrosis. We believe that the Müeller maneuvers induced during obstructive apneas and hypopneas lead to stretch and injury alveolar epithelial cells, contributing to fibrosis in susceptible adults over the course of 10-20 years. In mice, inspiratory resistive loading (a model of obstructive hypopnea) induces alveolar epithelial cell injury and results in increased alveolar-capillary membrane permeability. In humans, we and others have shown that adults with OSA have higher circulating levels of surfactant protein-A and Krebs von den Lungen-6, markers of alveolar epithelial cell injury, and higher serum matrix metalloproteinase-7 levels, a marker of extracellular matrix remodeling, suggesting that subclinical alveolar epithelial cell injury and extracellular matrix remodeling occurs in OSA in otherwise healthy adults. Alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury is also detectable by measurement of serum surfactant protein-D, and angiopoetin-2, respectively. In IPF, alveolar epithelial cell injury is detectable by elevations in some of these markers, and matrix metalloproteinase-7 levels are a key diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in IPF. We propose to establish OSA as a contributor to alveolar epithelial cell injury in adults with and without IPF, and to obtain data that will inform and justify a phase 2 clinical trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to improve outcomes in adults with IPF and OSA. We will investigate associations between OSA and biomarkers of alveolar epithelial & endothelial cell injury and extracellular matrix remodeling a multi-ethnic population- based cohort of adults who underwent home polysomnography in 2010-2012. We will also investigate whether treatment with CPAP is associated with reductions in serum markers of alveolar epithelial cell injury and extracellular matrix remodeling in adults with OSA both with and without IPF, including measurement of CPAP- induced changes in the proteome of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in adults with IPF. Our study will provide strong evidence for or against a pathogenic role of OSA in IPF, and is likely to provide critical data that we will use to design a phase 2 trial with a high likelihood of successfully identifying a therapeutic effect of CPAP in IPF if one exists."
"9414912","Project Summary/Abstract  The Principal Investigator?s (PI) goal is to be a scientist in an academic setting with a research program focused on understanding adolescent substance use and identifying key targets for prevention efforts. A comprehensive training plan was therefore constructed to systematically advance the PI?s training in: 1) developmentally-relevant risk factors, comorbidity, assessment tools, and sophisticated research related to social anxiety (SA) among youth; 2) developmentally-relevant risk factors, comorbidity, assessment tools, and sophisticated research related to marijuana use among youth; and 3) the development, implementation, analysis, and dissemination of prevention programs that target youth. Importantly, the proposed study is designed to complement the training program by helping the PI to refine relevant research skills while completing an initial test of factors related to adolescent marijuana use.  The proposed sample will include 120 youth (15-17 years) endorsing recent marijuana use. Among adults, SA is positively related to marijuana problems; however, no work has examined this among youth. To address this gap, the proposed study was designed to replicate findings with an adolescent sample in a controlled lab setting. Youth will be randomly assigned to either a peer rejection or neutral cue and then assessed on their degree of willingness to accept a series of simulated marijuana offers. Marijuana use problems, SA, and relevant risk factors will be assessed with continuous self-report measures and structured interviews at baseline. Together, SA and rejection are expected to positively relate to real-time marijuana use willingness and use problems. Marijuana use motives and history also will be examined as potential explanatory mechanisms by which SA and negative responding to rejection may lend to the development of problems.  The proposed project aligns with the strategic plan outlined by the National Institute on Drug Abuse in 3 key ways. First, the aims of the research project are to gain a better understanding of risk for developing marijuana use problems before they occur through the dual examination of individual (e.g., SA) and contextual (e.g., peer rejection) factors in a controlled laboratory setting. Second, the novel application of this work to an adolescent sample ensures that the data from this project will be meaningful for prevention efforts- even if the specified hypotheses are not supported. Indeed, the findings stand to either replicate observations seen with adults or highlight features that differentiate younger, less-experienced users. As such, this study will lay the foundation for future work in this area that can lend to more targeted, and thus more effective, prevention programs. Finally, the project will serve as an important training opportunity for the PI through tailored training in the development of her independent research program targeting prevention-oriented substance use work among adolescents."
"9500834","Project Summary  Because of their elevated frequency, ability to self-renew and rapid acquisition of effector function following re-activation, memory T cells have an enhanced ability to protect from secondary challenge. The generation of memory T cells is the focal point of numerous vaccine and immunotherapeutic strategies. Most (90-95%) effector T cells die after pathogen clearance, but those fated to become memory cells can be identified during the primary effector response, showing that activated T cells receive differentiation cues during the primary response to infection that influence memory fate differentiation. We have recently shown that T cell receptor (TCR) signals play a key role in driving CD4+ memory T cell differentiation. TCRs that are able to engage MHC Class II-bound antigen (pMHCII) in sustained interactions are biased towards the formation of long-lived memory, while TCRs that engage in short-lived interactions with antigen are biased towards terminal effector cell differentiation. We will build on those studies by using diverse infectious models to define aspects of the TCR-dependent activation and transcriptional program that leads to the formation of lymphoid-resident, circulating and tissue-resident CD4+ memory T cells. We pose three key questions. First, what is the role of TCR signal strength in the formation of memory T cells? We will explore the hypothesis that increasing TCR signal strength in vivo drives terminal effector T cell differentiation, while weaker TCR signal strength allows memory T cell formation. Second, what are the TCR binding parameters associated with memory T cell development? We will measure 2D affinity and bond lifetime with the application of force for TCRs at that are effector-biased or memory-biased. We will test the hypothesis that bond lifetimes will predict TCR-dependent memory differentiation. Third, what are the transcriptional programs that control memory formation? We will test the mechanistic role of molecules that are differentially expressed in memory T cell precursors during the primary effector response, including TCF-1. We anticipate that resolution of the questions posed in this study will provide a framework for determining in greater mechanistic detail how memory T cells form and identify therapeutic approaches for directly modulating CD4+ effector and memory T cell differentiation in vivo."
"9467053","PROJECT SUMMARY  Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most prevalent valvular heart disease in the U.S., affecting approximately 1.7% of the population. There are 4.1 million patients in the US with moderate to severe MR requiring treatment. However, only approximately 30,000 patients in the U.S. undergo surgery for MR each year due to concerns about procedural complexity and patient safety. There is great enthusiasm among the heart valve industry and clinicians to develop transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVRep) or replacement (TMVR), offering less invasive treatment options for MR patients. However, after more than a decade of development, the field of transcatheter mitral valve therapy is still in its infancy. Many of the current TMVRep and TMVR devices have dismal clinical results. Current transcatheter treatment methods face serious roadblocks: TMVRep devices are safe but not very effective, while TMVR devices can be effective, but are not yet safe.  In this proposal, Dura Biotech proposes to develop the novel Sutra TMVR system which combines the best aspects of surgical MV replacement, TMVR, and TMVRep approaches to pose an elegant and effective solution for MR. The Sutra TMVR system is delivered and anchored at the mitral annulus in a three-step procedure that closely mimics the surgical valve replacement process with clinically proven long-term efficacy. The implanted Sutra TMVR system replaces the native posterior mitral leaflet with a novel tri-leaflet prosthetic valve that mimics the native posterior mitral leaflet in design and function, to provide predictable and consistent MR reduction. Because the Sutra TMVR system only covers the posterior portion of the MV, it eliminates left ventricular outflow tract obstruction seen commonly with other replacement devices, and enables a smaller device profile for safe, trans-septal access and delivery. The feasibility and short-term efficacy of the Sutra valve via surgical implantation have been demonstrated through in an early proof-of-concept 60-day animal study.  The goal of this SBIR project is to develop and commercialize the novel Sutra TMVR system. To achieve this goal, in Phase 1 of this study we will finalize the Sutra system valve and stent designs through a series of engineering analyses and experimental tests. In Phase 2 of this study we will first perform preclinical animal studies of the Sutra system via transcatheter implantation, then perform verification-and-validation tests on the final Sutra system design, and finally compile the data for Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) submission to the FDA. Successful completion of this project will yield an innovative hybrid TMVR and TMVRep device to treat the largely underserved MR patient population.  "
"9463550","Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a viral agent that causes severe respiratory illness, infects a large percentage of infants and children worldwide by the age of three (E. Heylen et al, 2017). According to the CDC, RSV is responsible for over 50,000 hospitalizations and 2.1 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years as well as 180,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths among the elderly in the US alone (E. K. Miller, et al. 2013). After more than 40 years of research, several RSV vaccine candidates are in the pipeline, but none have progressed through the final approval process. A major target for vaccine development has been guided by the successful prophylactic use of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, palivizumab (SynergisR) which is directed against the fusion glycoprotein (F protein). The treatment is expensive, must be given every 3-6 months for maximum protection, and is currently limited to high-risk young pediatric patients (E. Heylen et al, 2017). Clinical studies with unmodified F protein stimulates some neutralizing antibodies, but also non-neutralizing antibodies. We hypothesize that the non-neutralizing antibodies interfere with the action of neutralizing antibodies and that their elimination may improve the protective immunity stimulated by rationally-designed F variants. Guided by our previous work with HIV, Influenza, HRV, and most recently with RSV, we analyzed structural and immunological data for the F protein RSV to identify and immune dampen non- neutralizing epitopes. In a preliminary study, we designed and produced a panel of immune refocused F antigens and showed that the most promising candidates retained binding to neutralizing antibodies while losing binding to non-neutralizing antibodies. We propose to examine these types of F variants in both pre- and post-fusion conformations for improved protection in a cotton rat challenge study."
"9468194","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  For early diagnosis to lead to early intervention, our diagnostic tools need to provide affordable, accessible, and accurate tests of auditory function in any healthcare setting. As it is, distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) testing provides an objective and noninvasive measure for evaluating the health of a common site of age-related declines in the auditory system ? the outer hair cells. DPOAEs are a familiar tool due to their widespread use in newborn hearing screening and other audiological clinical applications. We contend that the test performance of DPOAEs can be improved significantly by aligning the methods to evoke them with known, place-specific mechanical properties of the mammalian cochlea.  Currently utilized DPOAE measurement protocols are not optimized to detect dysfunction across the entire cochlea, especially those common age-related conditions that first manifest at the very base. Recent advances in calibration techniques and measurement hardware allows for delivery and recording of accurate emission levels up to 20 kHz [14-15]. This proposal tackles the remaining important step by developing a DPOAE test protocol guided by local cochlear mechanical properties and evaluating its test performance. We will use state-of-the art techniques for calibrating the stimulus pressure [64-65] and correcting the DPOAE pressure [45] to compensate for individual variations in ear canal anatomy while concurrently delivering stimuli and recording DPOAEs. The stimulus frequency ratio and stimulus levels will be adjusted in a frequency- specific manner to maximize DPOAE generation and improve test performance for both screening for hearing loss and predicting hearing thresholds. We hypothesize that DPOAE stimulus parameters that are optimized for the cochlear place of stimulation will evoke emissions that accurately reflect cochlear health and therefore will be closely related to behavioral hearing thresholds.  We plan to pursue the following aims: (1) Develop a novel DPOAE measurement protocol optimized to local cochlear mechanical properties, (2) Evaluate the novel DPOAE measurement protocol in detecting the presence of hearing loss, and (3) Apply the novel DPOAE measurement protocol for the prediction of hearing thresholds. Through detailed investigation of physiologically derived characteristics of DPOAEs in young, normal-hearing adults, we expect that DPOAE amplitudes will be significantly correlated with behavioral hearing thresholds in normal-hearing and hearing-impaired individuals.  This proposal leverages the latest developments in calibration and measurement hardware to develop a DPOAE measurement system that is optimized for local cochlear properties. These optimizations are expected to improve DPOAE test performance significantly positioning the new test as an important, affordable, and accessible tool for early detection of age-related cochlear function. The clinical implications are significant as we propose to improve a well-accepted clinical tool that can easily be automated for widespread deployment."
"9432825","Project Summary The hippocampus is crucial for episodic memory, although the mechanisms underlying its contributions are not fully understood. A major obstacle for understanding hippocampal function is the difficulty in linking neural activity to rapidly occurring memory processes that unfold with millisecond time scales. For instance, viewing behavior influences memory formation and retrieval, with ~4 visual fixations on average occurring every second during feats of memory. To address this challenge, the proposed research combines records of viewing behavior obtained via eye-movement tracking with recordings of hippocampal activity from depth electrodes implanted chronically in human subjects for the treatment of epilepsy. This approach yields spatially and temporally precise measurement of hippocampal activity corresponding to the rapid series of visual fixations that occurs during memory formation and retrieval. The primary goal is to identify hippocampal neural activity associated with viewing behavior that reflects novelty detection versus retrieval processes during memory formation. We focus on novelty detection and retrieval because these are two fundamental aspects of hippocampal function that have not been adequately segregated in previous experiments due to their rapid and interactive nature. By linking intracranial recordings of hippocampal neural activity with eye movements that reflect novelty detection versus retrieval in a tightly controlled experimental memory task, the proposed project would advance knowledge of how specific memory functions that occur dynamically during memory formation are supported by the hippocampus. The mechanistic knowledge provided by this proposed research would advance understanding of normal memory function and memory abnormalities in individuals with impairments, including epilepsy and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, establishing relationships between memory-related eye movements and hippocampal function could motivate novel diagnostics for specific hippocampal abnormalities in individuals with memory impairments."
"9454822","Modeling Core Project Summary: Many physical, biological, and social systems display sudden transitions between qualitatively different states. An example is the role of nutrient pollution on aquatic ecosystems: when phosphorus and nitrogen levels increase above a threshold value, a stream, river, or lake can transition from a low biomass/high diversity state to a high biomass/low diversity state. Systems that are history-dependent demonstrate hysteresis and follow so- called S-shaped bifurcation curves. We will approach the modeling of the development of pneumonia and its resolution in response to treatment using the conceptual framework of bifurcation theory. In the simplest case, with only two states, the model would distinguish a state with low bacterial load and high lung function from one with a high bacterial load and low lung function. The major challenge in this framework is to determine how to express the control parameter in terms of biological variables pertinent to pneumonia pathogenesis. We will pursue an agnostic modeling approach to the challenge of obtaining insight from these high-dimensional data. Because of the complexity of the problem, we will iteratively apply a variety of cutting-edge methods from systems biology, data science, dynamical systems, and ecology. By overcoming this challenge, we will achieve two aims. Aim 1. To identify biological variables (both host and pathogen) that will enable us to predict clinical outcomes in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii and other spp. pneumonia. Aim 2. To develop a set of hypotheses on the causal drivers of clinical outcomes that will be validated in subsequent human samples and tested using humanized mouse models. We will use systems biology methods to define low-dimensionality variables from the high-throughput, high-dimensionality data collected. We will then use machine learning, and dynamical systems methods ? with a focus on methods that have demonstrated their mettle in ecological applications ? to identify biomarkers for specific host/microbiome phenotypes and to predict the probability of different clinical outcomes for each phenotype. We will determine which biological variables most contribute to determining the classification by probing the sensitivities of different phenotypes to specific biological variables in order to generate mechanistic hypotheses that will then be tested experimentally with humanized mouse models and validated with human samples."

Developments in time-resolved SAXS will extend available time regimes from 500 ns to seconds with major  reductions in sample consumption, by more than order of magnitude, from current capabilities. This will allow  a much wider range of biomedical problems to be addressed than previously possible.

"9306679","PROJECT SUMMARY Telencephalic GABAergic neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex have central roles in cognition and emotion. Dysfunction of these neurons contributes to some types of epilepsy, intellectual deficiency, autism and schizophrenia. During development, subpallial progenitors generate most of telencephalic GABAergic neurons, including basal ganglia projections neurons and cortical interneurons6. The Dlx1,2,5&6 homeodomain transcription factors (TF) have central roles for this process7-24. Understanding the genetic circuitry upstream and downstream of the DLX TFs is essential for elucidating the basic mechanisms of telencephalic GABAergic development. To elucidate the genetic circuitry driving the development and function of telencephalic GABAergic progenitors and neurons, we must define the TFs, REs (enhancers and promoters) and the coding regions that they control.  We hypothesize that the DLX homeodomain (TF) are at the core of transcriptional circuits, which we call the ?Dlx Pathway?, that regulate the development of most telencephalic GABAergic neurons, including basal ganglia projections neurons and cortical interneurons. We propose experiments aimed at elucidating the network of TFs in the Dlx Pathway that directly regulate genes controlling development of cells generated in the embryonic basal ganglia (ganglionic eminences, GEs). We will use chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by whole genome sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to elucidate in vivo genomic binding sites for TFs upstream and downstream of Dlx1&2 (Aim 1). Analysis of changes in RNA expression in the GEs of Dlx1/2 mutants (Aim 2) will provide evidence for the genes whose expression depends on Dlx function. Histone ChIP-Seq and ATAC- Seq (Aim 3), in conjunction with TF ChIP-Seq, will provide evidence for the locations of regulatory elements (REs; enhancers and promoters) used by Dlx Pathway.

"9600331","PROJECT SUMMARY Increasing evidence has supported a role for chromatin misregulation in the pathogenesis of various human diseases including cancer, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recent tumor genome sequencing efforts have identified inactivating mutations in NSD1, a histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36)-specific methyltransferase, in 10-15% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), the sixth leading cancer worldwide. This study focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which NSD1 inactivation facilitate HNSCC development and will test the central hypothesis that biochemical and genetic inactivation of NSD1 alters DNA methylome and transcriptome to disrupt squamous tissue differentiation and promote HNSCC initiation in vivo. During the mentored training period, I will characterize the biochemical basis and functional importance of NSD1 inhibition by H3 lysine 36 to methionine (H3K36M) mutation, an oncohistone previously associated with pediatric malignancies and identified in HNSCC through my preliminary studies. I will also profile the impact of NSD1 and H3K36M mutations on the genome-wide distribution of H3K36 methylation and DNA methylation as well as on the transcriptome. During the independent phase of the award period, I propose to investigate the function of NSD1 in squamous tissue differentiation and in vivo suppression of HNSCC. Together the proposed studies will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of a subset of genetically defined and epigenetically distinct HNSCC that can translate into improved care for patients. They will also serve as a platform for me to obtain trainings in chemical biology, computational epigenomics and mouse models of cancer that will critically contribute to my career development as an independent investigator in the field of cancer epigenetics.  "
"9448678","This study leverages our leadership in the evaluation of a major World Bank (WB)-funded project in four urban areas of Mozambique. We will test if and how improvements in water supply reduce or delay enteropathogen infection, and impact associated acute and chronic gastrointestinal-related disorders. We take advantage of the randomized allocation of access to a new piped water system, adding novel microbial and health endpoints. This will be the largest water system improvement evaluated using an experimental design and the first to examine the impact of new household water connections on these health outcomes. While improved case treatment has reduced mortality from diarrhea in recent decades, morbidity has persisted, with an estimated four billion diarrhea cases annually worldwide. The deleterious health effects of repeated, cumulative enteric pathogen infections and diarrhea episodes are especially relevant when they occur during the first two years of life. Increasing evidence suggests that early infection with enteric pathogens, even in the absence of diarrhea symptoms, is associated with long-term chronic sequelae, including environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), growth faltering, and cognitive impairment. Studies of WASH interventions often focus on reducing diarrhea, and few have examined specific enteric pathogens, nor long-term gastrointestinal-related sequelae. The study of host-level gastrointestinal conditions, such as gut microbiome composition and EED, may help explain differential acute responses to enteric infections, as well as the downstream consequences of these infections. While there is evidence of differences in gut microbiome composition across different cultures, regions, and populations, to date the environmental determinants of these differences, such as access to piped water, have not been evaluated experimentally, using explicit counterfactuals. More research is needed to understand these relationships and how they are affected by community-level interventions such as water supply provision. We propose to test how provision of piped water to low-income, urban households impacts: (SA1) acute gastrointestinal conditions (enteric pathogen prevalence, diarrhea prevalence); (SA2) chronic gastrointestinal conditions (EED, gut microbiome composition, growth faltering); and (SA3) timing of enteropathogen seroconversion and the association between seroconversion and chronic gastrointestinal conditions. Our multi-disciplinary team has expertise in impact evaluation, enteric diseases, drinking water quality, and metagenomics, as well as extensive experience researching enteric diseases in low-income settings throughout the world. This research will inform decisions on how best to invest resources to provide essential infrastructure to cope with urban growth globally and improve child health, especially for the estimated 1.1 billion people worldwide who lack safe drinking water supplies."
"9447974","ABSTRACT  Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum.  Based on the SMM index developed by CDC that focuses on the most life-­threatening conditions and complications, the prevalence of SMM doubled from 1998-­2011 and currently affects >65,000 women in the U.S. each year.  Maternal health is essential to a woman?s ability to care for her children and to her health over her life course, yet our understanding of causes of SMM is limited.  This proposal addresses three key and understudied areas of research for SMM:  racial/ethnic disparities, maternal weight, and social disadvantage.  Racial/ethnic disparities in SMM and its contributing conditions are well known ? risk of SMM tends to be up to 2-­fold higher among non-­Hispanic blacks and 1.5-­fold higher among Hispanics and Asians, relative to non-­Hispanic whites.  The explanation for these disparities is unknown, but preliminary  evidence suggests that maternal weight and social disadvantage may contribute.  In the U.S., 25% of women are obese at conception, half gain excessive weight during pregnancy, and 25% retain >10 lb. postpartum, but this varies by race-­ethnicity.  Some studies suggest an association of obesity with SMM, but few have  examined severity of obesity, underweight status, or weight change.  Social disadvantage is much more common among non-­whites than whites and associated with myriad perinatal outcomes, but almost no studies have examined its contribution to SMM.  Unusually high and low maternal weight and weight gain are most likely among socially disadvantaged women, but their inter-­related impacts on SMM have not been studied.  Our goal is to increase understanding of biologic and social determinants of SMM and its racial/ethnic disparities, by analyzing 4 million births that occurred in California from 2007-­2014.  The data include vital records and mother and infant hospital discharge data from pregnancy through postpartum.  Outcomes will include the most common conditions that contribute to SMM ? postpartum hemorrhage, eclampsia/severe preeclampsia, select cardiovascular conditions, and sepsis ? as well as the SMM index developed by CDC.   The Specific Aims are: 1) Examine associations of maternal weight status before, during, and between  pregnancies with SMM and whether they are modified by race/ethnicity;? 2) Examine associations of multi-­level (individual, household, neighborhood) indicators of social disadvantage with SMM, overall and by race/ethnicity (Aim 2a), and the extent to which these relationships are mediated by maternal weight status (Aim 2b);? and 3) Investigate the contribution of maternal weight status and social disadvantage to the population burden of SMM and its racial/ethnic disparities. The proposed research will break new ground by studying the complex relationships among maternal weight, social disadvantage, racial/ethnic disparities, and SMM. This knowledge is essential to the development of effective public health and clinical interventions to reduce SMM and its  disparities, including guidelines for maternal weight.     "
"9613497","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human and nonhuman primates communicate with conspecifics using vocalizations. For communication in this medium to be successful, listeners must be able to recognize vocal signals (e.g. words for humans) and parse them from the plethora of other biotic and abiotic sounds in the acoustic environment. Rather than be the culmination of vocal signal recognition, identifying species-specific acoustic signals is only one part of a more complex process. Like other objects, vocal signals comprise a number of categories that reflect social dimensions of the caller, such as individual identity, sex, dialect, etc. These social categories are encoded in the acoustic structure of the vocalization due to idiosyncrasies in the caller's voice and are known to be perceptually meaningful in both human and nonhuman primate vocal interactions. While the neural basis of speech recognition has been extensively studied using various neuroimaging techniques and patients, much less is known about its underlying cellular mechanisms. Given similarities in vocal perception and homologies in the auditory system neuroanatomy, nonhuman primates represent an excellent model for explicating the neural mechanisms underlying vocal signal recognition in primate neocortex. Nearly all earlier neural studies of vocalization processing in nonhuman primate cortex involve experiments in which vocalization exemplars are presented to restrained animals. Communication, however, is an inherently interactive process involving the exchange of signals between conspecifics. The aim of this proposal is to examine vocal signal recognition in naturally behaving common marmosets while they engage in antiphonal calling, a vocal behavior characterized by the reciprocal exchange of vocalizations. Since marmosets will only produce an antiphonal call in response to a particular call type, this behavior represents a natural (i.e. untrained) recognition system and is uniquely suited to explore the neural basis of social categorization during natural communication for the following three reasons. First, previous work shows that social categories of callers affect the dynamics of antiphonal calling. Second, we developed novel, interactive playback software that allows us to elicit this vocal response under experimental conditions. And third, we can record the activity of single neurons in marmoset prefrontal cortex while subjects are freely-moving. These three components represent a potentially powerful approach to addressing the three aims of this proposal. Specific Aim 1 is to combine single-unit neurophysiology and histology to characterize the functional neuroanatomy of marmoset frontal cortex for vocal communication. This aim will establish a foundation for all subsequent physiology, both in this proposal and further in the future. Specific Aim 2 seeks to extensively test the perceptual basis of social categorization by presenting subjects with synthetically manipulated vocalizations. Specific Aim 3 builds on the preceding aims of this proposal by testing the neural basis of social categorization during antiphonal calling using the neuroanatomical locations of Aim 1 and the perceptual findings of Aim 2."
"9568879","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital CMV infection (cCMV) is the most common congenital infection and a leading non-genetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss worldwide. The birth prevalence of cCMV is directly proportional to maternal CMV seroprevalence levels, with substantially higher rates observed in highly seropositive populations. Increased rates of cCMV are observed in African populations, with evidence for a key role for maternal co-infections, such as HIV, as a driver of cCMV in these countries. Despite a high burden of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa, the impact of maternal HIV on the frequency of in utero CMV transmission, symptomatic infection at birth and long-term sequelae has not been systematically evaluated. We recently conducted the first study of cCMV birth prevalence among HIV-exposed newborns in the Western Cape, South Africa, and demonstrated a high rate of cCMV (2.93%; 95% CI 1.73-4.13) in the era of prenatal antiretroviral prophylaxis. Infant CMV infection has been widely associated with an increased risk of HIV disease progression and mortality, as well as an adverse impact on growth, development and overall morbidity in HIV-exposed but uninfected Zambian infants. These findings suggest that CMV infection (intrauterine or postnatal acquisition) has an adverse impact on overall childhood morbidity and mortality in children not infected with HIV. We hypothesize that maternal HIV infection increases the risk of intrauterine CMV transmission, and predisposes CMV-infected infants to adverse outcomes even in the era of option B. The proposed study will provide reliable estimates of the birth prevalence of congenital CMV infection in HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed newborns in sub-Saharan Africa in the context of triple antiretroviral therapy, as well as preliminary data on the frequency and timing of postnatal CMV acquisition during infancy and the impact of CMV infection acquired in infancy on childhood morbidity. In this study, we will screen ~4,200 newborns at the Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital, a regional hospital that provides subsidized health care where 40% of pregnant women are HIV-infected. Newborn CMV screening will be carried out by testing dried saliva specimens using a real-time PCR method developed in our laboratory. Hearing screening of infants and diagnostic audiology testing protocols will be implemented to determine the prevalence of CMV-associated hearing loss. The objectives of the study are: 1) To determine the birth prevalence of congenital CMV infection among HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed newborns, 2) To determine the prevalence of newborn disease and CMV-associated sequelae in HIV-exposed and unexposed newborns with congenital CMV infection, and 3) To explore the impact of CMV infection (both congenital and postnatal) on overall childhood morbidity and mortality. The proposed studies take advantage of the experience, expertise and commitment of the investigative team with similar interests and motivation to determine the impact of maternal HIV infection on in utero transmission of CMV, CMV-associated hearing loss and whether CMV infection acquired in early infancy affects overall childhood morbidity."

We propose to develop technologies in four areas: 1) To identify different protein variants or isoforms. 2) To quantify proteins by mass spectrometry with a focus on determining absolute levels of a protein. 3) To study how protein variation affects protein function. 4) To determine the structures of protein complexes not amenable to high-resolution methods such as x-ray crystallography and NMR."
"9607902","PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT):  Background: The identification of FTO as the first N6-methyladenosine RNA demethylase have spurred immense interest in study of the regulatory functions of m6A modifications. Despite the critical impacts of the m6A modifications in various fundamental biological processes, the function (and molecular mechanism) of FTO in cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), has yet to be studied. AML is one of the most common and fatal forms of hematopoietic malignancies. Despite the improved risk stratifications and treatment- adapted strategies, >70% of AML patients cannot survive over 5 years due to drug resistance. Thus, it is critical to better understand molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis and drug response of AML, which may lead to the development of effective novel therapeutic strategies to treat AML. Our data suggest that FTO likely plays a critical oncogenic role in the pathogenesis of MLL-rearranged AML and in drug response of t(15;17) AML. We show that FTO is highly expressed in AMLs carrying t(11q23)/MLL-rearrangements, t(15;17), NPM1 mutations and/or FLT3-ITD, namely FTO-high AMLs, which are more sensitive to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and/or arsenic trioxide (ATO) treatment than the other AML subtypes. ATRA/ATO-based differentiation therapy has transformed t(15;17) AML from a highly fatal disease to a highly curable one. However, the role of FTO and the underlying molecular mechanism in the pathogenesis and drug response of FTO-high AMLs are elusive.  Objective/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that FTO, as a major m6A eraser, plays a critical role in both pathogenesis and drug response of FTO-high AMLs through epigenetically regulating expression of its targets.  Specific Aims: (1) To determine the role of FTO in both development and maintenance of FTO-high AMLs; (2) To identify critical direct targets of FTO and the regulatory mechanism(s) in FTO-high AMLs; and (3) To determine the role and underlying mechanism of FTO in the response of FTO-high AMLs to ATRA and/or ATO treatment.  Study Design: 1) We will use the Fto knockout model coupled with mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) leukemia models to investigate the pathological function of FTO in both development and maintenance of various subtypes of FTO-high AMLs and in the self-renewal of relevant leukemia stem/initiating cells (LSCs/LICs). 2) We will identify critical direct target genes of FTO by integrating m6A distribution data with FTO-RNA interaction data, and will decipher the molecular mechanism(s) by which FTO post-transcriptionally regulates expression of its direct target genes, followed by functional studies of the top candidate targets of FTO in the pathogenesis of FTO-high AMLs. 3) We will use both mouse BMT leukemia models and patient- derived xeno-transplantation models to determine the role and underlying molecular mechanism of FTO in the response of FTO-high AMLs to ATRA and/or ATO treatment. The critical target genes of FTO and relevant pathways that are responsible for the response of FTO-high AMLs to ATRA and/or ATO treatment will be identified."
"9420471","The goal of this fellowship is to prepare the applicant, April Joy G. Damian, for an academic research career focused on improving access of urban youth with histories of childhood adversities to treatment and social support systems that promote healthy coping and social-emotional functioning. To that end, the proposed fellowship consists of two complementary components: 1) a research project evaluating knowledge, attitudes, and behavior outcomes, including referral rates, associated with the Baltimore City Health Department Trauma-Informed Care (BCHD TIC) Initiative; and 2) a training plan comprised of formal coursework, mentorship, and didactic as well as professional development activities. The Specific Aims of the research project are to conduct a prospective cohort study, using preexisting quantitative data gathered from 120 individuals (ages 18 to 65 years) and qualitative data from 30 individuals (ages 18 to 65 years) from youth- serving government agencies and nonprofit organizations being trained in the BCHD TIC Initiative, to examine one year pre-post changes in: 1) self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about trauma services, and professional quality of life, of agency personnel; 2) organizational- and provider-level factors associated with implementation of trauma-informed care from the perspective of agency personnel (assessed via the organizational TIC self-assessments; SAMHSA, 2014); and, 3) referral rates of traumatized youth to appropriate services. This study marks the first formal scientific assessment of the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) trauma-informed care training model, despite growing implementation throughout the U.S. One explanation for the proliferation of TIC trainings nationwide, even in the face of limited evidence, is the growing understanding of the high prevalence of adverse childhood experiences, and the limited mental health services and resources for individuals with a history of childhood trauma. Building evidence around the BCHD TIC initiative has important implications for improving outcomes for this population, who face numerous negative short- and long-term outcomes. Evidence gathered from this study will also be critical to substantiate funding for a future multisite randomized controlled trial of the BCHD TIC Initiative in other urban U.S. cities. This project is supported by a strong interdisciplinary mentorship team with expertise in trauma-informed interventions, positive youth development, implementation science, and mixed methods, and will take place in a world class research department and institution. The proposed fellowship will also provide Ms. Damian with the coursework, didactic opportunities, and professional relationships that she requires to progress to the next stage of her career as an independent researcher. Both the training plan and research project will prepare Ms. Damian to achieve her career objective of improving and evaluating trauma-informed service systems to support healthy youth development in communities with high rates of trauma exposure, consistent with the NICHD Scientific Vision: The Next Decade goals."
"9402035","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Thousands patients with end-staged liver failure die every year world-wide due to the lack of donor livers. Our long-term goal is to improve the usage of the livers from older donors to ameliorate the shortage of donor livers. Toward this goal, we have found that by treating old mice with ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) protocol, we can restore the regenerative capability in the livers of 24-month old mice, the equivalent of 70-year old humans. Based on these results, we hypothesized that old hepatocytes, once reactivated by GABA, can readily regenerate in response to a mitogenic stimulus. We will test our hypothesis in the following specific aims: (1) Identify that hepatocytes in the livers of GABA-treated aged mice readily regenerate within 6 h to 8 h in addition to the improved regeneration at the usual 36 h following mitogenic stimulus; (2) Identify GABA-A and -B receptors and their individual roles in hepatocellular reactivation providing impetus for hepatocyte regeneration in livers of aged mice; we will use selective agonists and antagonists and hepatocellular specific genetic deletion of each receptor type in delineating the role and contribution of the receptors to liver regeneration in aged mice; (3) To corroborate that the unused livers from human donors, after being treated with GABA, will have augmented ability to regenerate upon mitogenic stimulus. The rationale for the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms by which GABA makes old hepatocytes functionally young again which will provide a mechanism-based foundation of safety and usefulness of GABA as we translate this knowledge clinically to make aged livers becoming usable donor livers. The results from the proposed work will improve the liver-related health and will effectively expand donor pool for transplantation."
"9513291","Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of this research is to identify the neural mechanisms by which attention and changes in context in?uence the interpretation of sounds. In its simplest form, sound interpretation requires linking acoustic signals to behavioral responses. The objective of this proposal is to de- termine the contribution of distinct auditory pathways to sound-driven choices. This research will employ the mouse as a model organism and use genetic tools to identify speci?c cell populations according to their projection patterns. The ?rst aim will test whether auditory thalamic and cortical circuits provide distinct acoustic information to basal ganglia regions involved in action selection. The second aim will identify the acoustic features represented by neurons from distinct basal gan- glia pathways. The third aim will test whether these neurons represent the meaning of a stimulus in addition to its acoustic features. The proposal is innovative not only in its use of genetic tools for the characterization of auditory pathways, but also in its evaluation of the role of auditory thalamic outputs to the basal ganglia. Moreover, these studies will help establish the mouse as an effective model for the study of auditory cognition, opening new avenues for detailed investigation of the neural basis of sound-driven behaviors. The proposed research is signi?cant because it addresses es- sential steps towards identifying neural sites where context and sensory information are integrated to achieve ?exible decision-making. This knowledge will greatly advance understanding of the neu- ral mechanisms underlying sound interpretation, and provide insights into how auditory cognition is affected by disease."
"9528045","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease afflicting millions of people showing increased incidence over the past decade. This T cell-mediated disease in allergic asthma is typically thought of as a type 2/Th2 disease, yet precisely how the environmental antigens that trigger asthma initiate Th2 cell development in the lung is unknown. In this application, we describe Blimp-1 as an unexpected regulator of allergen-induced airway inflammation that is critical to promote Th2 cell development in the lung and subsequent airway inflammation. Blimp-1 is a transcriptional repressor that is pleiotropically expressed by effector T cells, and whose role is to regulate effector T cell responses and constrain T cell-mediated autoimmunity. Our recently published work (Science Immunology 2016) has demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 acting through STAT3 is sufficient to induce Blimp-1 in Th2 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we propose that another STAT3-activating cytokine, IL-6, previously shown to promote allergic experimental asthma downstream of c-kit on dendritic cells, induces Blimp-1 in Th2 cells to initiate Th2 cell development by a hitherto unappreciated mechanism involving effects on Bcl6 and GATA-3, which in turn promotes allergic airway inflammation. We will test our hypothesis in two aims. We will test the prediction that 1) STAT3 is a critical proximal signal that regulates Blimp-1 in Th2 cells during allergic airway disease to suppress Bcl6 and upregulate GATA-3 in T cells, and 2)  Blimp-1 is an essential transcriptional regulator that drives pathological Th2 cells during allergic airway inflammation. These studies will elucidate a paradoxical role of Blimp-1 in T cells to either promote or constrain effector T cell responses depending on the context and potentially uncover a novel mechanism linking IL-6 to induction of Th2 cells through expression of Blimp-1. Besides its role in Th2 differentiation, GATA-3 also has an essential role in thymic T cell development, therefore targeting GATA-3 can be expected to have broad effects. The present study is significant because of its potential to establish a novel therapeutic target, Blimp-1, to specifically blunt Th2 cell generation and disease without being broadly immunosuppressive."
"9403992","Project Summary Frailty is a common clinical condition in which older adults are at high risk for falls, disability, hospitalization, and death. Approximately, 10% of adults 65 years or older are frail and 42% are prefrail with high risk of progressing to frailty. Current screening for frailty hinges on infrequent o?ce visits and a patient's report of symptoms, which often fail to detect subtle decline. Impaired physical function is a major indicator of frailty. However, clinical evaluations do not adequately re?ect daily life functional performance. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of our HOME system to continuously measure functional mobility for 7 days in older people. We have shown that HOME measures are more sensitive than gait in the clinic to indicate physical health status and future falls. In this Phase II, we aim to determine if HOME can better identify geriatric health (frailty) as well as fall risk. We will prepare HOME for a commercial launch as the ?rst continuous monitoring system to help clinicians and clinical researchers identify frailty status and fall risk and determine the e?cacy of interventions on actual functional performance in real life. Our speci?c aims are: AIM I. Clinical Research: Demonstrate the clinical utility of HOME in identifying frailty status and fall risk. AIM II. Technology Development: Prepare HOME for clinical practice and FDA 510(k) clearance to clinical market. We will develop an instrumented, lightweight ankle wrap (SmartSox) with inertial sensors for continuous gait and turning monitoring, expand our Mobility Exchange clinical data management system to facilitate access to mobility data and generate clinical reports, and complete the HOME validation and veri?cation."
"9377490","Project Summary  Projections carrying somatosensory information converge upon several nuclei within the auditory system. While the exact function of these connections is unknown, they can contribute to and modify the pathological sound percepts present in tinnitus patients. Though current treatments attempt to exploit these pathways to ameliorate tinnitus symptoms, very little is known about the their anatomy and physiology. The lateral cortex of the inferior colliculus is one such auditory structure that receives heavy input from both brainstem and cortical somatosensory nuclei. Though this structure has long been implicated in multisensory integration, the termination patterns of inputs to the lateral cortex are segregated into distinct streams: the somatosensory inputs target areas of high-density GAD67 staining, known as modules, while the auditory inputs terminate in extramodular areas. Given this mismatch between functional and anatomical data, the goal of this proposal is to reveal the circuitry and mechanisms underlying multisensory convergence in the lateral cortex. Two main hypotheses will be explored: 1) cells within modular and extramodular regions of the lateral cortex communicate with one another, potentially producing multisynaptic multisensory convergence, and 2) the dendrites of individual cells in modular or extramodular regions extend into the complementary region, thus receiving both auditory and somatosensory input. These hypotheses will be tested in brain slices from the GAD67-GFP mouse, in which modules can be visualized under blue light. Cells in modular and extramodular regions of the lateral cortex will be recorded from and potential presynaptic partners throughout the structure will be stimulated using laser photostimulation of caged glutamate. Inhibitory and excitatory input maps will be constructed to determine whether inputs for a given cell arise from modular areas, extramodular areas, or both. The degree of communication between cells in modular and extramodular areas will be quantified. To further explore the functional differences between modular and extramodular areas, the amount of spontaneous inhibitory and excitatory input to cells in both regions will be determined. To ascertain whether individual cells integrate both somatosensory and auditory information, somatosensory projections from the dorsal column nuclei will be pre-labeled with a red-shifted opsin, C1V1. This pathway will be stimulated with a green laser, and the auditory pathway from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus will be stimulated via laser uncaging with a UV laser. The synaptic properties of each pathway will be examined; if cells responding to both stimuli are found, the interstimulus interval will be systematically altered to determine the effect of timing on the bimodal response. The experiments outlined above will further characterize the somatosensory inputs and intrinsic circuitry of the lateral cortex, which could have important implications for both normal and pathological hearing. Furthermore, these experiments may reveal generalizable principles regarding integration of multisensory inputs at the level of a single cell."
"9516140","Project Summary/Abstract:  Small vessel cerebrovascular disease is a major risk factor in Alzheimer?s disease. However, quantitative biomarkers that are suitable for use as endpoints in clinical trials for these conditions are still lacking. The goals of the present project are to 1) in the UH2 phase, evaluate and identify MRI-based microvascular biomarkers that are diagnostic and predictive, with a particular focus on a novel marker referred to as cerebrovascular reactivity; 2) in the UH3 phase, work with the Coordinating Center and other projects in the consortium to further evaluate the most promising biomarker candidates in a multi-site setting.  Conventional anatomic imaging (e.g. T2-FLAIR) can identify white matter hyperintensities that represent the consequence of small vessel damage. In this project, we will emphasize several newer techniques that probe the potential physiological driving force of small vessel cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Specifically, we will focus on a marker indexing the dynamic coupling capacity of the neurovascular unit, referred to here as cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). Our previously studies on CVR have revealed that: 1) CVR is three times as sensitive to age as resting perfusion. 2) CVR is diminished in patients with AD dementia. 3) Decline in processing speed (over four years) is significantly associated with CVR decline (over four years). 4) CVR of the brain is strongly correlated with structural lesions as seen on T2-FLAIR. Therefore, the present project will emphasize the development of CVR MRI as a small vessel imaging biomarker, with additional consideration of several other microvascular parameters including microbleeds count and cerebral blood flow (CBF). These small vessel measures (vascular imaging markers) will be combined into a composite index based on their contributions to cognitive impairment, which will form a composite imaging biomarker for diagnosis, prediction, and target engagement of VCID.  Our Specific Aims in the UH2 phase are: 1) Examine the association between cognitive function and candidate vascular imaging markers in a group of elderly individuals with mixed vascular and Alzheimer?s pathology; 2) Conduct technical assessment of the vascular imaging methods to show that they are multi-site ready in terms of applicability and reproducibility; 3) Work with Coordinating Center and other Development Projects to establish the consortium in preparation for the UH3 phase. Quantifiable milestones have been defined for these aims and for the readiness of the project to enter the UH3 phase, in which the specific aim is to perform collaborative studies as part of the small vessel biomarker consortium to further evaluate and develop the most promising biomarker candidates.  Impact: Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed a small vessel imaging biomarker that is ready for large scale multi-site clinical validation studies."
"9464824","One of the most common and distressing symptoms of menopause are hot flashes. Hot flashes and related symptoms represent a significant unmet, worldwide, healthcare need, not only in women after surgical or natural menopause, but also in breast and prostate cancer patients undergoing hormone suppression or ablation. Hot flashes occur in 65 ? 90% of women undergoing natural menopause and approximately 70 million individuals worldwide seek therapy each year. A hot flash is a sudden feeling of warmth that is generally most intense over the face, neck and chest as well as peripheral vasodilation leading to flush (reddening of the skin). The duration is variable but averages about 4 minutes. It is often accompanied by sweating. Although not life- threatening, hot flashes can have a detrimental effect on a woman's functional ability and quality of life. The physiological mechanisms leading to a hot flash episode are not known. Similarly, it is not known how the decreasing hormone levels that occur during the menopause transition lead to increased incidence of hot flashes and related symptoms. The only approved therapies for hot flashes are hormone therapy (HT) and a low dose form of paroxetine, an anti-depressant. HT is associated with severe health risks including development of heart disease, cancer, stroke and dementia. Paroxetine use is associated with suicidal thoughts and ideation as well as addiction. While there are no other FDA-approved alternatives, physicians often prescribe other anti-depressants, anti-psychotic agents and pain medications, all of which have significant side effects. Seeking less dangerous alternatives, many women turn to alternative therapies including nutraceuticals and acupuncture but none of these have proven to be effective in placebo-controlled trials. An effective, non-hormonal, non-anti-depressant, treatment for hot flashes and related vasomotor symptoms would be a welcome, novel and useful treatment modality. MenoGeniX is repurposing a naturally occurring human protein called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to treat hot flashes based on placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial data which showed that a single administration of G-CSF can lead to a rapid and significant reduction in hot flash frequency and severity in women with naturally-occurring and surgically-induced menopause. Women with surgically-induced menopause as well as African-American women responded especially well. In this phase 1 SBIR application, MenoGeniX is proposing a placebo- controlled, dose-range finding, phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of G-CSF administered monthly to treat menopausal hot flashes. With a good safety record when used chronically to treat neutropenia, G-CSF may represent a valuable alternative for women with bothersome, moderate to severe hot flashes who are unwilling or unable to take HT or anti-depressants."
"9465967","Abstract: Clostridium difficile is responsible for more than 29,000 deaths in the US each year and the infection represents an urgent threat to public health worldwide. Of most concern is that the incidence of C. difficile infection (CDI) and disease severity is rapidly increasing in recent years due to the emergence of hypervirulent and antibiotic-resistant strains. CDI is mainly caused by two major toxins TcdA and TcdB, and toxin- neutralizing antibodies (antitoxins) are responsible for effective immunity. Therefore, it is important to measure host antitoxin responses since such information will be crucial for assisting physicians to predict CDI progression and recurrence, as well as to guide the use of antibody-based therapeutics. However, current assays to measure patient antitoxin responses are based on serum inhibition of toxins? biological activities on cultured cells; such assays are time consuming, laborious, and difficult to standardize. We aim to develop a serological ELISA for predicting protective immunity against primary and recurrent CDI in patients. This will help clinical management of CDI and also may be used as a companion diagnostic for passive and active immunotherapies. We have identified a broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) N3 and established a N3-based competition ELISA in that CDI patient sera were assayed for inhibiting the binding of biotinylated N3 to TcdB. We found that those sera with high neutralizing anti-TcdB titers are also significantly more potent in inhibiting N3 binding to TcdB than sera with low neutralizing titers. In this project, we will identify additional bNAbs from a panel of anti-TcdB neutralizing antibodies we have developed and evaluate the bNAbs-based ELISA in 240 banked serum samples from CDI patients. Our ultimate goal is to develop a simple serological ELISA screen for antitoxin protective immunity, and thus help the clinical management of CDI and assist the future use of passive and active immunotherapies against this debilitating disease."
"9434347","ABSTRACT  The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common cause of respiratory failure in critically ill patients, with nearly 200,000 cases per year in the US alone and mortality rates of 30-40%. Clinical trials of novel pharmacotherapies in ARDS have met with nearly ubiquitous failure, a dismal track record which has been attributed at least in part to the considerable clinical and biological heterogeneity within this syndrome. With this strong evidence of significant clinical and biological heterogeneity and a major need for new therapies to improve poor clinical outcomes, ARDS is a ripe target for the application of precision medicine, yet little has been done to move from our current one-size-fits-all approach to ARDS clinical care and trials to a more targeted and personalized approach.  We recently identified and validated the presence of two distinct subphenotypes (also known as ?endotypes?) of ARDS in four large randomized controlled trials. In an independent analysis of all four datasets, there was strong evidence for two different endotypes within ARDS: a hyper-inflammatory endotype and a hypo-inflammatory endotype. These endotypes had strikingly different (1) clinical characteristics, (2) biomarker profiles, (3) clinical outcomes, and (4) treatment responses. Most notably, significant endotype- specific treatment responses were identified within three clinical trials previously thought to be ?negative.? While these data are highly promising, we have only a basic understanding of the biology of these endotypes, of the full range of differential treatment responses they exhibit, of the impact of environmental exposures on endotypes, and of how best to translate this growing knowledge base into practical tools for application at the bedside and in clinical trials. In this application, we describe a research program that brings together expertise in molecular phenotyping of critical illness, environmental exposures assessment, advanced statistical approaches to analysis of complex multi-dimensional data, an experimental human lung model of ARDS, and access to clinical trial networks and diverse heterogeneous patient cohorts, in order to determine the optimal approach to applying precision therapeutics in human ARDS.  This program has the potential to be paradigm-shifting by developing practical models for personalized medicine for patients with ARDS, targeted to the biology of an individual patient's disease, with a significant impact on both clinical trials and ultimately clinical care. In addition, these studies will have a high impact via identification of endotype-specific therapeutic responses in completed and ongoing ARDS clinical trials and by improving our understanding of the diverse biology of human ARDS, enhancing the likelihood that successful new therapeutics will be identified for each endotype. Finally, this program will develop a framework by which the principles of precision medicine can be applied to the fast-paced, rapidly evolving setting of critical care medicine."
"9413193","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The proposed Phase III study follows a promising Phase I/II double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of CoQ10 in 46 veterans with Gulf War illness (GWI) who met both the Kansas and CDC case definitions who were treated with 100mg or 300mg of a high bioavailability CoQ10 (ubiquinone) product or placebo. The study, performed by Dr. Beatrice Golomb and her team at the San Diego VA, found a significant improvement in men with GWI vs. placebo using their selected primary outcome variable, the general self-rated health, in a sex-stratified analysi which showed a response in men with GWI, but less so in the 7 women included in the study. The investigators concluded that CoQ10 conferred benefit to physical function and symptoms in Veterans with GWI and that examination in a larger sample was warranted. Since there is currently little to offer GWI that is evidence based, it is a stated VA research priority to move promising Phase II work to Phase III study; thus, initiating a Phase III treatment trial of CoQ10 a this time is of the utmost importance to providing some relief to ailing GW Veterans. A double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-site trial with 200 Veterans with GWI is proposed with sufficient men and women in the sample to perform sex stratification analyses. The clinical and laboratory testing will be performed without knowledge of the subjects' group membership, drug or placebo condition, and will remain blinded throughout the study until its conclusion. The subject schedule includes 5 on-site assessments which include the screening visit with informed consent, the drug initiation visit, an 8 week visit and 16 and 24 week visits, with collection of blood, saliva, and urine and neurocognitive testing. In addition, there is a web-based self-report assessment given every 4 weeks throughout the treatment period and at 4 weeks after completion of the study drug. Subjects will also utilize an activity monitor device to assess activity and sleep throughout the study period through 7 months. The primary analysis to evaluating the efficacy of CoQ10 in GWI will compare treatment groups on SF-36 physical function score over time in a repeated measures setting using a two-sided 0.05 level of significance. Other clinical efficacy end points will be the self-report assessment measures across the domains of fatigue, pain, sleep, and the SF36 subscales of function and severity. Objective measures will include neurocognitive testing, activity data, and laboratory data that could reasonably be considered a surrogate for illness severity (e.g. measures of immune activation, inflammation, and cell function). In addition to the primary objective (efficacy and safety of ubiquinol in GWI), this stuy will offer a platform for the much needed analysis of outcome variables in a well characterized longitudinal cohort, both biomarkers and clinical measures will be analyzed for their utility in future studies. We will also have developed the framework of a much needed clinical trials group for future studies of GWI. If the study proves efficacy, the clinical trials group will work with the VHA to add ubiquinol to the national formulary and update GWI care guidelines. Research findings will be disseminated to key decision-makers, including both the clinical and research leadership of the VA. The medical, academic, and research communities will be reached directly through traditional means of dissemination through publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at national conferences as well as updates to Veteran groups and to policymakers who have an interest in the health of GW Veterans."
"9520701","Project Summary/Abstract  The innate immune system employs germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors to survey the extra- and intra-cellular milieu for the presence of invading microbial or danger signals and mount appropriate defense responses. Inflammasomes, the multiprotein complexes assembled in the cytosol in response to microbial and endogenous danger signals, have emerged as a central component of the innate immune surveillance system. Once assembled inflammasomes proteolytically activate caspase-1, which in turn induces cell death and production of IL-1? and IL-18. Most recently a noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway was identified that is activated by LPS that enters the cytosol via outer membrane vesicles during infection with Gram-negative bacteria such as Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Cytosolic LPS binds and activates an inflammatory caspase, caspae-11, which then mediates cell death, caspase-1 activation and downstream IL-1 cytokine production. Inflammasomes, including the caspase-11-mediated noncanonical inflammasome, play a crucial role in the clearance of infectious agents via pyroptotic and IL-1 responses. A strong selection pressure from the host such as this drives pathogens to develop strategies to actively antagonize or evade innate immune responses. However, little is known about regulation of caspase-11- mediated noncanonical inflammasome by bacterial pathogens. This project will address this knowledge gap and will focus on examining the modulation of noncanonical inflammasome by bacteria utilizing EHEC as a model organism. The studies proposed in the three specific aims of this project will systematically characterize how two bacterial virulence factors inhibit the noncanonical inflammasome and determine the underlying mechanisms. Identifying the mechanisms by which pathogenic bacteria silence noncanonical inflammasome is crucial as it may aid in designing novel therapeutic approaches against Gram-negative infections."
"9405015","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The BioCAT Biotechnology Research Resource operates X-ray beamline 18ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Now in its 20th year of operation, it is a mature, productive facility with many capabilities uniqu in the USA, and, arguably, the world. Going forward, we intend to maintain our world-class capabilities in static, time- and spatially-resolved fiber diffraction with beamline enhancements for increased flux and beam quality. A novel high speed, high sensitivity, high spatial resolution pixel array detector will provide an excellent match to the needs of our muscle diffraction program. Also proposed is a versatile micro-diffraction/micro-SAXS instrument that can use one of two Compound Refractive Lenses optimized for either wide- or small-angle fiber crystallography, and continuous flow SAXS experiments. We will implement multimodal scanning micro-diffraction, x-ray florescence microscopy, phase contrast and uv/visible imaging that can be done either singly or in combination with the same instrument on the same samples.     Developments in time-resolved SAXS will extend available time regimes from 500 ns to seconds with major reductions in sample consumption, by more than order of magnitude, from current capabilities. This will allow a much wider range of biomedical problems to be addressed than previously possible. A new beamline data acquisition and control system will provide a common interface and better data management for all experiments and advanced support for time resolved experiments. Combined refractive index, dynamic light scattering and multi-angle light scattering measurements with SAXS will offer more comprehensive sample characterization on-line for more robust results. A multi-scale modeling effort will allow extracting more information from muscle X-ray diffraction studies. The proposed developments in multi-scale simulations for interpreting single molecule SAXS data will profoundly benefit studies of"
"9320745","Our understanding of the biology of the innate immune systems is rapidly expanding. We are gaining an increasing understanding of the receptors expressed by NK cells that specifically mediate the inhibition and activation of these cells, as well as the ligands for these receptors. It is becoming clear that innate immune signals can dramatically modulate adaptive immune response. Emerging data are implicating NK cells and Other innate immune responses in the early control of HIV-1 replication during primary infection. The recent demonstration that it is possible to generate memory responses in the innate immune system raises the possibility that it may be feasible to use vaccines to enhance anti-viral innate immunity to help terminate or control very early HIV-1 infection. We will explore this possibility in the following aims:    Aim 1. Recombinant canary-pox elicited innate responses and their contribution to shaping adaptive immune responses in rhesus monkeys  Aim 2. Vaccination with KIR ligands for induction of immunologic memory for innate NK cell responses in rhesus monkeys and humans  Aim 3. CD8+ T cell-produced factors and control of viremia The information gained in these studies about the anti-SIV and anti-HIV protective capacity of innate immune responses will lead directly to advances in vaccine design."
"9414911","Abstract 48,960 new cases of pancreatic cancer were predicted for 2015 and despite extensive treatment options, the 5 year relative survival rate has consistently remained below 8% for the past 40 years. Current treatments are non- targeted agents with inherent side effects and only prolong survival on the order of months. Kras is mutated in over 90% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common type of pancreatic cancer. Under normal conditions, Kras is a tightly regulated signaling protein that can toggle between active and inactive states to control cell proliferation. Mutated Kras (G12D) predominantly remains active, thus, constitutively promoting proliferation and tumorigenesis. Studies that target downstream pathways of Kras, Raf/ERK and PI3K/AKT, have had some preclinical success but minimal clinical impact on pancreatic cancer. Therefore, it remains possible that other undiscovered protein-protein interactions exist, including transient ones. This study aims to identify such interactions via cutting edge proteomics technique, BioID (a promiscuous biotin ligase). Firstly, BioID fusions to wild type and mutant Kras will be expressed in mouse tumor cells and human pancreas cell lines to differentially label local proteins, and thus identify context specific interactors of Kras. The relative amounts of proteins will be measured using mass spectrometry and western blot analysis. Preliminary data in murine cells reveal that Rab42 is a major Kras effector. Secondly, depletion experiments of this protein of interest will be performed to study the role of Rab42 in proliferation, transformative potential, EGF dependency, tumorigenesis, and invasive potential in vitro. The role of Rab42 in tumor initiation and engraftment will be determined in vivo with orthotopically grafted organoid (OGO) mouse model. This proposed study will identify mutant specific Kras effectors and hopefully lead future studies to novel therapeutic targets for mutant Kras- driven PDAC. Knowledge that comes out of this study may also shed light on other Kras mutant cancers such as lung and colon adenocarcinoma."
"9458671","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients, caregivers, clinicians, insurers, and policymakers all agree that fall injuries represent grievous events for older persons and a major public health problem. Thirty percent of persons over the age of 65 fall each year, and for those over 75 the rates are even higher. Serious fall injuries are a common source of disability and death among the elderly. This randomized trial - a collaboration among investigators, patients, and stakeholders from the 14 U.S. Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Centers (OAICs) and 10 healthcare systems where patients will be recruited - will determine the effectiveness of an evidence-based, multifactorial, patient-centered intervention to reduce the risk of serious fall injuries among non-institutionalized older persons. The investigators, patient and stakeholders worked together via conference calls and focus groups to prepare the application, and will continue to work together within a structured collaborative frame- work to implement the trial, including its interim and final analyses, and the dissemination of its results Our integrated strategy to reduce serious fall injuries, guided by input from our patient advisors and stakeholders during conference calls and focus groups, includes several patient-centered components: (a) screening to identify persons at high risk for falls, (b) defining a person's specific risk factors, (c) implementing an evidence-based multifactorial, individually-tailored intervention aimed at mitigating specific risk factors, based on the patient-centered approach developed at Yale and incorporating elements of the CDC and American Geriatrics Society Guidelines (d) reducing the risk of injury if the person falls (e.g., osteoporosis treatment); (e) changing organizational and provider behavior to initiate care processes, based on ACOVE-2 practice redesign model. The trial will utilize a cluster randomization strategy for participant allocation, randomizing clinical practices to our multifactorial intervention or standard care. We propose to enroll 6,000 eligible participants at up to 10 trial sites that reflect geographic and sociodemographic diversity. Enrollment will take place over an 18-month period, and we will follow the participants for a maximum of 3 years. The primary outcome is serious fall injuries, defined as those leading to medical attention, including non- vertebral fractures, joint dislocation, head injury, lacerations, and other major sequalae (e.g. rhabdomyolysis, internal injuries, hypothermia). Secondary outcomes, identified by patients and stakeholders, include all injurious falls, all falls regardless of injury, and indicators of well-being - fall efficacy, physcal function and disability, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. During Year 1, the investigators, patients and stakeholders will collaboratively refine and pilot a strategy for identifying persons t risk for falling and optimize the study design and intervention. The trial will incorporate an adaptive design and a pre-specified mid-term analysis. In addition, the investigators, patients and stakeholders will together evaluate the post-trial scalability and sustainability of the fall injury prevention strategy."
"9396442","Project Summary  Background:  Pulmonary  hypertension  (PH)  is  a  deadly  disease  of  the  lung  vasculature  with  a  complex  pathophysiology  that  remains  largely  undefined.  My  mentor?s  laboratory  established  the  microRNA-­130/301  family as a mediator of PH development and defined a separate mechanism by which iron-­sulfur (Fe-­S) cluster  deficiency promotes PH. Fe-­S clusters are bioinorganic cofactors essential to mitochondrial and cellular function.  Frataxin (FXN) is a mitochondrial protein crucial to Fe-­S biogenesis. Loss of FXN due to a trinucleotide repeat  mutation causes Friedreich?s ataxia (FRDA), a disease characterized by neurologic dysfunction and hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy.  Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  is  often  accompanied  by  PH,  thought  to  be  the  result  of  left  ventricular stiffening rather than direct dysfunction of the pulmonary vessels. However, I have found that hypoxia,  a  key  trigger  of  PH,  down-­regulated  FXN  expression  in  pulmonary  arterial  endothelial  cells.  FXN  was  also  decreased  in  the  pulmonary  vasculature  of  mice  and  humans  with  PH.  Consequently,  such  FXN  deficiency  altered endothelial mitochondrial, vasomotor, apoptotic indices, thus leading to preliminary data regarding the  alteration of PH in vivo. Taken together, there may be a direct role for FXN in PH. Hypothesis: FXN deficiency,  induced by hypoxia or genetic mutation, disrupts endothelial metabolism and function to promote PH.   Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether hypoxic down-­regulation of FXN is controlled by miR-­130b. I have  found that the FXN transcript contains a possible binding site for the PH-­relevant miR-­130b. By gain-­ and loss-­ of-­function methods in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, I will determine whether hypoxia-­induced miR-­130b  decreases FXN expression, thus defining a causative relationship among miR-­130b, FXN, and Fe-­S biogenesis.   2) Determine whether FXN loss attenuates mitochondrial respiration and endothelial function. In primary  endothelial cells and inducible pluripotent stem cell-­derived endothelial cells (iPSC-­ECs) from FRDA patients, I  will test the hypothesis that FXN deficiency induces Fe-­S cluster-­dependent mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting  in endothelial phenotypic changes (e.g., apoptosis, proliferation). If successful, findings could establish a key link  between hypoxia-­ or genetically-­driven FXN loss and endothelial dysfunction consistent with PH.  3) Establish whether FXN loss and resulting mitochondrial dysfunction predisposes to PH in vivo. In a  tamoxifen-­dependent endothelial cell FXN knockout mouse model, I will test the hypothesis that FXN deficiency  in the pulmonary endothelium promotes molecular, histologic, and hemodynamic changes consistent with PH. If  successful, these results will validate an integral and direct role for FXN in the development of PH.  Significance: This project is ideally structured to train me as a physician-­scientist and bridge the gap between  basic science and clinical medicine. I aim to contribute to the currently deficient understanding of Fe-­S assembly  proteins in endothelial function. I could also identify FXN as a key pathogenic factor in PH, offering the potential  of diagnosing FRDA patients at risk for PH and defining FXN as a new drug target to benefit all PH patients. "
"9308252","The goal of Project 4 is to elucidate the separate and combined effects of nanomaterial-based processes and microbial degradation on transformations of target Superfund chemicals, to better understand how nanomaterial-based remediation technologies might be best applied and, to achieve a maximum reduction in toxicity using combined nano-bio remediation. In addition, we seek to understand the potential impacts of nanomaterials themselves on the microbial ecology in sediments. The target contaminants for this study include an organophosphate insecticide (chlorpyrifos), a representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene), and a polybrominated flame retardant (decabrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-209). The pervasiveness of these compounds has resulted in a significant need for remediation-strategies to ameliorate their toxicity; however, care must be taken to ensure that remediation techniques do not result in increased toxicity or adverse effects from the use of the technology and/or the degradation products. This project studies remediation using zero valent iron (ZVI) and titanium dioxide (Ti02) nanomaterials for contaminant degradation. Our objectives are to: 1) Investigate the use of nanomaterials as catalysts for direct treatment of sediment and water contaminated by developmental toxicants; 2) Assess microbial degradation of the target contaminants by sediment microorganisms with and without nanomaterials; and 3) Uncover possible synergies (or unintended antagonistic effects) of nanoparticle-based remediation with natural microbial degradation processes."
"9548134","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary hypothesis is that rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will lead to improved memory, language and executive function compared to patients who receive a sham, control treatment. The improvement is defined as having higher performance on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). Secondary Hypothesis are that 1)rTMS- will lead to higher performance on secondary cognitive measures relating to executive function and naming compared to performance by participants in the sham treatment group at the termination of treatment; and that 2) rTMS-induced memory improvement parallels changes in BDNF levels after treatment. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is extremely common among older adults, and is the most frequent cause of dementia in the general population (Kukull et al., 2002; National Institute of Health, 2010). Current treatments of AD are limited in their effectiveness and do not halt the progress of the disease. rTMS has been found to be effective in several conditions related to AD, and there is emerging evidence to suggest that it may be effective in treating AD (Bentwich et al., 2011; Ahmed et al., 2012, Rabey et al., 2013, Tezzon et al., 2014). Studies show that rTMS modifies the neuronal networking function (Hamidi et al., 2010; van der Werf et al., 2010). Although the exact mechanism by which rTMS causes improvement in cognitive function is unknown, it has been observed that rTMS reversed a decline in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), lead to up-regulated NMDA-receptor expression in the hippocampus in mice (Tan et al., 2013) ), and caused increased level of BDNF in chronic pain patients (Dall'Agnol et al., 2014). This study aims to obtain better understanding how rTMS affect BDNF levels and how the change in BDNF level corresponds to cognitive improvement. The literature on rTMS and AD includes several studies, but all have significant limitations. First, studies have not involved comprehensive memory assessment (Bentwich et al., 2011; Cotelli et al., 2006, 2008, 2011), despite memory impairment being a primary deficit in AD (McKhann et al., 2011). Second, some studies have not included a control group or controlled for practice effects on cognitive testing. Third, studie have been limited by small sample sizes, limiting the power to detect effects of rTMS on cognitive functioning. Lastly, no studies have been completed with Veteran patients. This study will include 52 Veterans with a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment due to AD or Dementia due to AD over a period of two years. To account for an estimated 20% attrition rate, we will recruit an additional 10 participants to ensure a sufficient sample size and power to complete analyses (final sample n = 62). This double-blinded, randomized clinical trial will consist of two groups: Group 1) rTMS treatment group, two treatments applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 5 days a week for 2 weeks (similar to another ongoing protocol at this site) and Group 2) sham treatment (same frequency and duration). Participants will complete a battery of neuropsychological measures at three time points: initial baseline evaluation, immediately after treatment, and 4 months after cessation of treatment. Adverse effects of rTMS will be recorded carefully. The primary outcome measure will be the California Verbal Learning Test, second edition. Secondary outcome measures will include the Naming subtest of the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery and the NIH EXAMINER (Executive Abilities: Measures and Instruments for Neurobehavioral Evaluation and Research; Kramer et al., 2014). Serum and CSF levels of BDNF and choline acetyltransferase will be collected and analyzed. Apo-e and BDNF genotypes will be determined. Apo-E and BDNF genotypes will be used as moderator of the response. ANOVAs will be used to compare performance on the neuropsychological measures by the treatment and control group at and 4 months after the cessation of treatment."
"9539312","Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH), which is a diminished ability to perceive the onset of hypoglycemia (HG) and typically co-exists with a reduction in the counterregulatory hormone responses (CRR) to HG, triples the risk of experiencing potentially fatal severe hypoglycemia for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Our long- term goal remains to identify how recurrent HG leads to the clinical syndrome of IAH in T1D. Here we will study the cerebral mechanisms of IAH in the setting of T1D following exposure to experimental recurrent HG and test the hypothesis that recurrent HG in T1D leads to an upregulation in brain glucose transport and alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic tone. We will use MRS methodology that permits evaluation of cerebral cortex and hypothalamus in the same session to simultaneously evaluate the cerebral correlates/mediators of impaired awareness and impaired CRR. High MR data quality and reproducibility will be ensured by using high field MR scanners and technical advances we made during the last grant cycle (automated voxel placement, real-time voxel tracking, dynamic frequency and shim updates). Continuous glucose monitoring and actigraphy will be used to chronicle glucose variability and activity/exercise/sleep during the weeks before each experiment to assess the impact of these variables on IAH. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: To measure the neurochemical response to hypoglycemia in T1D (N=50) before and after induction of IAH. Neurochemical profiles including glutamate, GABA and glucose will be measured in the frontal cortex, a region associated with IAH in prior neuroimaging work, and in hypothalamus, which regulates CRR, during euglycemia and HG at 7 tesla, at baseline and after a recurrent HG protocol that robustly induces IAH in patients with T1D and NAH. Aim 2: To measure cerebral glucose transport in T1D (N=50) before and after induction of IAH. Kinetic parameters for glucose transport will be measured in the frontal cortex and hypothalamus using hyperglycemic clamps at 3 tesla at baseline and after recurrent HG. These experiments will establish if recurrent HG alters cerebral glucose availability and glutamate and GABA tone in T1D and if these cerebral adaptations are associated with the development of blunted CRR and diminished symptoms in patients with T1D. In addition, we will learn how glycemic excursions and activity/sleep impact the induction of IAH. These observations are expected to lead to new ways to prevent and treat this life-threatening condition in T1D."
"9465349","Abstract: Over the past few decades, there has been a significant increase in the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who then suffer from more severe disease outcomes. This is becoming a serious issue faced by clinicians in the management of the comorbidity. The current standard treatment for CDI is antibiotics, such as vancomycin, which disrupts gut microbiota and induces high rates of recurrence, up to 35%. Since both IBD and CDI are associated with dysbiosis of gut microbiota, a treatment approach that is not associated with the induction of microbiota dysbiosis is urgently needed to curb the rapidly increasing incidence of CDI comorbidity with IBD.!We propose to develop a non- traditional therapeutic against comorbidity of CDI in patients with IBD that does not promote bacterial resistance, a major concern to public health worldwide. Our goal is to develop a novel combinational immunotherapy by utilizing probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii to deliver therapeutic antibodies against major C. difficile toxins and inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?). We have already generated a lead S. boulardii strain (FZ002) stably secreting a tetra-specific toxin-neutralizing antibody called ABAB. This antibody simultaneously targets the two major virulence factors toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) at the site of C. difficile infection and exhibits significant protection against CDI. In this project, we will construct another S. boulardii strain to stably secrete an anti-TNF-? neutralizing antibody (Sb-aTNF). We will then evaluate therapeutic efficacy of oral FZ002 combined with Sb-aTNF for treating CDI comorbidity with IBD in mouse disease models. With this proof-of-concept study, we expect to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel immunotherapeutic modality based on probiotic yeast for oral delivery of therapeutic antibodies to intestines where the comorbidity of CDI and IBD occurs. This will justify a larger development effort in a Phase II study to generate a final lead of combinational yeast immunotherapy to treat the comorbidity of CDI and IBD."
"9446720","There are approximately 100,000 patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States and 240,000 children born with SCD each year in Africa. Despite regular transcranial Doppler screening, 38% have silent, white matter strokes detectable by MRI before their 14th birthday leading to significant cognitive dysfunction. Similar brain lesions are seen in patients with thalassemia intermedia, obstructive sleep apnea, severe acute anemia, and the elderly, suggesting a general, non-sickle-related, mechanism. We postulate that anemia itself, by diminishing cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), predisposes the brain to injury in key vulnerable areas. Our arguments are based on our following preliminary data: 1) Anemic patients increase their resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) such that oxygen delivery is normal, independent of the anemia mechanism. 2) CVR declines inversely with resting CBF, approaching 0% in some SCD patients 3) we observe white matter loss and abnormal diffusivity in both SCD patients and non sickle cell anemia patients. 4) The pattern of volume loss and abnormal diffusivity predicts regions of low CVR from a completely different patient cohort. We propose to study the relationship between CVR, anemia, and white matter loss in chronic anemia patients at particularly high risk for silent stroke (sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and other rare anemias). Specifically, we will determine if focal areas of decreased CVR occur in the same distribution as silent strokes and preclinical white matter injury, and whether transfusion improves CVR these vulnerable regions.  Increase in regional flow measured by arterial spin labeling MRI in response to acetazolamide is a measure of CVR. Thus the goal of this project is validate CVR as a biomarker for white matter vulnerability that can be used as a means of discovery for future clinical trials of silent stroke prophylaxis. To validate CVR, we will first identify its relationship with hemoglobin level and known vascular biomarkers to identify potentially modifiable risk factors. We will determine whether low CVR predicts decreased white matter volume, loss of axonal integrity, silent stroke, and impaired neurocognitive function in chronically anemic subjects as compared to controls. Lastly, we will test whether raising hemoglobin (simple transfusion), lowering hemoglobin S (isocrit exchange transfusion) or hydroxyurea improve CVR in the white matter regions at risk for stroke.  Although targeted toward high-risk groups (hemoglobinopathies), this research has profound implications regarding white matter disease found in the general population, including the elderly, patients with sleep apnea, diabetes, and hypertension. White matter strokes occur in more than 30% of individuals older than 65 and are associated with neurocognitive dysfunction, depression, falling, and all-cause mortality. Anemia is common in the elderly (9.6% of patients in assisted living) and increases white matter stroke risk by 1.8 fold. Thus the techniques and knowledge gained from this study will translate broadly."
"9466520","PROJECT SUMMARY Glycans have several distinct properties that make them potential disease biomarkers. Firstly, their location on cell surfaces makes them the first point of contact for cellular interactions, and thus they are crucial in the control of normal metabolic processes. Secondly, cell surface molecules are strategically exposed for surveillance by the immune system, where they may serve as immune recognition elements. Thirdly, specific glycan structures that are not present, or are in low amounts in normal states, proliferate in disease states, such as cancer. For example, variation in glycan sialylation is a marker for diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and prostate cancer, however, to fully exploit sialic acid as a disease marker requires the ability to detect it in each of its linkage contexts. At present multiple lectins are employed in serial lectin affinity chromatography to enrich sialylated glycans for glycomic analysis, which because of specificity issues associated with the lectins risks capturing irrelevant non-sialylated components. To overcome the limitations of existing lectins, we have used structurally-guided mutagenesis, to convert the carbohydrate-processing enzyme NanB (from S. pneumoniae) into a high-affinity reagent (Sia-3S1) specific for detecting 3'-sialylated glycans. Sia-3S1 shows significant advantages over existing reagents in chromatographic applications that are commonly used in disease marker detection. Such engineered proteins are referred to as ?Lectenz®? because they have lectin-like properties, but retain the specificity of the endogenous enzymes. Lectenz® have several advantages over either lectins or antibodies, including precise definition of specificity, tuneable affinity, and ease of production. Few reagents exist that can be used to enrich a sample for unique glycan modifications. Specific Lectenz® such as Sia-3S1 directly address the needs of glyco-biomarker detection and mass spectrometry-based glycomics/proteomics analysis by enabling or improving sample enrichment. It could also be employed in histological studies, or Western blots, etc. In this application we illustrate that the development of Sia-3S1 has passed the proto-type stage, and demonstrate the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of advancing this technology into a highly desirable reagent and commercializable suite of tools."
"9406331","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Childhood overweight is an important public-health problem in the US. Current estimates indicate that one in three children is overweight. Over half of overweight 5-10 year-old children have at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor, and overweight increases the lifetime risk of cardiovascular morbidity and premature death, but these risks are reduced in overweight children who attain a normal weight. During well-child visits, pediatricians have an opportunity to address weight and weight-management. Little is known, however, about clinical practice elements and pediatrician-patient communication strategies associated with weight improvement in overweight children. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify specific clinical practice elements and pediatrician-patient communication strategies during well-child visits that predict improvement in relative weight among overweight children. This will be accomplished through three specific aims, which are to 1) identify specific clinical practice elements in pediatric primary care that predict improvement in weight status; 2) determine communication strategies that predict improvement in weight status; and 3) develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a pilot intervention to improv pediatricians' communication and use of specific clinical practice elements when addressing weight and weight management during primary-care visits with overweight children. For Aim 1, electronic medical records (EMR) will be analyzed to determine clinical practice elements (such as lab assessments and follow-up interval) associated with improvement in weight status at one year follow-up. For Aim 2, Roter Interaction Analysis of video- recorded well-child visits will be used to analyze pediatrician-patient communication regarding weight and weight-management (including assessment and counseling regarding overweight status, and communication dynamics, including patient-centeredness), and children will be followed, by tracking interval visits, weights/heights, and referrals using the EMR, over one year. Findings from Aims 1 and 2 will be used in Aim 3 to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a pilot intervention aimed at improving pediatricians' observed and self-reported competence in using specific clinical practice elements and effective communication when addressing overweight during primary-care visits, compared with a control group of standard practice. The proposed Career Development Award addresses how to improve overweight/obesity management in primary care, a research priority of an NHLBI Working Group convened to set future research priorities in childhood obesity prevention and treatment. The exceptional resources and institutional support at UT Southwestern, outstanding multi-disciplinary mentorship team, and proposed career development activities will allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and nationally recognized expert on primary-care based interventions that are effective in improving childhood overweight and obesity."
"9466642","Over 1 Million diagnostic X-ray angiograms are performed annually in the US to guide treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cost over $12 billion. Despite being the clinical standard of care, visual interpretation is prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently as part of the NHLBI supported Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial, our research team showed that cardiologists misinterpreted over 19% of angiograms obstructive CAD (greater than 50% vessel stenosis). Given the centrality of angiographic interpretation to the development of a treatment plan, reduced accuracy can lead to unnecessary poor outcomes and increased costs to our healthcare system. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) offers a computed measure of disease severity. However, the time and training required to perform QCA has largely relegated its use to research applications. Recent advances in deep learning for medical image analysis offer an opportunity to address this problem. The potential impact is significant given increasing interpretation accuracy by 1% can positively benefit over 10,000 patients each year. Thus, our team proposes to develop an X-ray angiographic analysis system (XAngio) driven by deep learning technology to enhance physician interpretation. We are uniquely positioned to accelerate development of XAngio by leveraging our team?s PROMISE dataset of over 1,000 angiograms with expert QCA scoring. In Phase I, we will teach XAngio how to read angiographic images and how to discriminate obstructive CAD. XAngio will employ a convolutional neural network, a computer vision technique rooted in deep learning, to self-characterize angiographic features from labeled images. In order to infer additional information from vast amounts of unlabeled images, XAngio will incorporate a deconvolutional neural network technique to increase predictive performance. A pilot study of XAngio will test its ability to identify the presence of obstructive CAD in PROMISE angiogram images. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal which is focused on clinical translation of the technology and assessment of its impact on improving visual interpretation in a cohort of cardiologists. Our goal is to combine recent advances in deep learning, big data from PROMISE, and scalable parallel computing to create XAngio. In the long term, we hope the combination of a cardiologist with XAngio as an assistive tool will improve the clinical accuracy of angiographic interpretation."
"9416751","PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Chicago Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is designed to provide research training and enrichment activities to recent college graduates from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral sciences so they will be better prepared to apply, matriculate, and succeed in a PhD program. It is based on the concept that an in-depth mentored research experience, along with enrichment activities that help develop identity as a scientist, is the optimal preparation for graduate studies in the biomedical sciences. The background and research interests of each participant are considered when selecting Mentors for one year of laboratory-based research, with Mentors who have outstanding records of promoting the training, education, and career advancement of biomedical scientists. The research experience is complemented by a multi-tiered skill-enhancement program for improving oral and written communication, critical thinking and analysis, and ethical decision-making. Training in such skills is provided by a year-long PREP Journal Club, numerous workshops, a writing course, an ethics course, academic courses, and other skill-building activities. Although the Program is highly structured and logically organized, it is flexible in that an Individual Development Plan (IDP) serves as the roadmap for each Scholar's course over their tenure in the University of Chicago PREP. The Program and its components are assessed at specific intervals throughout the year, including both internal and external evaluations. The ultimate success will be measured by the matriculation of Scholars into PhD programs, their completion of PhD programs, and their long-term successes as biomedical scientists."
"9615353","ABSTRACT  The activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is a major regulatory checkpoint for the generation of adaptive immunity. Rig-I-like Receptors (RLRs) are a family of PRRs that recognize microbial RNA in the cytosol and induce proinflammatory cytokines and type I and type III interferons. RLRs are important mediators of innate immunity to multiple viral infections. However, the role of RLRs in the regulation of adaptive immunity is still poorly understood. The adaptive immune response to West Nile Virus (WNV) infection is severely dysregulated in the absence of MAVS (also called IPS-1), the essential signaling adaptor of RLRs. In this proposal, we will elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the RLR-dependent regulation of B cell responses to WNV. This study will provide fundamental conceptual insights that are necessary for the design of novel vaccines to WNV in particular and RNA viruses in general."
"9441584","PROJECT SUMMARY Immunological memory is the ability of our immune system to respond with greater strength and quickness upon re-encounter with the same pathogen (i.e. secondary infection). Immunological memory is the basis for vaccination which remains the most successful method for preventing infectious disease. Yet, a fully protective vaccine to prevent any human parasitic disease has not been realized to date. Why is sterilizing immunity to parasitic pathogens so difficulty to achieve? Our previous work on secondary infections with the apicomplexan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, suggests that parasitic virulence factors are the key to evading adaptive immune responses. Whereas antigenic variation is a major mechanism by which protozoan pathogens such as African Trypanosomes, Plasmodium and Giardia evade B cell-mediated antibody responses, little is known regarding virulence factors that manipulate T cell responses. Given the central role of CD8 T cell-mediated immunity to a wide variety of protozoan pathogens, including T. gondii, this proposal aims to discover parasitic virulence factors that manipulate CD8 T cell responses. Here we report that T. gondii secreted effectors, ROP5 and a second determinant we name ?ROCTR? (Regulator Of CD8 T Cell Responses), work to inhibit T. gondii-specific CD8 T cell responses to parasite-infected cells. ROP5 is a multigene variable family of pseudokinases that are injected into the host cell it invades. Following invasion, T. gondii forms a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that it replicates within. ROP5 localizes to the cytosolic side of the PV membrane (PVM) protecting it from destruction by the host?s IFN?-induced Immunity Related GTPases (IRGs). Proteins that enter the MHC1 antigen presentation pathway are mainly derived from cytosolic proteins that are degraded by the host?s proteasome. Apicomplexan parasites sequester themselves in a non-fusogenic PV, mostly devoid of host proteins. How does the immune system gain access to vacuolar antigens that are not within conventional endocytic compartments of the cell? Our central hypothesis is that T. gondii ROP5 and an IRG intersect the MHC1 antigen presentation pathway, and that T. gondii ROCTR may regulate this process. However, the identities T. gondii ROCTR and the host IRGs that regulate CD8 T cell activation are unknown. This proposal aims to identify these factors. By analyzing CD8 T cells from T57 mice, which possess a single T cell receptor specificity for the T. gondii TGD05796-103 / Kb antigen complex, T57 T cells were found to secrete IFN? in response to T. gondii-infected macrophages in a strain dependent manner. Using the latest approaches in genome engineering and parasite genetics, we will elucidate mechanisms of immune evasion by T. gondii and determine host requirements for MHC1 antigen presentation of vacuolated pathogens. Through careful dissection, a ?chink in the armor? of T. gondii may be revealed, and give insight into vaccine design for apicomplexan pathogens."
"9448886","Project Summary Our long-term goal is to develop drugs that target the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR2) for heart failure (HF) and arrhythmia therapy. RyR2 Ca release is a key player in regulating cardiac contraction, electrophysiology, energetics and signaling. Abnormally high diastolic SR Ca ?leak? via RyR2, and reduced SR Ca uptake, conspire to reduce SR Ca content and elevate diastolic [Ca]i, hallmarks of both systolic and diastolic HF. Inappropriately timed SR Ca leak is also arrhythmogenic. Thus RyR2 is widely recognized as a molecular target with excellent therapeutic potential for HF and some arrhythmias. Indeed, some repurposed drugs provide proof-of-principle for this concept. To greatly accelerate discovery of drugs that target the RyR2 leak, we propose the first high-throughput screening (HTS) methods using our well-established FRET-based RyR-targeting system and extensive supporting basic research.  Pathology-associated RyR leak is associated with two phenotypic features that are sensitive to RyR conformation ? reduced calmodulin (CaM) binding and increased binding of a biosensor peptide (DPc10). We find that SR Ca leak can be reversed by either forced CaM binding or dantrolene (a drug used for acute RyR1 leak in malignant hyperthermia). Dantrolene is unsuitable for chronic use, so we seek novel drugs that restore normal CaM and DPc10 affinity (RyR conformation) and thus inhibit pathological SR Ca leak.  We have established direct FRET-based assays of CaM and DPc10 binding to RyR2, and a novel fluorescence lifetime plate-reader enables the translation of these FRET tools into ultrasensitive assays of RyR conformation and interactions with binding partners, in HTS format. Results from pilot screens demonstrate that we are poised to carry out an explicit drug-discovery campaign to detect pathophysiological RyR2 conformations and identify compounds that restore normal RyR2 conformation and function, thus translating our mechanistic research into therapies. Identification of lead compounds from this HTS platform and medicinal chemistry development of analogues will be focused through secondary screens that measure RyR activity in SR membranes, and cellular toxicity and Ca leak in patient-derived iPSC cardiomyocytes and in animal- derived adult ventricular myocytes (normal and HF). Feasibility is ensured by: (1) a robust and sensitive FRET system to specifically resolve RyR structural changes, (2) demonstrated experience applying this FRET system for RyR1-targeted HTS, (3) a novel high-precision FLT-PR, (4) functional insight from parallel hypothesis- driven mechanistic myocyte and animal studies, and (5) top-notch team of MPIs and collaborators. The central hypothesis ? that binding of CaM and DPc10 to RyR2 are key markers of RyR2 pathology ? will be tested in the following Specific Aims: (1) Screen a collection of 50k-350k compounds, and (2) Determine Hit effects on RyR2-mediated calcium leak in control and HF myocytes. Outcomes will include new HTS assays, a model for large-scale HTS campaigns, and novel compounds that may be developed into new drugs or RyR2 probes."
"9405021","The BioCAT Biotechnology Research Resource operates X-ray beamline 18ID at the Advanced Photon  Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Now in its 20th year of operation, it is a mature, productive facility with  many capabilities unique in the USA, and, arguably, the world. Going forward, we intend to maintain our world-  class capabilities in static, time- and spatially-resolved fiber diffraction with beamline enhancements for  increased flux and beam quality. A novel high speed, high sensitivity, high spatial resolution pixel array  detector will provide an excellent match to the needs of our muscle diffraction program. Also proposed is a  versatile micro-diffraction/micro-SAXS instrument that can use one of two Compound Refractive Lenses  optimized for either wide- or small-angle fiber crystallography, and continuous flow SAXS experiments. We will  implement multimodal scanning micro-diffraction, x-ray florescence microscopy, phase contrast and uv/visible  imaging that can be done either singly or in combination with the same instrument on the same samples.  Developments in time-resolved SAXS will extend available time regimes from 500 ns to seconds with major  reductions in sample consumption, by more than order of magnitude, from current capabilities. This will allow  a much wider range of biomedical problems to be addressed than previously possible. A new beamline data  acquisition and control system will provide a common interface and better data management for all  experiments and advanced support for time resolved experiments. Combined refractive index, dynamic light  scattering and multi-angle light scattering measurements with SAXS will offer more comprehensive sample  characterization on-line for more robust results. A multi-scale modeling effort will allow extracting more  information from muscle X-ray diffraction studies. The proposed developments in multi-scale simulations for  interpreting single molecule SAXS data will profoundly benefit studies of multicomponent systems that show  considerable conformational heterogeneity. Our relationship with the CCP-SAS project will enable us to widely  disseminate the advanced modeling tools we create to not only all our DBP's, collaborative and service users  but to the wider biomedical community. Our Driving Biomedical Projects, collaborative, and service projects  have relevance to basic mechanisms of muscle function, heart disease, retinitis pigmentosa, cancer and  neuro-degenerative diseases. Our proposed training activities are designed to ensure safe, efficient and  productive use of the resource by our users.

"9453491","Project Abstract  Self-assembled multifunctional aptamer-complex biomaterial for precision medicine Oligonucleotide aptamers are a class of biomaterials that function as molecular ligands with high affinity and specificity for a wide range of biological targets. Similarly to protein antibodies, aptamers bind to their cognate targets via conformational recognition and thus, are often referred to as ?chemical antibodies?. As small-sized oligonucleotide biomaterials, aptamers can be rapidly synthesized and easily conjugated to various functional agents for different clinical needs, and exhibit faster cancer-cell binding ability and deeper tumor-tissue penetration than antibodies. The aforementioned features provide aptamers with notable advantages over protein antibodies for clinical applications, and render them unique biomaterials for clinical use. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is the most common T-cell lymphoma in children. Biologically, lymphoma cells express high-levels of the surface CD30 receptor, a signaling molecule regulating cell fate and a distinct biomarker for ALCL diagnosis. Genetically, lymphoma cells express the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) oncogene. Currently, CHOP chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for ALK+ ALCL although is not ALCL cell-selective or ALK gene-specific, and has serious adverse side effects. To address these clinical challenges, we will develop a multifunctional aptamer-complex biomaterial through self-assembly of functional oligonucleotides (aptamer and siRNA sequences) and self-loading of therapeutic drugs. The formed aptamer-complex will act via three therapeutic modalities for simultaneous ALK+ ALCL cell- targeted chemotherapy, gene therapy, and immunotherapy. We hypothesize that under CD30 aptamer guidance, the aptamer-complex will specifically target ALCL cells and treat lymphoma through combination of different cellular mechanisms, acting as (i) a chemotherapeutic killing lymphoma cells via cell-targeted drug delivery, (ii) a gene therapeutic silencing ALK oncogene via aptamer-facilitated intracellular delivery of siRNA, and (iii) an immunotherapeutic triggering apoptotic cell death via aptamer-mediated activation of cell CD30 signaling. To validate our hypothesis, the following studies will be conducted: To validate our hypothesis, the following studies will be conducted: Aim 1: Formulation of self-assembled aptamer-complex biomaterial. Aim 2: Functional validation of aptamer-complex. Aim 3: Preclinical study of aptamer-complex for precision therapy of lymphoma. Aim 4: Preclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies of aptamer-complex. Technically, this study capitalizes on aptamer technology to develop a unique multifunctional biomaterial for precision medicine. Scientifically, this study will provide a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat ALCL by stimulating cellular naïve apoptotic signaling via aptamer-mediated activation of CD30 receptors. Clinically, the aptamer-complex will enhance therapeutic efficacy, reduce development of drug resistance in lymphoma cells, and avoid off-target toxicity to normal cells/tissues, by combining three different targeted therapeutic mechanisms."

Further, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are becoming more common, as MRSA are more difficult to treat and are more virulent than methicillin sensitive strains. The Aims of this proposal will focus on the role of IL1ß in S. aureus and S. pneumoniae keratitis because our preliminary data show that this cytokine has a critical role in regulating corneal infection by either bacteria. IL-1ß secretion requires tw signals - Signal 1 for transcription, and Signal 2 for enzymatic processing; therefore, Aim 1 will examine the role of bacterial cell wall in inducing NOD2/RIP2 signaling in IL-1ß-/- transcription, and Aim 2 will examine the role of Staph aureus ?-hemolysin and Strep pneumoniae pneumolysin induction of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome in caspase-1 mediated IL-1ß cleavage. Aim 3 will examine the role of ATP and purinergic receptors in amplifying inflammasome activity and IL-1ß production. Results of these studies will identify novel pathways that can be targeted for anti-inflammatory therapies."

"9434345","PROJECT SUMMARY Factor XIa (fXIa), the protease form of the plasma protein factor XI (fXI), contributes to thrombin generation primarily by catalyzing activation of factor IX (fIX). This appears to reflect an ancillary role in the host hemostatic response to injury, as fXI deficiency causes, at most, a relatively mild bleeding disorder. Despite its limited role in hemostasis, mounting evidence from human population studies and animal models support the premise that fXI contributes substantively to venous and arterial thrombosis. This has lead to considerable interest in therapeutic inhibition of fXIa, with the hope that such a strategy will produce a useful antithrombotic effect, with a smaller impact on hemostasis than currently used anticoagulants such as heparin, warfarin and newer direct oral anticoagulants. FXI is structurally distinct from the vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteases that form the core of the thrombin generation mechanism. Indeed, fXI arose from a duplication of the gene for prekallikrein (PK), the precursor of the protease ?-kallikrein. PK, along with factor XII (fXII) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK) form the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), a component of the innate immune response that generates proinflammatory peptides in response to injury. As a homolog of PK, fXI retains activities of the parent molecule. However, fXI has acquired unique features that facilitate its interactions with the thrombin generation mechanism. Our current working model is that fXI functions as a bi-directional interface between thrombin generation and the KKS, and that this places it in a position to influence the effects of both systems on thrombotic and inflammatory processes. Work in our laboratory is directed at establishing a better understanding of the biochemistry, molecular biology and pathophysiology of fXI, and its relationships with thrombin generation and the KKS. We take a broad approach to this problem, which is reflected in the three Focus Areas described in this application. Focus Area 1 investigates important structure-function relationships in the fXI molecule that are relevant to its activity in flowing blood. Focus Area 2 will investigate the contributions of fXI, fXII, PK and HK to thrombus formation and sepsis in mouse models. We will also investigate the role of fXI in modulating bleeding tendency in mice lacking factor IX (a model of hemophilia B), and pursue a recent observation that the majority of fXI in the vasculature forms a non-circulating pool associated with the blood vessel wall. Finally, work in Focus Area 3 is directed at a better understanding of fXII, the precursor of a protease (fXIIa), that activates fXI and PK, and that contributes to thrombo-inflammatory processes. We strongly feel that the expertise in our laboratory at Vanderbilt University, and the stellar group of collaborators in academia and industry that have worked with us for over a decade, place us in a unique position to make important contributions to the field of thrombosis research, with the goal of better informing efforts to develop novel antithrombotic therapies."
"9406125","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Optogenetics holds tremendous potential for restoring vision to individuals with late-stage retinal degeneration, particularly those patients who have lost most of their photoreceptors.  One promising therapeutic strategy is to express a light-sensitive protein in non-photosensitive bipolar cells by gene therapy.  Current approaches are limited by inefficient bipolar targeting and expression, and require application of potentially phototoxic levels of blue-green light to stimulate the optogenetic actuator.  The objective of the present proposal is to overcome these challenges by utilizing directed evolution and synthetic biology to engineer an AAV-based delivery system to target red-shifted optogenetic devices to both ON and OFF bipolar cells, and to employ this system to treat blindness in mice.  In Aim 1, we will use directed evolution to engineer new AAV serotypes capable of highly efficient bipolar AAV infection after injection into the vitreous humor.  In Aim 2, we will utilize a novel technolog called CRE-seq to engineer thousands of compact, ON bipolar-specific promoters that exhibit excellent specificity and a wide range of expression strengths.  In addition, we will engineer an AAV-deliverable synthetic gene circuit to target an optogenetic inhibitor specifically to OFF bipolar cells.  In Aim 3, we will combine the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 with the use of red-shifted optogenetic devices to restore functional vision to rd1 mutant mice.  We recently discovered the enzyme responsible for the 'rhodopsin- porphyropsin' switch in vertebrates, and we will use this enzyme to red-shift optogenetic devices, making them sensitive to far red light (> 650 nm).  This therapeutic approach has the potential to dramatically improve light- sensitivity in the rescued mice and will avoid the retinal damage associated with high-intensity blue light exposure, thereby permitting unprecedented levels of functional restoration and setting the stage for future trials in human patients."
"9624870","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ?15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice."
"9544231","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a complication of diabetes and the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults, is a retinal disease whose prolonged course typically begins years prior to diagnosis. DR is presently diagnosed by clinical findings on examination; by the time these are visible, significant irreversible damage to the retina has already occurred for most patients. Insufficient oxygen delivery and hypoxia associated with the energy-demanding photoreceptors has been implicated in the early stage of the disease. Such oxygen delivery-utilization mismatch ultimately precipitates late stage neovascularization and vision loss. We hypothesize that the mismatch in oxygen delivery-utilization in the retina results in abnormal blood flow and tissue oxygenation in the early stage of DR before vision loss. Currently, there are no existing non- invasive imaging technologies available to detect these early changes, when intervention could be most effective. Imaging technologies that can detect early changes in blood flow and oxygenation could accelerate early detection of DR, offer focused screening of population at risk, and enable longitudinal treatment monitoring. Early detection has the potential to prevent blindness and improve treatment outcomes, including quality of life.  Most existing retinal imaging techniques lack depth-resolved information (except optical coherence tomography for anatomical imaging) and rely on optical transparency which is frequently hampered by media opacity (e.g., cataracts and vitreous hemorrhages). In contrast, MRI can provide anatomical, physiological, and functional data with lamina-specific depth resolution. Its application to the thin retina, however, has been challenging. Our group pioneered multi-parametric, layer-specific retinal MRI in animals and has demonstrated some unique advantages. This proposal aims to take the first step to translate this innovative approach to study the human retina. Our central hypothesis is that: i) high-resolution MRI can provide anatomical, physiological, and functional images of the human retina with laminar resolution, and ii) functional and physiological changes in DR patients will occur before structural abnormalities can be detected."
"9466481","PROJECT SUMMARY The Farzan laboratory has developed what appears to be an effective way to prevent HIV-1 infection. This approach combines eCD4-Ig, an exceptionally broad and potent HIV-1 entry inhibitor, with an adeno- associated virus (AAV) delivery system. For more than a year after a one-time intramuscular inoculation with AAV/eCD4-Ig, rhesus macaques were protected against multiple high-dose intravenous challenges with SHIV-AD8 and SIVmac239. AAV vectors have the potential to persist in muscle for a lifetime. This longevity is an important advantage of the AAV system, but also poses risks. Specifically, while it is likely that eCD4-Ig is safe, it has not yet been expressed in large numbers of people or for long periods of time, and there is no easy way to undo AAV administration in case of adverse events. To that end, we seek here to develop a practical means of halting the expression of an AAV transgene. We propose optimizing AAV vectors to be efficiently inactivated upon the administration of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing a modified mRNA that encodes the CRISPR effector protein Cpf1. The optimized system for shutting off AAV transgene expression will then be tested in mice. This work will allow us to include an off-switch in AAV vectors when they are tested in humans. A practical means for turning off eCD4-Ig expression by AAV will improve the safety of an effective approach for treating or preventing HIV-1 infection."

"9530035","RESEARCH & RELATED OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION Project Summary/Abstract Programmed cell death is a critical component of the host antiviral response to infection, serving to limit viral replication, dissemination and spread. Recent attention has revealed programmed necrosis, or necroptosis, as a highly efficient, and important arm of this host response. Necroptosis is controlled by the receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), which receives activating signals arising from ligation of death receptors or pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to drive rapid cell destruction and limit virus replication. As obligate intracellular pathogens that establish life-long infections, herpesviruses control the fate of the cells they infect, encoding a variety of mechanisms to inhibit the host cell death machinery and promote successful infection. The viral inhibitor of RIP activation (vIRA), encoded by the M45 gene product of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), directly inhibits the activation of RIPK3. In the absence of vIRA function, a PRR known as DNA-dependent activator of interferon regulatory factors (DAI/ZBP1) responds to infection and activates RIPK3 to drive necroptosis. While initially described as a cytosolic DNA sensor, accumulating evidence suggests a number of other diverse viruses, including other herpesviruses, influenza and poxviruses, also activate DAI. However, the mechanisms by which they do so remain unclear. Our preliminary studies have revealed MCMV-induced necroptosis requires viral gene expression mediated by the major immediate early (IE) transactivator, IE3, and that DAI binds nascent RNA in infected cells. These data lead to our overall hypothesis that MCMV IE3- dependent transcripts serve as a ligand recognized by DAI to drive antiviral necroptosis, which is inhibited by vIRA during natural infection. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims. First, we propose to combine genetic, biochemical and genomics approaches with a set of unique recombinant viruses to define the role of IE3 in necroptosis and identify the ligand(s) it generates to elicit this pathway. Second, we will interrogate and dissect the mechanism by which DAI recognizes MCMV infection and activates RIPK3. The studies proposed here are intended to fill a critical gap in our knowledge of how viruses like MCMV trigger host antiviral necroptosis, and are anticipated to provide insight into how other viruses with significant human health consequences interact with this pathway."
"9498161","Project Summary After years of assuming that neurological diseases are caused by direct damage to neurons, we now know that impaired astrocyte physiology and function precedes and is essential for the progression of many of these diseases. This revelation hints toward the reason why anti-epileptic drugs that exclusively target neurons do not prevent the development of epilepsy after traumatic brain injury (TBI), the largest group of acquired epilepsies. For more than a decade, data have accumulated showing that astrocytes become reactive and lose their homeostatic functions indispensable for normal neuronal operation in epilepsy patients and animal models. Yet, a direct causal link between astrocyte dysfunction and post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) has not been established beyond the fact TBI triggers astrogliosis. This may be in part due to the complexity of TBI, which induces many pathobiological mechanisms in parallel. Astrogliosis has mostly been studied in focal TBI, where layers of different types of reactive astrocytes surround a site of primary brain damage. Yet, this injury type presents in isolation in less than 10% of TBI patients and induces additional mechanisms that could trigger seizures, limiting our ability to determine if a causal relationship between astrocyte dysfunction and the development of PTE exists. Current PTE models are induced by focal TBI, but the vast majority of human TBIs include diffuse or concussive injury induced by rapid acceleration/deceleration of the brain tissue. Even patients who incur a single mild diffuse TBI are at increased risk for the development of PTE. Therefore, a new PTE mouse model that recapitulated diffuse TBI without focal injury was developed. This new PTE model induced spontaneous seizures at higher incidence than previous PTE models but with only a subset of cellular and tissue level changes, markedly reducing complexity of the underlying pathobiology. Data obtained in this model point to a surprisingly different response of astrocytes to diffuse TBI, suggesting that early loss of astrocytes may contribute to the development PTE. Yet, the upstream molecular mechanism inducing astrocyte loss and the downstream physiological consequences on neurons and neighboring astrocytes must be identified to ultimately find targets for interrupting the progression of TBI to PTE. This proposal aims to determine the primary cause for astrocyte loss using modified Folch extraction and fractionation techniques to narrow down the list of candidates. It further tests the hypothesis that astrocyte loss causes neurons and close-by astrocytes to become dysfunctional, initiating the formation of a seizure focus. This hypothesis will be tested using a combination of imaging, electrophysiology and EEG recordings in PTE mice or after specific ablation of cellular players. Given that the incidence of TBI has increased over the last decade, PTE as a lifelong complication of TBI is not only debilitating for those afflicted, but represents an ever-rising social and economic burden in the US. This proposal will examine astrocyte loss as a root cause initiating epileptogenesis after TBI, and will provide a basis for developing interventions that prevent the progression of TBI toward PTE."

"9470005","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Respiratory disease represents a major health burden around the globe, causing disease in hundreds of millions of people and resulting in four million premature deaths annually. Inorganic arsenic, an established toxicant and carcinogen, has been associated with numerous health outcomes, including cancer of the lung. Evidence on the impact of arsenic exposure on lung function and exacerbation of respiratory symptoms, however, is less conclusive; the limited evidence available suggests exposure is associated with increased respiratory symptoms and decreased lung function. Prospective studies and studies examining low-moderate levels (<50 µg/L) of water arsenic exposure, the level relevant for US populations, are very limited. In addition, no intervention studies have investigated the impact of removing arsenic exposure on respiratory health. We aim to fill in these important gaps in research using existing data from the Strong Heart Study (SHS), a prospective cohort of American Indian men and women that has been ongoing since 1988, and from the Strong Heart Water Study (SHWS), an ongoing multi-level participatory intervention in adults and children to reduce arsenic exposure in drinking water from private wells in American Indian communities in North/South Dakota. First, in the SHS, we will evaluate: baseline arsenic (Visit 1) exposure, measured in urine, with lung function (Visit 2) as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1/FVC (N=3,253); changes in arsenic exposure from Visit 1 to Visit 2 with Visit 2 FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC (n=380); and baseline arsenic exposure with Visit 3 respiratory symptoms in participants with asthma (n=435). Second, at the SHWS at baseline, we will evaluate: the association of arsenic exposure, measured in urine and water, with lung function as measured by FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory flow (FEF 25-75%); respiratory symptoms wheeze, shortness of breath, cough, and phlegm, as measured by questionnaire; and airway inflammation, as measured by fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), in 400 participants including adults and adolescents. Third, in the SHWS follow up, we will evaluate the effect of the arsenic removal filter on changes in respiratory outcomes after installation, assessing change in arsenic level between baseline and six months and the following outcomes between baseline and six months: lung function, respiratory symptoms, and FeNO. Improved understanding of the relation of chronic ingestion of low-moderate arsenic in water and respiratory health and how a prevention intervention can be used to assess the benefits of removing environmental exposures is essential to mitigate the impact of arsenic exposure in a disproportionately exposed population in the United States."
"9468889","Project Summary Modern advancements in military trauma care have resulted in an unprecedented era of combat injured survivors. Over 50,000 service members have been wounded in action in the past 15 years and, for the first time in history, many are able to live with serious injuries that were previously considered fatal. Yet, little is understood about the short- and long-term physical and mental health symptom trajectories of these injuries. Understanding the clinical presentations and symptom trajectories in this severely injured cohort is paramount for nursing science to develop and test interventions and maximize recovery across military, veteran, and traumatically injured civilian populations. This proposed research-intensive training application prepares the applicant to conduct a secondary analysis of data from the recently completed prospective and not yet published longitudinal Regional Anesthesia Military Battlefield Pain Outcomes Study (RAMBPOS) (VA RRD D45064-1). The purpose of RAMBPOS was to examine the short- and long-term benefits of implementing early regional anesthesia techniques for pain control after a major traumatic injury to one or more extremities during combat in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. This is the largest and most comprehensive dataset of combat injured patient reported outcomes and includes longitudinal data on over 300 service members? short- and long-term pain and mental health outcomes. This secondary analysis will address the key question: in an era of unprecedented survival after complex and life-threatening injuries, what are the short- and long-term symptom trajectories of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) based on initial pain severity presentations, even after exposure to pain management interventions, specifically regional anesthesia (RA)? Furthermore, this investigation will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RA, a potential Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) led intervention. The proposed study will further trauma providers? understanding of the complex relationship between pain severity, commonly referred to as the 5th vital sign of nursing care, and PTSD symptom severity in the context of the combat injury phenomena. The findings of this study are relevant not only to military and veteran trauma care, but also to civilians experiencing complex and multisystem injuries. The results of this study will address the National Institute of Nursing Research?s mission of advancing symptom and pain science. This line of inquiry provides foundational training for the applicant to develop a research career committed to improving the quality of life of all seriously injured persons."
"9412503","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal describes a comprehensive five-year training program designed to foster the development of Dr. Bryan D. Kraft, M.D. (Principal Investigator) into an independent physician-scientist. Dr. Kraft completed his residency in Internal Medicine and fellowship in Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at Duke University Medical Center where he is now a Medical Instructor. Dr. Kraft?s long term goal is to develop novel therapeutic approaches to the resolution of acute lung injury (ALI) in critically-ill patients. Dr. Kraft?s research focus is mechanisms of lung repair following bacterial pneumonia, a leading cause of death worldwide despite the use of antibiotics. In pursuit of his goal, Dr. Kraft has worked for four years using murine and nonhuman primate (NHP) pneumonia models under the mentorship of his sponsor, Dr. Claude Piantadosi, an expert in ALI and mitochondrial quality control mechanisms. Dr. Piantadosi has a record of successfully mentoring more than 40 junior investigators. The career development program proposed by Dr. Kraft incorporates laboratory training, formal didactics, attendance at scientific conferences, and an advisory committee composed of experts in S-nitrosothiol (SNO) biology and mitochondrial signaling mechanisms. During his Fellowship training, it became apparent that a critical cellular program for lung repair following ALI is mitochondrial biogenesis, the generation of new mitochondrial mass. Preliminary studies presented in this proposal indicate that mitochondrial biogenesis can be activated in lung alveolar type II epithelial (AT2) cells, the progenitor cells of the alveolar region, by pharmacologically augmenting the levels of total lung SNOs. SNO proteins have undergone S-nitrosylation, a post-translational modification whereby NO is transferred to the sulfur moieties of cysteine thiols. Preliminary data indicate that a potential mechanism for these findings is S-nitrosylation (and therefore inactivation) of the protein phosphatases PTEN and PHLPP that de-phosphorylate (de-activate) Akt1, a protein kinase activator of the transcriptional network for mitochondrial biogenesis. The central hypotheses of the proposal are that 1) SNOs activate mitochondrial biogenesis in AT2 cells via phosphatase inhibition leading to increased Akt1 phosphorylation and activation of key downstream repair genes; and 2) SNO-mediated induction of mitochondrial biogenesis will accelerate lung repair following bacterial pneumonia. These hypotheses will be tested with the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine if S-nitrosylation of (a) PTEN and/or (b) PHLPP activate Akt1 and mitochondrial biogenesis in lung AT2 cells; and 2) Determine if pharmacologic SNO augmentation can accelerate resolution of ALI following murine S. aureus pneumonia. This work is expected to yield important insight into why endogenous mechanisms may not be sufficient to resolve severe pneumonia with ALI as well as novel regulatory mechanisms of mitochondrial biogenesis that could be pharmacologically exploited to accelerate pneumonia resolution."
"9427555","The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3)."
"9552003","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The primary research question of the proposed study is this: Is a combination water-based physical exercise + cognitive training program for older veterans with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) feasible? The primary aims of the proposed research are: 1) demonstrate adequate recruitment and retention rates; 2) refinement of inclusion/exclusion criteria; and 3) further refine the combination water- based physical exercise + cognitive training (WATER+CT) intervention. These aims will be tested in a two-phase clinical trial with a single group design: 1 exercise training phase and 2) a cognitive training phase. The exercise training phase consists of a water-based physical exercise program that emphasizes cardiovascular fitness and strength training through a combination of non-weight bearing exercises that include land-based stretching and water-based activities. This 2-year pilot project will include 50 veterans diagnosed with amnestic MCI age 50-90. The exercise component consists of a six-month water-based exercise program followed by a four-week cognitive training program. For the first two months of the water-based exercise program, veterans will come to thrice-weekly group sessions at Aquatic Therapy Center at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. This will transition to a self-paced exercise program for the remaining four months. After completion of the exercise program, veterans will begin classroom-based cognitive training at the VAPAHCS. The cognitive training is based on an efficacious cognitive program that is structured around two components, pre-training and mnemonic training, both of which have been used successfully in persons with aMCI. Assessments of adherence will be administered throughout treatment and measures of feasibility will be completed post-treatment. Participants will complete a variety of neuropsychological measures taping into areas of cognition such as attention, executive functioning, and memory. To study possible predictors of treatment response, we will also collect biological (cardiovascular functioning and BDNF plasma levels) and genetic data (APOE and BDNF genotypes) from these participants. We hope to provide initial evidence of the feasibility of a water- based exercise training augmentation for cognitive training thus laying the  groundwork for full-scale clinical trials targeting the lessening of cognitive impairment in person with amnestic MCI by non-pharmacological means."
"9413315","SUMMARY Therapeutic immune checkpoint blocking antibodies and oncogene-targeted chemical inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment landscape for cancers, and now provide real hope to patients with advanced disease. However, while some patients will experience benefit, others will not respond at all ? a dilemma that is intimately linked to the genetic composition of the tumors. Identification of the molecular processes that enable, as well as preclude, positive responses to such therapies are urgently needed, and are likely to identify rational combinatorial approaches that will improve outcome. For immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, evidence has accumulated to suggest that the mutational burden in the patients' cancer, through an increased frequency of neoantigen peptides, causes immunogenicity. In order to grow, such antigenic tumors must develop mechanisms that enable them to evade immune-mediated destruction, which makes these tumors vulnerable to immune checkpoint therapies that reverses tumor immune evasion. From our ongoing studies on how melanoma cells elude the efficacy of oncogene-targeted therapies, we have identified an immunosuppressive molecule whose expression levels are directly linked to the tumors metabolic state. While oncogene-targeted therapies tend to cause an increased expression of melanoma antigens, which is triggered by altered metabolic demands and MITF-mediated regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis through PGC1???there is a drastic decrease in the levels of this immune suppressive molecule. Hence, these data suggested that increased immune surveillance may intersect with the effects of targeted therapies. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that oncogenic signaling governs transcriptional regulation of transcriptional regulation of this immune suppressive molecule, and that manipulation of its levels alters tumor growth in vivo, associated with changes in tumor immunogenicity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that heightened expression of this molecule is correlated with poor prognosis in patients who otherwise would be expected to benefit from immune checkpoint therapies. In this proposal, we will perform studies that dissect the molecular mechanisms that control this immune suppressive molecule's expression levels. We will further assess the degree to which this protein modifies the effects of immune checkpoint therapies, and determine if its prospective use might be used to inform clinical decisions. Successful completion of the proposed studies should improve clinical management and propose combinatorial targets for investigation.  "
"9421990","Project Summary Abstract Thorp/Luo The research described in this proposal will uncover the mechanistic basis and therapeutic potential for new targets for cardiac transplant. Recent findings reinforce the hypothesis that graft ischemia reperfusion injury/IRI is an independent risk factor for a more complicated clinical course. Specifically, increased cardiac troponin levels 24 hours after cardiac transplant and reperfusion are directly linked to chronic graft failure and vasculopathy. A critical component of reperfusion injury is the innate immune response, which includes monocytes and macrophages (M?s). Cutting edge findings reveal novel molecular links between innate M?s, and cells of the post-transplant chronic and adaptive immune response. This proposal will test the overall hypothesis that the consequences of innate M? action during perioperative cardiac allograft IRI, specifically govern subsequent alloreactivity, vasculopathy, and tolerance mechanisms by Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Critical regulators of both inflammation and tolerance are the TAM receptor tyrosine kinases/RTKs. TAMs, particularly MERTK, promote actin-driven apoptotic cell phagocytosis, or efferocytosis, by M?s. Independently, the tyrosine kinase domain of MERTK is also capable of transducing intracellular phospho-relay signals to suppress immune cell-activation and potentially, promote immune-tolerance. Our preliminary data suggest MERTK is antagonized by two mechanisms: MERTK destruction by ADAM proteases, and intracellular signaling by another TAM family member, i.e., AXL. We hypothesize that MERTK-mediated efferocytosis mitigates perioperative graft IRI, the consequences of which are linked to subsequent promotion of allograft tolerance. We hypothesize suboptimal perioperative allograft preservation, ADAM proteases, and AXL antagonize beneficial MERTK actions. In addition to testing these hypotheses, we will also test their therapeutic potential and human relevance."
"9455235","Learned associations between environmental stimuli and organism-effecting outcomes guide adaptive behavior. When healthy, this process results in increased rewards and decreased harm. Indicative of its foundational role in shaping behavior, associative learning dysfunction is comorbid in a host of neuropsychological pathologies including depression, addiction, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Increased characterization of neural mechanisms is necessary to improve the design of effective pharmacotherapeutic treatment strategies to address dysfunctional associative learning processes. Decades of research show the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a central role in the associative learning process. Recent technological innovations have enabled researchers to dissect the functional circuitry of this region to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Neurons arising from the BLA and projecting to the nucleus accumbens and centromedial amygdala have been shown to causally drive reward and fear learning, respectively. These two populations are interspersed anatomically in the BLA and exhibit similar morphological and electrophysiological profiles during both positive and negative valence (approach and avoidance, respectively) associations. How these neurons are selectively targeted and driven in opposing manners for opposing valence associations in the BLA is currently unknown. Our preliminary data suggests the neuropeptide neurotensin (NT) differentially affects learning in the two projecting populations. We hypothesize that afferents to BLA mediate the valence of learned associations through NT release. The proposed specific aims test this hypothesis through systematic identification, manipulation, and characterization of NT-releasing projections to BLA during Pavlovian fear and reward conditioning paradigms. Utilizing a combination of transgenic animal lines, optogenetic tools, and retrograde tracers, we will map this functional circuitry. CRISPR gene editing technology will enable assessment of the necessity of NT for functional associative learning. Photoidentification techniques will facilitate the contrasting of the electrophysiological activity of the NT input population to the general input population. Finally, we will photomanipulate NT neurons? activity directly to test if they are sufficient for valence encoding during associative learning. This innovative integration of cutting-edge approaches allows us to, for the first time, map out the dynamics and function of this neuropeptidergic input to BLA during associative learning. The findings from this work will greatly advance our understanding of a mechanism for valence encoding and increase knowledge of the functional role of a neuropeptide that may have pharmacotherapeutic possibilities."
"9404955","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethanol (EtOH) consumption results in its metabolism to a toxic intermediate, acetaldehyde (AcH). This reactive metabolite is further metabolized to acetate by enzymes in the Aldh superfamily. During times of heavy alcohol consumption, such as during binge drinking episodes, AcH is not efficiently metabolized to acetate and AcH accumulates, leading to cellular damage and some symptoms of alcohol poisoning. While much of EtOH metabolism occurs in the liver, other cell types are increasingly being shown to metabolize EtOH and exhibit sensitivity to the effects of its metabolism. Stem cells are capable of metabolizing EtOH and many stem cell types express high levels of EtOH-metabolizing enzymes. Because of the carcinogenicity and teratogenicity of EtOH, stem cell metabolism is highly relevant to developmental diseases and cancer. Many of the genetic and bioenergetics circuits that typify adult stem cells are also present in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), making them a relevant model for studying the metabolic consequences of EtOH metabolism in stem cells. However, the molecular mechanisms through which EtOH is metabolized in ESCs remain unclear. Compared to the adult liver, ESCs have different expression profiles of Aldh family members, with Aldh1A1, Aldh1A2, Aldh1B1, and Aldh2 all hypothesized to play roles in EtOH metabolism in stem cells. Preliminary data from our laboratory has shown that Aldh1A2 transcripts are increased by administration of 1 µM AcH and Aldh1A1 mRNA levels are decreased by 50 mM and 100 mM EtOH in ESCs. In addition, glycolysis substrates and precursors, and the acylcarnitine transporter SLC22A5 transcripts are increased following treatment of ESCs with EtOH, suggesting changes in energy metabolism. Consequently, we hypothesize that EtOH is metabolized by different Aldh family enzymes in ESCs compared to the adult liver, which leads to different metabolic phenotypes as a result of altered rates of AcH and acetate formation. We will address this hypothesis through a cell culture approach using shRNA technology and untargeted metabolomics. For Aim 1 I will determine which enzymes in the Aldh family metabolize AcH to acetate in ESCs. I will achieve this by knocking down expression of individual Aldh genes using shRNA against Aldh1A1, Aldh1A2, Aldh1A3, Aldh1B1, and Aldh2, and determining the ability of these enzymes to metabolize AcH to acetate once EtOH is added to the cells. In Aim 2 I will determine the metabolic signatures of ESCs following the addition of EtOH using an untargeted metabolomics approach. This will provide a high-throughput approach for identifying novel metabolites, cofactors, and pathways that contribute to EtOH actions in ESCs. Inhibition of Aldh activity using the Aldh inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde and by specific shRNA knockdown against individual Aldh family members shown to metabolize AcH will reveal pathways altered by the production of AcH from EtOH in ESCs. Completion of this project will increase our understanding of how stem cells metabolize EtOH and may provide insight into alleviation of EtOH-induced complications through dietary or pharmacological interventions."
"9426650","The human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene is regulated at the transcriptional level by a host of xenobiotic nuclear receptors (XNRs), including PXR, CAR, LXR?/?, PPAR? in addition to the Ah receptor and the antioxidant response factor Nrf2. Exposure of specific ligands that targets any of these receptors will lead to induction of the UGT1A1 gene. UGT1A1 is expressed in many tissues, but predominantly in the liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract in adults. In addition, the UGT1A1 gene is developmentally regulated, with greatly reduced expression in the liver and GI tract during neonatal development. Reduced expression of UGT1A1 during development plays an important physiological role because UGT1A1 is the sole glucuronosyltransferase responsible for the metabolism of serum bilirubin. During neonatal development, reduced UGT1A1 expression results in a build-up of serum bilirubin that is presented as either moderate or severe hyperbilirubinemia. While usually benign, severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (SNH) can lead to acute and chronic encephalopathy, abnormal behavior, opisthotonus, seizures, cerebellar hypoplasia, with potential linkages to autism spectrum disorders. Thus, we hypothesize that in those children that are at heightened risk for bilirubin induced neurotoxicity, controlling or accelerating the metabolism of bilirubin and reducing total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels would prevent neurotoxicity. We have recently generated humanized UGT1 (hUGT1) mice where the murine Ugt1 locus was replaced with the human UGT1 locus, including the human UGT1A1 gene. The human UGT1A1 gene is regulated in a tissue specific and developmental fashion that is concordant with its expression in human tissues. Importantly, hUGT1 mice develop SNH during the neonatal stage, providing us with a unique animal model to examine the regulatory properties of the UGT1A1 gene. We have recently established that SNH in hUGT1 mice can lead to seizures, cerebellar hypoplasia, with significant myelination defects, all of which can be reversed by inducing either liver or GI tract UGT1A1 gene expression. With this background, three significant discoveries, all identified with in the last 1-2 years and linking regulation of the UGT1A1 gene to SNH will be examined in this proposal. First, the liver UGT1A1 gene is actively repressed during the neonatal period by the corepressor protein SMRT (silencing mediatory of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor). Second, oral administration of isothiocyanates to neonatal hUGT1 mice, which are known to induce oxidative stress, dramatically induce liver UGT1A1 gene expression by activating liver CAR. Third, regulation of intestinal UGT1A1 expression during development is controlled by the corepressor protein NCoR1 (nuclear repressor corepressor). We have linked repression of intestinal UGT1A1 gene expression by NCoR1 with IKK? activity and oxidative stress. The regulatory events that we have outlined, each of which can reduce the risk of SNH, will be examined to unravel these novel mechanisms leading to expression of the human UGT1A1 gene."
"9308250","Many halogenated, persistent, and bioaccumulative contaminants have been classified as endocrine disrupters, and in many cases these contaminants negatively impact thyroid regulation. Many of these contaminants share similar chemical structures with thyroid hormones, including aromatic linkages, halogenated substitutents and hydroxylation of the aromatic rings. These structural similarities may result in competitive binding with the thyroid regulating enzymes, diodinases (DIs), which convert the pro-hormone,  thyroxine (T4), to the active hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), and/or to thyroid nuclear receptors. Very few studies have explored the impacts of these contaminants on tissue-specific hormone levels and Dl activity, and the potential consequences on development following early life exposure. Preliminary studies by the PI demonstrate that PBDEs decrease circulating thyroid hormones in fathead minnows, and inhibit Dl activity by more than 50% in vitro. Thus we propose that the mechanism, of thyroid toxicity involves impacts on deiodinase activity in tissues, affecting availability of T3 to bind to the thyroid nuclear receptors and activate  transcriptional events critical to growth and development. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that exposure to halogenated contaminants (PBDEs and triclosan) alters thyroid homeostasis via impacts on Dl activity and by competition with thyroid nuclear receptors. We propose to investigate this hypothesis using zebrafish as a model. The specific aims of this study are: 1. To examine structure-activity relationships between halogenated aromatic contaminants and inner and outer ring Dl activity in vitro; 2. To examine the influence of chemical structure on binding and activation of thyroid hormone nuclear receptors; 3. To examine impacts of PBDEs, chlorinated organophosphate compounds (e.g. chlorpyrifos), and BaP on Dl activity in the mixed neuronal/glial cell cultures used in the NBTA core; 4. To examine the effects of both acute and chronic exposure to PBDEs and triclosan on tissue-specific Dl activity, thyroid hormone levels, and mRNA expression of thyroid genes in embryonic and larval stage zebrafish exposed in vivo; and 5. Specific Aim 5: To determine if early life exposure to PBDEs and triclosan affects development and behavior."
"9431610","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this application for a 5-year K23 Career Development Award, I propose mentored research and career development leading toward a career as an independent clinical and translational investigator in interstitial lung disease. The goal of this research project is to identify the role of high-density lipoprotein in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a fatal lung disease that affects 1 out of 200 older adults and has a median survival of 3-5 years from diagnosis. Currently there is no medical therapy that improves symptoms or reverses fibrosis in IPF patients. This proposal builds upon my preliminary data showing that high levels of high density cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with a reduction in lung injury, inflammation and fibrosis (subclinical ILD) on CT in community-dwelling adults enrolled in the NHLBI-funded Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. These data are consistent with animal model data showing that treatment with apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I; the main component of HDL) attenuates lung fibrosis. Under the mentorship of Dr. David Lederer, I am therefore proposing to examine the associations of HDL and its main components (ApoA-I, ApoA-II, and paroxonase-1) with clinical outcomes and serum biomarkers of lung injury, inflammation and remodeling in adults with clinically-diagnosed IPF enrolled in Dr. Lederer's FAR-ILD study (Families At-Risk for ILD; R01 HL103676-06, scored 5th percentile Dec 2016). I will also explore the structure (using quantitative proteomics in Dr. Emily Chen's lab) and function (using a macrophage efflux assay in Dr. Alan Tall's lab) of HDL particles in adults with IPF as well as in two comparator groups: first-degree family members with subclinical ILD enrolled in the FAR-ILD study, and healthy controls. With guidance from my mentors, I have crafted a 5-year career development plan that includes training in lipoprotein biology (co-mentor: Dr. Tall), quantitative proteomics (co-mentor: Dr. Chen), clinical epidemiology (Dr. Lederer), and biostatistics (Dr. RoyChoudhury). In the last two years of the award I will apply for R01 funding and transition to independence. The proposed activities will prepare me to conduct patient-oriented and translational research to discover novel risk factors for IPF and other ILDs. I will also be prepared to design and conduct clinical trials targeting novel pathways (including those uncovered in this K23 proposal) to prevent and treat ILD."
"9460843","Ischemic stroke is the 4th leading cause of death in the U.S. and a major cause of disability. The etiology of stroke is multifactorial and poorly understood. Genetics is a potentially powerful tool for better understanding disease etiology as it can highlight biological mechanisms underlying disease and point the way to improved prevention and treatment. Efforts to decipher the genetic underpinnings of ischemic stroke have been hampered because of its heterogeneity. Our study addresses this problem by focusing on early-onset ischemic stroke (i.e., onset < 60 years), a particularly devastating manifestation of stroke because of its toll on child rearing and the ability to work. Early-onset ischemic stroke comprises ~ 20% of all first-ever stroke and this proportion is increasing. Studying early onset forms of other common genetic diseases (e.g., cancers, heart disease, diabetes) has provided valuable insights about disease etiology because of the enrichment of genetic causes. Our overall hypothesis is that early-onset ischemic stroke is enriched for genetic signals that may highlight biological mechanisms underlying stroke and point the way to improved prevention and treatment strategies. While the potential utility in studying early-onset ischemic stroke has been well recognized, a major limitation has been the accrual of large sample sizes. We have taken a large step to overcome the primary limitation of insufficient sample size by pulling together a multicenter early-onset stroke genetics consortium that includes up to 13,500 cases already genotyped for common and rare variants, the latter allowing us to test compelling hypotheses assessing the contribution of low frequency variants to early- onset stroke susceptibility.  The primary goals of our study are to detect common and rare variants associated with early-onset ischemic stroke through genome-wide association analysis of GWAS and exome arrays in up to 13,500 early- onset ischemic stroke cases and 94,000 controls from 16 participating cohorts. For the newly discovered stroke-associated loci, we will identify causal variants, genes, and pathways using multiple bioinformatics approaches. We will also determine if the newly discovered stroke-associated loci are also associated with older onset stroke and with serum levels of biomarkers reflective of prothrombotic activity. Finally, we will test for shared genetic risk between early-onset IS and deep venous thrombosis using polygenic risk scores and LD regression.  The successful identification of novel pathways and drug targets has the potential to transform our understanding of the stroke pathophysiology and lead to more effective preventive strategies. Our study will leverage the advantages of early-onset IS cases for genetic studies, and will also be the most well-powered examination to date of the role of rare variants in early onset IS etiology. The proposed study will establish a unique resource for continued studies of the genetic basis of IS, complementary to studies in older adults."

"9446631","In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65, insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3) potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3) use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of abnormality. This information is of vital importance to ensure that the reduction in lung cancer mortality reported by the NLST is achieved in the community setting."
"9476675","Summary/Abstract Our prior work in HIV cohort studies provides insights into the viral, inflammation, immune activation and antiretroviral therapy related risk factors for HIV-related CVD risk. Yet, an understanding of its pathophysiology remains incomplete. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota (GMB) altered during HIV infection correlates with increased immune activation and disrupted metabolite profiles, but the role of GMB in HIV- related CVD is unknown. Our preliminary data show that in HIV infection, progression of atherosclerosis is associated with higher circulating sCD14, a marker of monocyte activation, and increased tryptophan catabolism. This preliminary work presents two promising candidates linking GMB and CVD risk in HIV infection which we propose to study using integrated ?Omics? approaches. In addition to these hypothesis- driven study aims, we will also generate novel hypotheses linking GMB, host immune activation and metabolomics profiles associated with CVD risk. We will leverage the Women?s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) >20 year follow-up for biospecimens, atherosclerosis and other CVD measures, and HIV parameters. Our longitudinal semi-annual measures allow us to subset individuals according to long-term HIV treatment, disease progression markers (CD4+ T-cell count, viral load), and comorbidity, with inclusion of matched HIV-uninfected participants. In this project, We will extend our established collaborations with leading labs to gather multi-dimensional data among 400 women and men (~65% of whom are HIV+), including stool GMB metagenomics, serum and cellular inflammation and immunologic markers (sCD14, monocyte transcriptomics), metabolomics, and measures (carotid artery ultrasound imaging over 4 year follow-up). Findings from this intensively studied group will then be extended to a larger sample of 746 women and men with metabolomics and longitudinal atherosclerosis data. In this project, we will have the opportunity to identify immune activation and metabolites underlying the role of GMB in CVD, which may be specific to HIV+ individuals, or accentuated in the setting of HIV."
"9444869","Project Summary Background: Early integrated palliative care (PC), entailing monthly visits with a PC clinician in the outpatient setting throughout the course of illness for patients with advanced care, improves both patient-reported and end-of-life (EOL) care outcomes. However, few institutions possess a sufficient number of PC trained clinicians and resources to provide monthly visits with a PC clinician for all patients with advanced cancer. Additionally, such frequent visits with a PC clinician may not be necessary for patients with minimal physical or psychological symptoms. Stepped care is a health service delivery model to increase access to and efficiency of care when there is a limited number of specialty trained clinicians. In stepped care, all patients receive care with the minimal necessary time with the trained clinician, but are monitored systematically to ?step up? to more intensive treatment if they do not achieve sufficient health gain with low intensity treatment. Based upon our multidisciplinary teams' extensive experience developing and studying early integrated PC in oncology, we propose to adapt our effective outpatient PC model to a stepped care strategy to ensure all patients access PC service, while tailoring treatment delivery to patients' needs. Study Aims: The specific aims of this multi-center randomized trial are to demonstrate the non-inferiority of stepped PC to standard-of-care early integrated PC with respect to its effects on quality of life (primary outcome), as well as patient-clinician communication about EOL care preferences and length of stay in hospice. We will also compare PC resource utilization and the cost effectiveness of the two delivery models. Study Design and Methods: We will enroll and randomly assign 480 patients newly diagnosed with advanced lung cancer (240 per study group) to receive either stepped PC or early integrated PC. The trial will take place at Massachusetts General Hospital, Columbia University, and Duke University. Patients randomized to stepped PC will meet with the PC clinician at enrollment and at clinically relevant points in their illness. We will assess participants' quality of life every six weeks to detect stepped care patients whose quality of life is deteriorating to allow them to step up to monthly PC visits. Patients randomized to early integrated PC will participate in monthly visits with the PC clinician throughout their course of illness. In addition to quality of life, all participants will complete measures to assess their health status, mood, coping, prognostic understanding, and communication about their EOL care preferences every 12 weeks for one year. We will also collect data from the medical record and hospital cost accounting system on hospice use, PC resource utilization, and health care costs. Conclusions: Early integrated PC improves patient-reported outcomes, including quality of life and mood, and the delivery of EOL care. Based upon data demonstrating the efficacy of this care model, several national organizations recommend early integrated PC as standard of care. We seek to establish the non-inferiority of a stepped PC model compared with early integrated PC, as a more efficient, accessible, patient-centered, and scalable approach to provide early PC."
"9529747","Candida albicans is a deadly pathogen responsible for thousands of infections and deaths in the United States each year. This pathogen infects multiple host tissues by adapting to combinatorial stresses present in diverse microenvironments. C. albicans adapts to these environments through changes in gene expression. While pioneering studies have shown that changes in mRNA levels occur during the course of infection, other work in multiple organisms has shown that the translatome ? the population of mRNAs that are actively translated ? often differs greatly from the transcriptome. Little is known about the translatome employed by C. albicans during infection. Addressing this knowledge gap will have significant impacts on our understanding of fungal virulence mechanisms. The objective of this application is to survey the population of translated mRNA from C. albicans during infection of a mammalian host. This will be accomplished through two specific aims; 1. Measure the dynamic translatome of C. albicans in two mouse models of infection using RiboTags and RNA-seq; and 2. Identify novel translated regions used by C. albicans during infection of a mammalian host. In the first aim, we will use our RiboTag strain of C. albicans to isolate the translatome from infected tissues and measure it using high-throughput sequencing. We will use both public and our own computational tools to identify genes whose protein synthesis changes over the course of systemic and oropharyngeal infection. We will also compare out translatome measurements to published transcriptome data to identify candidate cis-regulatory elements important for virulence. In aim 2, we will use Ribosome profiling from immunoprecipitated C. albicans ribosomes to identify novel translated regions. Novel peptides encoded by these regions will be tested for roles in virulence in mice. This approach is innovative in that it uses a novel approach to study the translatome in infected tissue and is expected to reveal new regulatory mechanisms used during infection. We expect the proposed research will generate new hypotheses regarding gene regulation during infection and open fresh avenues for future research into C. albicans virulence."
"9594467","Project Summary Two coding sequence genetic variants in APOL1 commonly found in people of Western Sub-Saharan Africa ancestry (SSAA) are associated with kidney diseases such as Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Hypertension Attributed-End Stage Kidney Disease, and HIV-Associated Nephropathy(HIVAN). The presence of 2 APOL1- risk alleles in SSAA deceased donors is associated with 2-to-4-times higher risk of renal graft loss in the recipient. Living donors with APOL1 risk alleles may be at risk for kidney disease and excluded from donating. This application seeks to establish a large consortium of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO) and Transplant Centers called the APOLLO-CREED?APOL1 Long-term Outcomes-Consortium for Responsible and Ethical Evaluation of organ Donation to: 1) define the outcomes of transplantation from a donor with 2 APOL1 risk alleles to guide clinical and cost-effective organ use, and define the health outcomes of living donors according to APOL1 genotype to guide living donor selection; 2) quantify outcomes of non- renal (e.g. liver) organs transplanted from donors with two APOL1 risk alleles; and 3) inform the ethical foundation of APOL1 testing for deceased donor allocation and living donor selection. To accomplish these goals, the APOLLO-CREED will consist of over 10 Organ Procurement Organizations and over 20 large and small volume, adult and pediatric Transplant Centers, from a wide geographical area to collect blood and clinical data from living and deceased donors of African Ancestry (AA) and from recipients of organs from these donors. Biospecimens for APOL1 genetic analysis will be mailed directly to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Clinical outcomes of all recipients of organs from donors at risk for APOL1 alleles will be ascertained through linkage to data already collected by the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) as captured in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) databases and uploaded to the DCC. Health outcomes for living donors/candidates will be integrated through linkage to the new SRTR ?Living Donor Collective.? Cost data linked to the SRTR are also available and will be used to support cost-effectiveness analyses that could inform national allocation policy. A bioethicist with transplant experience will assist in the design and performance of the study and aid in the translation of the results to widespread clinical use. This efficient study design requires minimal time, effort, and cost from OPOs and Transplant Centers."
"9406883","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hospital environment was designed for treatment of acute illnesses, and has evolved unsystematically over the past century based on financial, demographic, and political pressures. We have become expert at treating acute cardiac events in particular, but new evidence suggests that hospitalization itself may weaken our patients -- rendering them susceptible to a host of maladies while they recover. A recent study of 500,000 cardiac admissions found that 1 out of every 5 patients was rehospitalized within 30 days of their discharge. Surprisingly, only half of those rehospitalizations were for cardiac reasons. Because of new financial regulations in the Affordable Care Act that tie reimbursement to rehospitalization rates, hospitals are highly motivated to decrease these early rehospitalizations. A new model of posthospital syndrome (PHS) suggests that the stress of hospitalization itself confers increased risk of rehospitalization because it places patients in a transient state of generalized risk. Testing this model, and identifying hospital environment and patient factors that place patients at risk, are crucial for directing hospital efforts to reduce 30-day rehospitalizations. The first goal of this proposed research is to test the PHS model to explain the high risk of all-cause rehospitalization experienced by cardiac patients in the 30 days after they are discharged. The second goal is to identify modifiable hospital factors that contribute most to PHS, and by doing so detect targets for reducing early hospital readmissions. The third goal is to identify patient factors, such as personality and social support that may be associated with PHS, so that we can ultimately conduct risk stratification and improve patients' successful transition to independent post-hospital care. We plan to enroll a consecutive cohort of 1,000 cardiac patients who are admitted through the emergency department (ED), follow them throughout their hospitalization, and identify 30-day rehospitalizations. We will assess 4 in-hospital risk factors: stress using ecological momentary assessment (EMA); sleep and physical activity by actigraphy; and weight loss by electronic scale. We will also objectively assess hospital factors that may contribute to stress: stressful environmental factors (degree of ED crowding and length of stay [LOS]; excess noise and lighting throughout hospitalization). Further, we will measure patient factors that may influence the hospital experience, including personality, social support, cardiac severity, and physical and psychiatric comorbidities during and after hospitalization. Finally, we will test whether in-hospital stress (and secondarily, physical activity, sleep, or weight loss) contribute to 30-day rehospitalizations. More than 1 million cardiac patients are hospitalized in the US annually, and 20% are rehospitalized within 30 days. All of the factors that have been hypothesized to contribute to PHS are modifiable, but evidence of their association to rehospitalization is required to motivate change. This study would be the first to test whether change is warranted, and to provide targets for intervention. As such, the impact of this research is substantial."
"9530226","Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in infants, and causes severe respiratory morbidity and mortality in the elderly, for which no effective treatment or vaccine is currently available. RSV infections have also been linked to the development and severity of asthma. Given the high annual incidence and wide range in the severity of illness caused by RSV, a biomarker capable of accurately and consistently predicting disease severity and post-acute outcomes of RSV infection is sorely needed. Previous studies have shown elevated neurotrophins, leukotrienes, and cytokines in RSV bronchiolitis as potential biomarkers; however, no mechanism-based biomarkers of RSV infection have yet been validated for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes. In this study, we will dissect the role of post-translationally modified High Mobility Group Box-1 (HMGB1) in disease severity, and its secretion in activation of immune cells to promote inflammatory responses, and will investigate whether HMGB1 and its associated signaling pathways represent valid, prognostic biomarkers of RSV infection. HMGB1 is a multifunctional protein that serves as both a DNA regulatory protein and an extracellular cytokine signaling molecule that promotes inflammation as a damage-associated molecular pattern. The precise extracellular secretion mechanism for HMGB1 is not fully understood, but it is secreted after extensive post-translational modifications (PTMs). Recent studies have highlighted the importance of PTMs in HMGB1 function and release mechanisms. Specifically, secreted HMGB1 has been shown to undergo extensive PTMs such as acetylation, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and methylation that promote active transport of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the extracellular space. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that RSV infection hyperacetylates/phosphorylates HMGB1, thus leading to significant active release of HMGB1 from airway epithelial cells, and that secreted HMGB1 activates primary human monocytes to promote the inflammatory response. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that upon RSV infection, extensive PTMs of HMGB1, including hyperacetylation of lysine residues and serine phosphorylation within the nuclear localization sequence sites, promote HMGB1 mobilization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and its subsequent extracellular release in airway epithelial cells, and that secreted HMGB1 activates signaling cascades to promote inflammation. Aim 1 will determine the role of HMGB1 PTMs in its extracellular release, immune cell activation and proinflammatory signaling, and test whether HMGB1 deacetylation through deacetylase enzyme SIRT 1 activation would inhibit RSV-induced HMGB1 acetylation and its proinflammatory activity. Aim 2 will determine whether distinct HMGB1 expression and/or PTM profile(s) at the airway mucosa can discriminate between infants with different severities of illness after naturally- acquired RSV infections. The outcome of these studies will have important therapeutic implications not only for RSV infection, but also for other respiratory diseases that affect human population of all age."
"9543918","ABSTRACT Vertical transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the single most common congenital infection worldwide, often resulting in deafness and neurodevelopmental delay for afflicted children. CMV related neurologic complications are more frequent and severe following primary maternal infection during pregnancy, and therefore a vaccine to prevent maternal acquisition of CMV during pregnancy is the leading strategy to reduce the incidence of congenital CMV disease. The most successful maternal immunization regimen tested to date is a CMV glycoprotein B (gB) subunit vaccine combined with MF59 adjuvant, which achieved a promising 50% efficacy in multiple phase II clinical trials. However, efforts to improve this vaccine have been slowed by an incomplete understanding of the determinants of protection provided by this moderately-effective vaccine. Previous studies and recent work in our nonhuman primate model of congenital CMV transmission have indicated that maternal CMV-specific antibody responses modulate the risk of congenital CMV infection. Yet there remains major a gap in knowledge impeding further vaccine development on: (1) what antibody functions must be elicited by an efficacious vaccine to prevent congenital CMV and (2) whether antibody responses targeting the gB protein alone, and not other CMV glycoproteins, are sufficient for an effective vaccine. The development of novel, high-throughput methods within the vaccine immunology field has made it possible to investigate epitope targets/antibody functions protective of CMV acquisition as well as mechanisms of viral immune evasion. Interestingly, gB/MF59-elicited plasma antibodies were generally non-neutralizing, and therefore vaccine-induction of neutralizing antibodies does explain the 50% partial efficacy observed in human clinical trial. Thus, we hypothesize that the efficacy of gB/MF59 vaccination is dependent upon non- neutralizing antibody effector functions and viral immune evasion of the gB-targeted responses. We will first identify the fine specificities, properties, and effector functions of vaccine-elicited antibodies in gB/MF59 recipients using multiplex ELISA, linear peptide binding, Fc glycosylation/FcR binding, and assessment of non- neutralizing activities (ADCC and ADCP). Second, through deep sequencing of viral variants and subsequent viral ?sieve analysis,? we will investigate sequence diversity at the loci of gB antigenic epitopes to determine if viral immune evasion of antibody responses is associated with vaccine failure. This work will address research priorities for CMV vaccine development, and will thus set the stage for rational design of a future glycoprotein- based vaccine for the elimination of congenital CMV infection."
"9447371","Project Summary DJ-1 is a cytoprotective protein that is activated by oxidative stress. Due in large part to the association of DJ-1 with Parkinson's Disease, most studies aimed at investigating its role in response to pathological stimuli have been confined to the brain or neuronal cells. However, DJ-1 is expressed in the heart where it also possesses cytoprotective actions. Studies indicate that DJ-1 plays an important role in multiple cellular processes, including oxidative stress response, anti-apoptotic signaling, and transcriptional regulation. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these reported actions remain largely unknown. Given that DJ-1 is a small, dimeric, single-domain protein, it either possesses multiple functions to account for these actions or there is a single biochemical activity that explains all of them. What is known is that DJ-1 is activated by the removal of a 15-amino acid peptide at its C terminus in response to oxidative stress. We recently provided the first evidence that DJ-1 is activated within hours following the onset of acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Preliminary studies from our lab demonstrate that cardiac DJ-1 remains active for up to 7 days following the onset of ischemic injury. Furthermore, our studies revealed that DJ-1 deficient mice displayed worse cardiac dysfunction in response to ischemic-induced heart failure compared to wild-type mice. Elevated levels of hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation accompanied the worse cardiac dysfunction in the DJ-1 deficient mice. More importantly, we provide novel evidence that the delivery of the active form of DJ-1 using recombinant adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9-DJ1WT?C) reduces the development of ischemic-induced heart failure. This is the first and only demonstration that an active form of DJ-1 provides cytoprotection in an in vivo model of injury. In this proposal, we will expand on our previous findings and attempt to fill knowledge gaps in the literature regarding the cellular actions of DJ-1. 3 specific aims have been proposed. Aim 1 will determine if DJ- 1 is a novel cardiac deglycase that opposes glycative stress. Aim 2 will determine if DJ-1 attenuates ischemic- induced heart failure by promoting the cardioprotective actions of thioredoxin. Aim 3 will determine if DJ-1 opposes TGF-? signaling by regulating the cardiac expression of Arkadia."
"9511348","Project Summary/Abstract The emergence of mosquito-borne viruses is, unfortunately, not rare in modern society. This is exemplified by the introduction and rapid spread of West Nile virus in North America during the late 1990's, and chikungunya virus in the Indian Ocean region and the Americas. The primary facilitators of emergence are human activities, including globalization, climate change, and urbanization. In the examples of West Nile and chikungunya viruses, however, successful establishment was partially attributed to the virus adapting to local environments. Now, Zika virus has emerged within the Americas and threatens to infect millions. Compounding the situation, is the recently discovered association of the virus with severe congenital defects and neuropathologies. The unexpected scale and severity of the Zika virus epidemic led several scientists to hypothesize that this may also be related to recent evolutionary events in the virus. The keys to understanding functional virus evolution during epidemics are (1) genomic surveillance and (2) experimental investigation of functional aspects of virus genetics. The lack of Zika virus genetic data, however, means that evolutionary hypotheses of Zika virus emergence remain untested. Via large-scale collaborations, we recently developed methods to successfully sequence Zika virus directly from clinical and mosquito samples, which led to a major expansion of available genomic data of the virus. As part of this work, we identified several Zika virus amino acid changes that dominate in distinct geographical regions. In this proposal, we will assess functional and fitness effects related to Zika virus mutations in mosquito and human environments. Combined with monitoring their spread via continued genomic surveillance, we will develop a model to investigate if the Zika virus epidemic could have been augmented by functional virus evolution. We propose the following aims: Aim 1: In-depth genomic surveillance of the Zika virus epidemic. By sequencing Zika virus from mosquito and clinical samples, we will (1) continuously monitor virus evolution, (2) create a large catalog of virus mutations, (3) identify where each mutation is geographically present, and (4) evaluate the epidemic process. Aim 2: Fitness of Zika virus mutations circulating in the Americas. Using a reverse genetics platform, we will experimentally evaluate the fitness and function of each identified clade-defining mutation in mosquito and human experimental systems, to determine how they impact transmission and clinical disease. Our proposed aims will provide insights into the genetic determinants of Zika virus disease and emergence. Moreover, the studies outlined here will provide a framework for evaluating functional virus evolution during fast-paced outbreaks."
"9540377","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most deadly form of stroke, and those that survive carry a high burden of long-term disability. ICH is an acute manifestation of progressive small vessel disease (CSVD), a condition that collectively causes ICH and small vessel (SV) ischemic stroke, cognitive decline, late-life depression, and gait deterioration. Because we have found shared epidemiologic and genetic risk factors among ICH and other CSVD manifestations, understanding the biological foundations of ICH offers the opportunity to develop effective treatment and prevention strategies across CSVD. Through prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we have identified three promising gene-rich loci, 1q22, 13q34, and 16q24, carrying associations with both ICH and SV stroke. These loci are united by a common theme in which associated variants are located in regions enriched for non-coding regulatory roles, rather than protein-coding function. Identification of causal functional variants and their regulatory mechanisms must occur before this knowledge can be applied to improve stroke care. Our proposal is motivated by (A) well-powered GWAS of ICH and small vessel stroke as well as preliminary targeted sequencing data suggesting a prominent regulatory role for ICH-associated variants at these loci, (B) the availability of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data on large populations with ICH and ischemic stroke for well- powered association testing at these loci, and (C) accumulated expertise in translational genomic approaches that can link genetic variants to functional biological effects, bridging the gap between disease association results and biological consequence. This proposal serves our central hypothesis that exploring the functional impact of genetic associations in ICH will yield biological insights that will identify novel treatment targets and advance the search for therapeutic strategies with bedside applications. Our proposal, entitled ?Sequencing Annotation and Functional Analysis of Risk in ICH?, or SAFARI-ICH, will leverage NIH-supported WGS efforts from NHLBI TOPMed and the NHGRI Centers for Common Disease Genomics to comprehensively determine 1) which particular sequence and structural variants at 1q22, 13q34, and 16q24 predispose to CSVD, 2) which of these associated variants, using annotation and cross-phenotype analyses, are most likely to reflect causal biology, and 3) what effect these putative causal variants have on gene transcription at these and other loci using relevant cellular models. Our approach leverages NIH investment in WGS at no cost to this proposal, allowing resources to be devoted to identifying the causal variants and their functional ramifications in ICH and SV stroke. Because our approach is designed to characterize variants with an impact on gene regulation at the cellular level, this proposal offers a unique opportunity to deliver insight into ICH pathobiology and highlight potential targets for future treatment of ICH and other adverse and highly prevalent CSVD manifestations."
"9469957","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patients with single-sided deafness (SSD) report significant difficulty understanding speech and localizing sound, especially when the sounds originate on the deaf side. Recently, some SSD patients have received a cochlear implant (CI) in their deaf ear. Current fitting strategies aim to maximize speech perception through the CI alone by allocating all spectral information across the electrode array without regard to tonotopic placement of each electrode along the basilar membrane. In this study, we propose a new fitting philosophy for patients with one acoustic-hearing ear, whereby CI maps are designed to best complement information from the normal-hearing (NH) ear. In Aim 1, we investigate the mechanisms of binaural temporal-envelope beat sensitivity in NH listeners using bandpass filtered pulse trains with parameters including stimulus level, filter bandwidth, filter slope, and spectral overlap using bandpass filtered pulse trains. We find the minimum baseline ITD and spectral mismatch that NH listeners can tolerate while maintaining their ability to detect ITDs. New and experienced SSD+CI listeners will complete similar tasks and the results will be used to adjust their CI maps in an effort to reduce the frequency-mismatch between the NH and CI ear. In Aim 2, we will measure sound localization and speech understanding in noise to compare performance with the standard clinical map and the new experimental map based on a closer between-ear spectral match. Performance will be measured over time to ensure sufficient exposure and allow time for adjustment. In the localization task, we present listeners with stimuli designed to separate the relative contributions of interaural level differences and interaural time differences in SSD+CI patients. In the first speech-in-noise experiment, we will measure speech recognition performance in three spatial configurations using two masker types: speech-shaped noise and two- talker babble. By employing both energetic (noise) and informational (two-talker babble) maskers, we will test the hypothesis that improvement in localization produced by a frequency-to-place maps are superior to standard clinical maps especially in cases where the binaural benefit goes beyond ?better ear? performance to encompass complex listening situations where informational masking dominates. The outcomes of this study will provide new information on binaural interactions in SSD patients with a CI, and may provide a new and more successful approach to fitting a CI in cases where considerable residual hearing exists in the contralateral ear."
"9403206","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammalian hibernation is a unique and potent strategy for survival in winter when food and water are not available. Our hypothesis is that some of the mechanisms utilized for protection against the stress in winter, might also be used to protect ischemic myocardium, even though hibernating mammals do not have coronary artery disease or myocardial ischemia. The focus of this proposal is to examine the woodchucks' protection in winter against complete coronary artery occlusion and its consequences of remodeling and the development of heart failure. After a complete occlusion of a coronary artery the major mechanism that can ameliorate the effects of ischemia relate to the coronary vessels and development of angiogenesis, which is supported by the preliminary data in this application. Our preliminary data also indicate that vascular stiffness and the composition of vessels are altered in winter thereby permitting enhanced blood flow. Potential cellular mechanisms include cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). It is important to keep in mind that these studies will be conducted for the first time in a natural model of cardioprotection, quite different from traditional studies in experimental animal models or genetically altered mice. Our Hypothesis: Woodchucks prepare for winter by developing mechanisms that extensively modify their blood vessels resulting in reduced vascular stiffness and induction of new coronary vessels, which provide blood flow to the ischemic heart and attenuate heart failure development and remodeling after chronic, complete coronary artery occlusion."
"9425827","Project Background: Prostate cancer is the leading male cancer. One in three men with prostate cancer is chemically castrated at some point with long-acting injectable drugs (i.e., androgen deprivation therapy or ADT). This impacts the well-being of thousands of men annually. Although some patients benefit in terms of survival and symptom improvement, chemical castration with ADT is also commonly performed when there are little to no health benefits to patients raising questions of low value care. A growing awareness of castration harms (e.g., heart attack, osteoporosis, loss of sexual function) creates patient safety concerns. Despite this, ADT use in low value cases, such as for localized prostate cancer treatment persists. Ineffective and harmful practices such as chemical castration of prostate cancer patients with ADT outside of the evidence base are ideal targets for de-implementation. De-implementation, or stopping low value practices, has the potential to improve patient outcomes and decrease healthcare costs. However, provider preferences regarding de-implementation are not well understood, and possible de-implementation interventions range from blunt formulary restriction policies to shared decision-making. Both intervention strategies need tailoring based on provider input for acceptability and feasibility in clinical practice, including piloting prior to trialing. As many medical practices lack evidence and cause harm, robust, behavioral theory-based methods for incorporating provider preferences into deimplementation strategy development will advance both implementation research and practice. Project Objectives: This study will use a theory-based, mixed methods approach to identify, tailor and pilot two different de-implementation strategies that vary widely in delivery, impact, and expected results for reducing low value ADT use, in preparation for a randomized comparative effectiveness trial. Project Methods: This innovative mixed-methods research program has three aims. Aim 1: To assess preferences and barriers for de-implementation of chemical castration in prostate cancer. Guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework, urologists from facilities with the highest castration rates across an integrated delivery system will be interviewed to identify key preferences and de-implementation barriers for reducing castration as prostate cancer treatment. This qualitative work will inform Aim 2 while gathering rich information for two proposed pilot intervention strategies. Aim 2: To use a discrete choice experiment, a novel barrier prioritization approach, for de-implementation strategy tailoring. A national survey of urologists will prioritize key barriers identified in Aim 1 for stopping castration as localized prostate cancer treatment using a discrete choice experiment design. These quantitative results will identify the most important barriers to be addressed through tailoring of two pilot de-implementation strategies in preparation for Aim 3 piloting. Aim 3: To pilot two tailored de-implementation strategies to reduce castration as localized prostate cancer treatment. Building on findings from Aims 1 and 2, two de-implementation strategies will be piloted. One strategy will focus on formulary restriction at the organizational level and the other on physician/patient decision-making. Outcomes will include acceptability, feasibility, and scalability in preparation for an effectiveness trial comparing these two widely varying de-implementation strategies. This innovative approach to de-implementation strategy development will transform how and why castration is performed for localized prostate cancer through combining provider preferences and strategy tailoring. This work will advance de-implementation science for low value cancer care and foster participation in a subsequent de- implementation evaluation trial by addressing preferences and concerns through pilot tailoring."
"9528183","Summary  Exercise robustly enhances cognitive performance across the lifespan but the mechanisms are not well understood. The long-term goal of this research program is to elucidate the neurological mechanisms by which exercise improves cognition. The objective of this application is to determine the origin of exercise-induced hippocampal neurogenesis and enhanced behavioral performance, whether from contracting muscles or acute activation of the hippocampus during physical exertion. Recent work has emphasized the importance of the muscle-brain axis and has assumed the main signals originate from skeletal muscle. On the other hand, there is a large and well established literature illustrating a close correlation between neural activation of the hippocampus and the speed of movement. Results will provide crucial information for deciding whether to focus on the muscle secretome or mechanisms within the brain for recapitulating pro-cognitive effects of exercise. The rationale is to develop better strategies for neuronal regeneration and repair and for ameliorating cognitive deficits associated with neurological disorders. The central hypothesis is that both muscle contractions and hippocampal neuronal activation each independently enhance neurogenesis and related behaviors. The hypothesis is supported by preliminary studies showing that both repeated electrical contractions of the hindlimb muscles and activation of hippocampal neurons increases hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. One of the PIs has a productive research program on exercise induced-neurogenesis and measuring behavioral performance in mice, and the other has expertise on muscle physiology and electrical stimulation. Moreover, the PIs have developed multiple innovative methods for powerful hypothesis testing. The objectives of this application will be accomplished by pursuing 2 specific aims: 1) Determine the extent to which repeated electrical contraction of the hindlimb muscles is sufficient to increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis and enhance learning and memory. 2) Determine the extent to which optogenetic activation of the dentate gyrus in a pattern that mimics running is sufficient for exercise-induced neurogenesis and enhanced behavioral performance. An established procedure for electrically contracting the hindlimb muscles will be used to repeatedly contract the muscles while the mouse is anesthetized. State-of-the-art optogenetic methods will be used to instantaneously activate dentate gyrus granule neurons that were acutely and transiently activated in response to running and to measure the long-term effects on neurogenesis and behavior. Elucidating and unequivocally establishing mechanisms underlying pro-cognitive effects of exercise holds the key to discover novel and more efficient ways to maintain, promote and improve cognitive performance. The proposed research is highly innovative, it addresses pressing questions in the field using very novel strategies and state-of-art optogenetics technology that will allow us to generate causal, mechanistic data on the origin of exercise's effects on neurogenesis and cognitive performance."
"9516310","The most recent outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic posed a major threat to the world. Because the mechanisms of EBOV infection remain obscure, there is still no specific treatment or vaccine for EBOV disease. While EBOV-host cell attachment has been shown to depend critically on the molecular biomechanics of interaction between receptors on the cell surface and the outer coat of the virus, the quantitative understanding essential for guiding the development of therapies is completely lacking. Recent work has established the importance of TIM family proteins and the geometry and mechanical properties of its mucin-like stalk domain (MLD). However, further progress building on these recent findings requires expertise in experimental and theoretical molecular biomechanics, different than that which has advanced our knowledge so far. This proposal takes advantage of the PIs? capabilities in single-molecule force spectroscopy (Zhang) and computational molecular adhesion mechanics (Jagota) to address the problem of establishing quantitative understanding of the molecular, cellular, and biomechanical mechanisms of EBOV attachment to a host cell. We hypothesize that quantitative knowledge about the biomechanical properties of the stalk presenting the ligand binding IgV domain, i.e., the length, rigidity and charge of the MLD of TIM, can be used to predict conditions for EBOV attachment. Aim 1 will utilize single-molecular force spectroscopy to characterize experimentally how TIM family proteins interact with EBOV in a rate- and force- dependent fashion, and how the interaction is influenced by the length, rigidity and charge of MLD. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis by developing biomechanical models that show how single-molecule biomechanical properties, and how the properties of the MLD, such as its length, rigidity, and charge density, control TIM mediated cellular/viral membrane adhesion and engulfment. Model development will be calibrated and validated through single-molecule measurements. The study will elucidate quantitatively?for the first time?the biomechanical mechanism of EBOV?host cell interaction, providing potential new targets for antiviral drug development."
"9472087","Cutaneous squamous cell cancer (cSCC) is one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in the USA striking 200,000 Americans annually. Exposure to Solar UVB (ultraviolet B) radiation is the primary etiologic factor for skin cancer. In organ transplant patients there is a 65?100 fold increased incidence of cSCC compared to the general population. Targeted agents have been identified in other common skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma and melanoma but not for cSCC. Thus, novel mechanism-based targeted approaches are needed for both prevention and treatment of aggressive cSCC. Further, excision of cSCC of the head & neck results in significant facial disfigurement and thus chemoprevention for patients with condemned skin is critical. In our preliminary studies, systemic administration and topical application of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor AZD4547 significantly decreased UVB-induced epidermal hyperplasia and hyper proliferation in SKH- 1 mice. Further, inhibition of FGFR was associated with downregulation of the mTOR and AKT signaling pathway. AZD4547 also inhibited cSCC cell survival, migration and motility that translated into decrease tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model. Interestingly, deletion of FGFR receptor subtype; FGFR2 significantly decreased mTOR and AKT signaling in cSCC cells suggesting an important role of FGFR2 in AZD4547-mediated effects. Prior published studies demonsrtated a protective role of FGFR2b in the skin. However, it is important to understand that the role of FGFR2b in the skin is highly context dependent and critical experiments are needed to clearly identify its role in the pathogenesis of UVB-induced skin cancer. Based on our preliminary data, our central hypothesis is targeting FGFR and selectively FGFR2 is critical for prevention of cSCC. Accordingly, in Aim1, we will determine temporal effects of AZD4547 on UVB-induced acute epidermal hyperplasia and hyper proliferation. In addition, we will also assess the effects of AZD4547 on UVB-induced tumor promotion and progression. Aim2 will determine the time course for UVB-induced FGFR activation and assess the effect of FGFR inhibition on downstream FGFR signaling. Using K14.CreERT2 x FGFR2bflox/flox mice, the role of FGFR2b in modulating UVB-induced mTORC1 and AKT activation will also be assessed. In addition, the source and type of FGFR2 ligands-induced by UVB in the skin will also be studied. Aim3 will primarily focus on establishing the role of FGFR2 in UVB-induced epidermal hyperplasia, apoptosis and skin carcinogenesis. Further, the role of FGFR2 in inhibiting the progression of premalignant lesions to tumors will be studied. Finally, in Aim4, we will establish FGFR2, pFGFR2 and pS6 as predictive markers for cSCC and tumor aggressiveness and as a potential target for treatment of cSCC. We will also evaluate its efficacy in inhibiting growth of Patient-Derived Xenografts. The ultimate goal is to provide an understanding for the role of FGFR and selectively FGFR2 in UVB-induced skin cancer which will lead to development of targeted agents that could prevent and treat cSCC."
"9308249","Developmental neurotoxicity is one of the most sensitive outcomes of environmental chemical exposures. In past grant periods, we showed how exposures to otherwise unrelated agents can nevertheless produce similar outcomes because of convergence on adverse effects targeted towards specific neurotransmitter pathways, particularly acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin (5HT). These are the same transmitters affected by common prenatal exposures to nicotine in maternal smoking, or dexamethasone as used in the therapy of preterm infants, raising the likelihood that these exposures create a subpopulation that will be sensitive to developmental neurotoxicants. In the current study, we will examine the ability of such treatments to sensitize the developing brain to subsequent exposure to chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide, and will then extend the approach to agents being evaluated in other projects and cores within the Center (polybrominated flame retardants, polyaromatic hydrocarbons). There are three aims:    1. To determine how fetal exposure to nicotine, in a model simulating nicotine levels in human smokers, sensitizes the developing brain to subsequent postnatal chlorpyrifos exposure. Neurotransmitter pathways and behavioral outcomes will be assessed in the rat. Mechanisms will be evaluated in three neural cell culture models (PCI2, mixed fetal neuronal and glial cultures, neural stem cell cultures).  2. To determine how fetal exposure to dexamethasone, in a model simulating its use in preterm labor, sensitizes the developing brain to subsequent postnatal chlorpyrifos exposure. The same approach is used as in Aim 1: studies in rats to determine neurotransmitter pathways underlying effects on behavioral outcomes, along with cell culture models to identify cellular mechanisms of injury.  3. To extend this approach to two suspected neurotoxicants of different classes, identified in other projects within the Center. PBDE99 as a representative of the polybrominated flame retardants and benzo[a]pyrene as a representative of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons."
"9308257","The Training Core will provide educational support for all the projects and cores of the Duke University SRC. The focus of the next phase of the Duke SRC is to determine the biological costs of early life toxicant exposures, the biologic mechanisms for developmental impairments and remediation strategies to reduce impacts on humans and ecosystems. This will serve as a unifying theme for activities undertaken by the Training Core. Core components will include continuation of our weekly seminar series and semi-annual focused topic symposia and workshops, and a new initiative to train undergraduate students in research  methods of environmental toxicology, chemistry and policy research. The Training Core will recruit and support promising undergraduate students to work in each of the projects and cores, providing direct mentored research experience. Duke has a unique feature: the College of Arts and Sciences, Medical School, Nicholas School of the Environment, and Pratt School of Engineering are not only on the same campus, but are immediately adjacent to each other. This facilitates the integration of diverse approaches to solving environmental problems. A weekly seminar series will feature local and national speakers on the full  range of topics relevant to the SRC. These seminars will provide students, postdoctoral fellows, technicians, and faculty with the latest research findings, especially as they relate to biological costs of early life exposures. We will host workshops on state-of-the-art scientific techniques, as well as on scientific communication skills to help us effectively convey our research to scientific colleagues and the broader society. A daylong interdisciplinary symposium will be held on a focused area of environmental pollution to learn, in depth, the ways in which specific pollution problems can be effectively addressed in a collaborative effort. Monthly chalk talks will be held in which all of the projects will in turn discuss their latest results and plans for future studies. Travel and registration funding will be provided for SRC undergraduate, graduate students, and post-doctoral research associates to attend relevant scientific conferences and workshops providing trainees experience in research presentation and promoting the Center itself."
"9541529","Project Summary Global pandemic influenza vaccine production capacity is insufficient to meet the expected demand in the event of a highly lethal influenza pandemic. Current H5N1 vaccines require high antigen doses (e.g. 90 ?g) or are combined with squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants for enhanced and broadened immunogenicity as well as antigen dose sparing. Squalene is a naturally occurring oligoisoprene (i.e. a very low molecular weight polymer of isoprene) derived from shark liver, a source with sustainability concerns. Moreover, the biological mechanisms of action of squalene are still not well understood and no systematic comparison of the adjuvant activity of squalene emulsions compared to emulsions based on analog oligoisoprenes has been reported in the literature. This proposal defines a program to develop the sustainable production of various oligoisoprene analogues of squalene using bioengineered organisms and synthetic polymer chemistry. Selected structures will then be formulated in oil-in-water emulsions and evaluated for physicochemical stability. Importantly, we propose to identify structure-activity relationships (SAR) by employing squalene and oligoisoprene analogues in in vitro human and in vivo mouse models in combination with an H5N1 influenza antigen. Moreover, the ability to further enhance adjuvant activity by chemical modification to improve physicochemical properties of selected oligoisoprene structures will be evaluated. The technology generated could be applicable to many other vaccines that have need of emulsion-based adjuvants for antigen dose sparing or enhanced immune responses."
"9431112","Project Summary/Abstract The accurate measurement of the transcriptome is essential for most fields of biomedical research and increasingly in genomic medicine. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a transformative technology that has made measuring the transcriptome more accessible. This has empowered population scale functional genomic analyses, such as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies, which have yielded insight into the regulatory architecture of the genome. However, current RNA-seq methods are invasive and expensive, which has limited the types and numbers of participants involved in research studies, and more broadly the application of RNA-seq in genomic medicine. The objective of this proposal is to develop a novel RNA-seq based method for measuring the transcriptome that is both non-invasive an order of magnitude cheaper than current methods, and apply it to population scale longitudinal and developmental studies of gene expression and cis-regulatory genetic variation. First I will develop a low cost, non-invasive, RNA-seq based method for transcriptome profiling by borrowing from advances in single genomics and identifying easily sampled tissues that capture relevant gene expression. Second, I will use this method in a human longitudinal eQTL study to determine the degree of cis-regulatory genetic variation effect sharing between non-invasively collected tissues and surgically isolated tissues, and to study the effect of environmental variation on the regulatory landscape. Third, I will collect phenotype, genotype, and expression data in a cohort that spans childhood to produce a map of childhood gene expression, characterize interactions between development and cis-regulatory genetic variation, and identify expression biomarkers of common childhood disease. This may reveal the molecular mechanisms of genetic associations to common disease for processes that occur during development, and have thus far been missed in adult eQTL studies. As a whole, this work will further understanding of the dynamic interaction between cis-regulatory genetic variation, the environment, and development, and will produce a new method that will be of wide use to the biomedical community, empowering future transcriptome studies of vulnerable populations and at massive scales."
"9422860","Asthma affects ~23 million individuals in the United States and ~300 million individuals worldwide;1 it has been estimated that 20% of the subjects with asthma contribute 80% of the economic costs of asthma.2 Ready identification of this subset of at-risk subjects would dramatically decrease overall morbidity and costs of this disease. For asthma control, the most widely prescribed medications are inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). We have previously demonstrated that 25-30% of subjects taking ICS for asthma do not respond to therapy,3 thereby classifying them as moderate to severe asthmatics.4 Given that Hispanics Americans are an underserved group and tend to have greater morbidity from asthma in the US,5 this ethnic group is particularly important to study. Micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by mRNA degradation and/or translational repression.6 Many miRNAs have already been associated with asthma7-10 or regulate pathways of immunity and inflammation,11-13 processes central to asthma. We have demonstrated that miRs have associations with asthma exacerbation, response to steroids, and can predict asthma remission14 in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP)15,16 cohort. It is critical to extend these results to other populations, particularly ethnicities with high asthma prevalence and morbidity. This proposal aims to investigate the microRNA underpinnings of asthma exacerbations on and off ICS in a Hispanic population with high incidence of asthma, ICS, and exacerbations: the Genetics of Asthma in Costa Rica study (GACRS) cohort of 1165 childhood asthmatics.17,18 Crucially, GACRS contains many additional omics data available at no cost to the proposal, which provides an excellent opportunity to study microRNA?s interaction with messenger RNA expression and whole-genome sequencing in relation to exacerbation. We will measure asthma control on and off ICS by exacerbations and a steroid responsiveness endophenotype (SRE).19 We hypothesize that miRNAs impacting exacerbation in CAMP will replicate in GACRS, that we may identify further critical miRs, and that predictive models of asthma exacerbations and SRE in the GACRS cohort will replicate in CAMP. Using available serum we will sequence whole blood microRNAs using miR-Seq in GACRS. We will 1) use miRNA-Seq to sequencing miRNAs from serum of 1165 GACRS children, and replicate our associations of miR-206 with ICS response. We then 2) will use whole-genome sequencing data to identify the effects of rare and common variants on miR expression levels and their interaction with exacerbation and ICS response. Finally 3) we will replicate our existing miR model of steroid response in GACRS, and use additionally identified miRs and genomic variants to build stronger predictive models of ICS response and SRE. All of these results will be validated in the CAMP cohort. By completing these objectives, we will have advanced knowledge of ICS treatment response in asthma, while building clinically actionable predictive models of exacerbation and SRE in childhood asthma."
"9530340","Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is rare (~ 1 in every 100,000) but a catastrophic and deadly disease that is often caused by a nonsense mutation (that is, a premature termination codon [PTC]) in the Atm (Ataxia- Telangiectasia mutated) gene. Children born with A-T suffer a progressive loss of motor function and coordination, become wheelchair-bound, and typically die by age 25. No effective treatments are available, in part because no satisfactory animal model exists. Atm-/- mice are not a good model because they do not develop ataxia. However, recognizing that the Atm gene product participates in DNA repair pathways, our collaborator Dr. McKinnon reasoned that inflicting a second hit ? an additional knockout mutation in a second DNA repair gene ? might produce ataxia. To test this notion, he selected to knockout the Aptx (aprataxin) gene because: 1) APTX participates in DNA repair: 2) humans lacking APTX protein develop a disease similar to A-T called AOA (Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia); and 3) like Atm-/- mice, Aptx-/- mice do not develop ataxia. He crossed the single mutant mice to generate a double mutant Atm-/-; Aptx-/- mouse that, as anticipated, exhibits the progressive ataxia observed in A-T and AOA patients. Our LONG TERM GOAL is to utilize these mice to test the safety and effectiveness of potential treatments for A-T and deploy them for clinical use. However, due to the nature of the genetic mutation in these mice (total knockout of the Atm gene), this model is not suitable for testing our recently developed Small Molecule Read-Through (SMRT) compounds, which efficiently read- through the mutation in Atm genes causing the PTCs in A-T (Lee et al., 2013). We have synthesized, purified, and patented a number of derivatives from our original screen that read through all three types of PTCs (TAG, TAA, and TGA) with similar efficiency in Atm and other PTC-containing genes as well as cross the blood brain barrier. To test whether SMRT compounds effectively treat A-T caused by a PTC, we need to create and validate a mouse model of A-T that incorporates a patient-derived PTC and displays ataxia. As a first step, we have created a mutant mouse that expresses a PTC in the Atm gene at the location on exon 15 that it occurs in many patients with A-T. These mice are viable and fertile. Like the Atm knockout, this AtmN/N genotype (?N? for nonsense mutation) is not ataxic. To induce ataxia, we will cross AtmN/N mice with Aptx-/- mice. We predict that like the Atm-/-; Aptx-/- mice, the resultant AtmN/N; Aptx-/- mice will exhibit ataxia and will also contain a PTC amenable to treatment with our SMRT compounds. We propose here to breed, genotype, characterize, and phenotype AtmN/N; Aptx-/- compound mutant mice. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Once the AtmN/N; Aptx-/- mice are fully phenotyped, we will then proceed to perform safety and efficacy studies for our SMRT compounds. This treatment should restore production of ATM protein to sufficient quantities to normalize (or at least alleviate) the symptoms of A-T, including ataxia, immunodeficiency, and high susceptibility to cancer. Our approach could in principle be applied to hundreds of inherited human diseases that are similarly caused by a PTC mutation."
"9444000","Project Summary / Abstract Heart failure is a pressing problem in today?s society. Positive inotropic agents are needed in the treatment of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Many of the currently used drugs (such as ?-adrenergic agonists and phosphodiesterase III inhibitors) are ineffective in the long-term since they are plagued with severe side effects. Calcium sensitizing agents are interesting alternative drug candidates if they can cause a positive inotropic effect without associated side effects. One possible target for calcium sensitizing drugs is cardiac troponin (cTn), a Ca2+-dependent switch, activating and deactivating the myofilament leading to contraction and relaxation. Cardiac cTn consists of three subunits: cTnC, cTnI and cTnT. Increasingly routine computational methods are used to study cTn. However, there remains a critical need for development of novel and more precise tools that expand understanding of molecular processes governing heart contraction in order to guide targeted drug discovery studies. The main objective of this proposal is to develop novel computational methods to predict and modulate calcium sensitization within cTnC. Results from computational method advances will be verified experimentally and the experimental results will drive additional method refinement. The proposed research is structured into three main stages. We will use computer-aided drug design studies to find and experimentally verify novel calcium sensitizing agents (Aim I) and then develop computational models to understand the molecular processes in cTn that underlie the observed sensitizing effect with direct feedback to experiments (Aims II and III). Method development work will focus on overcoming two main hurdles faced by current computational models of cardiomyocyte contraction. Firstly, we will develop new methodology to accurately predict calcium binding affinities to cTnC (Aim II). Based on strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that this requires polarizable force fields, without which Ca2+ binding is not adequately modeled and oversimplified in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Secondly, we will predict the degree to which drugs open up the cTnC-cTnI interface (Aim III). Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that microsecond MD simulations and new methodology are needed to determine the opening degree of the hydrophobic patch in drug-bound conformations. Results from computational method advances will be verified experimentally and the experimental results will drive additional method refinement and improve our initial drug discovery hits."
"9529871","Many bacterial infections, especially those that are resistant to antibiotics, in the young, elderly, and immunocompromised, are characterized by runaway inflammation and sepsis. A hallmark of acute microbial infections is the chemokine-mediated recruitment of neutrophils to the infected tissue. Activated neutrophils release granule enzymes/peptides and superoxide for microbial killing. These processes must be highly regulated, as too many neutrophils will result in collateral tissue damage and disease. Such regulation, under conditions of high bacterial loads and/or when antibiotics are ineffective, is detrimental with infection winning the battle. We propose augmenting the host immune response as a viable strategy for containing bacterial infection. We have discovered that the ability of chemokines to exist as monomers and dimers plays an important role in regulating neutrophil function. We will test the hypothesis that exogenously administered chemokine variants, by promoting neutrophil function, enable successful resolution of inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis. In Aim 1, we will test the therapeutic efficacy of a chemokine dimer by optimizing dosage, timing and frequency of administration after infecting mice with a lethal Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) dose in a septicemic model. In Aim 2, we will determine how successful resolution is restored in chemokine treated mice by characterizing neutrophil and macrophage phenotypes including neutrophil killing activity, and cytokine/chemokine and lipid mediators that serve as benchmarks along the initiation to resolution phase. Our hypothesis, that the host immune response can be skewed for successful resolution of inflammation using engineered chemokines, is novel. Bacterial diseases cause significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden, and are quickly developing antibiotic resistance. Our study will identify the molecular basis of cellular injury and disease exacerbation, enabling discovery and development of more effective therapeutics to treat infectious diseases, especially those that are associated with multi- antibiotic-resistant pathogens."

We will continue our rigor in disseminating our software, experimental and computational protocols via workshops and web seminars. We will maintain an engaging advisory board to critique our progress and guide our strategic planning annually. Our efforts will extend cryo-EM/cryo-ET capabilities to fill the information gaps between x-ray crystallography, NMR and optical microscopy from nanometer to atomic resolutions."
"9405327","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health and health behavior depend crucially on diffusion processes over social networks; both the spread of communicable diseases, such as HIV, and the diffusion of beliefs and practices that shape health behavior, such as dietary risk behavior, can be understood as generalized diffusion over (sometimes very complex and dynamic) social networks. However, despite the clear need, few of our formal analytic tools can be used to model diffusion over any but the simplest of these systems, as the mathematics for modeling diffusion over dynamic multi- relational networks are currently intractable except by direct simulation; which is often a weak foundation for generalizable knowledge; we provide a novel solution to modeling complex diffusion processes over dynamic networks by decomposing the networks into a set of tractable subsets and relation specific transmission rules. We will develop improved methods for network community detection that specifically targets understanding diffusion, and include such communities in our general framework; then test these new models against a bank of constructed and real social networks to assess model performance. Using simulation, novel new network clustering techniques and extensions of formal diffusion models, this project will develop the tools necessary to interpolate between the simplest direct diffusion cases and the most complex social behavior cases; advances will provide fundamental insights into health- relevant diffusion, yielding more robust modeling and highlighting directions for possible intervention."
"9405843","Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PCA) remains a fatal disease with extremely poor prognosis, despite advances in the understanding of molecular mechanisms in cancer biology. This may be attributed to the failure in translating the acquired knowledge into viable therapeutics. Towards this end, we have defined a novel regulatory role for the protein GIPC in pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis, and identified it as a plausible target for pancreatic cancer therapy. GIPC binds to various endogenous proteins with its PDZ domain. Our published results suggest that either depletion of GIPC expression, or disruption of PDZ domain- binding between GIPC and endogenous partner proteins (such as IGF-1R or endoglin) via peptide-based inhibitors, elicits a significant inhibitory response in pancreatic cancer growth. We have also shown that pancreatic cancer cells with depleted GIPC expression exhibited an increase in autophagy and exosome biogenesis, and enhanced sensitivity towards the conventional drug gemcitabine. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate that GIPC binding partners and downstream signaling molecules are differentially regulated in different subgroups of PCA. Taken together, these observations have led us to hypothesize that inactivation of GIPC function, by disrupting the binding of GIPC with subgroup-specific endogenous partner proteins, can be exploited to inhibit signaling pathways important for cancer progression, metastasis and drug resistance in various subgroups of PCA. This would have important clinical implications towards the development of personalized therapy for treating pancreatic cancer. To test our hypothesis, we have proposed two aims. Aim 1 will focus on developing a new generation of highly selective and potent peptide and small molecule inhibitors of GIPC, with the help of NMR spectrometry and X-ray crystallography, the latter which has recently yield the first structure of GIPC bound to one of our inhibitors. Aim 2 will focus on determining how GIPC and its partner proteins differentially regulate various downstream signaling pathways in different subgroups of PCA, and designing new individualized therapy for pancreatic cancer based on the this acquired knowledge. Overall, these studies will help us to develop novel personalized therapeutic strategies for different subgroups of PCA, by combining conventional drugs with newly-developed pathway- specific inhibitors of GIPC, which can be translated to fast track clinical trials in the near future."
"9418153","PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis affects millions of Americans annually and is a leading cause for intensive care utilization. Currently no therapies exist to target the abnormal host response that is widely acknowledged to contribute to multi-organ dysfunction and death from severe infection. The applicant has received continuous R01 support from the NHLBI since 2007-2008 to research the host vascular response in sepsis. Our group has identified the Tie2 receptor and its ligands, the Angiopoietins, as an important switch in the endothelium that may govern essential elements of the vascular response to sepsis. We have proposed that Angiopoietin-2, an antagonist of Tie2 that is induced during sepsis, potentiates vascular leakage and thereby contributes to acute respiratory distress arising from sepsis and related conditions. Since Angiopoietin-2 can be measured peripherally, we have also proposed that its circulating concentration may predict the risk of adverse outcomes from sepsis and may enable clinicians to track the host vascular response in a quantitative and operator-independent fashion. Finally, we have recently found evidence that polymorphisms at the TIE2 locus itself may inform the level of gene expression, and in turn, how well or poorly an individual's blood vessels respond to the stress of sepsis. This body of work to which we and many others have now contributed suggests that we are on the cusp of developing breakthrough personalized medicine approaches based on the host vascular response in sepsis. Such advances could revolutionize the care delivered in our ICUs. This application seeks to develop the core hypothesis that the Tie2 axis may be a crucial determinant of the host vascular response in sepsis through the following three themes: (1) create humanized mouse models of the Tie2 axis using cutting-edge genome engineering to model the human host vascular response, and its genetic determinants, in a physiological context; (2) identify major mechanisms by which Tie2 and the endothelium regulate hemostasis in sepsis; and (3) study the crosstalk between the microcirculation and metabolically active organs to understand how the host vascular response and dysmetabolism collaborate to drive multi-organ dysfunction. The outstanding qualifications of our team in the Tie2 field, genetic epidemiology, thrombosis research, and metabolism uniquely position us to deliver an unprecedented and integrated molecular view of sepsis from the perspective of blood vessels that is not only highly responsive to the challenges in sepsis research identified by global leaders, but could fundamentally alter paradigms of patient care in the ICU."
"9405018","The BioCAT Biotechnology Research Resource operates X-ray beamline 18ID at the Advanced Photon  Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Now in its 20th year of operation, it is a mature, productive facility with  many capabilities unique in the USA, and, arguably, the world. Going forward, we intend to maintain our world-  class capabilities in static, time- and spatially-resolved fiber diffraction with beamline enhancements for  increased flux and beam quality. A novel high speed, high sensitivity, high spatial resolution pixel array  detector will provide an excellent match to the needs of our muscle diffraction program. Also proposed is a  versatile micro-diffraction/micro-SAXS instrument that can use one of two Compound Refractive Lenses  optimized for either wide- or small-angle fiber crystallography, and continuous flow SAXS experiments. We will  implement multimodal scanning micro-diffraction, x-ray florescence microscopy, phase contrast and uv/visible  imaging that can be done either singly or in combination with the same instrument on the same samples.  Developments in time-resolved SAXS will extend available time regimes from 500 ns to seconds with major  reductions in sample consumption, by more than order of magnitude, from current capabilities. This will allow  a much wider range of biomedical problems to be addressed than previously possible. A new beamline data  acquisition and control system will provide a common interface and better data management for all  experiments and advanced support for time resolved experiments. Combined refractive index, dynamic light  scattering and multi-angle light scattering measurements with SAXS will offer more comprehensive sample  characterization on-line for more robust results. A multi-scale modeling effort will allow extracting more  information from muscle X-ray diffraction studies. The proposed developments in multi-scale simulations for  interpreting single molecule SAXS data will profoundly benefit studies of multicomponent systems that show  considerable conformational heterogeneity. Our relationship with the CCP-SAS project will enable us to widely  disseminate the advanced modeling tools we create to not only all our DBP's, collaborative and service users  but to the wider biomedical community. Our Driving Biomedical Projects, collaborative, and service projects  have relevance to basic mechanisms of muscle function, heart disease, retinitis pigmentosa, cancer and  neuro-degenerative diseases. Our proposed training activities are designed to ensure safe, efficient and  productive use of the resource by our users. Our proposed dissemination activities are designed to grow our  user community by keeping targeted biomedical communities well-informed of resource capabilities."
"9472173","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza A virus (IAV) is an upper respiratory pathogen in humans that causes seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. Well known for its promiscuous host species tropism, IAV can infect waterfowl, domestic birds, swine, humans, and sea mammals. IAV strains endemic to waterfowl and domestic animals are capable of spontaneously crossing the species barrier, leading to outbreaks in other host species and even pandemics in humans. The ability of IAV to rapidly adapt to new environments is in part due to the inherent low fidelity of the encoded RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP); however, little is known as to how host RNA editing enzymes contribute to IAV evolution. We have recently identified ADAR1 as a host factor that is essential for optimal IAV replication and maintenance of viral population fitness during antiviral drug selection (oseltamivir). This proposal aims to determine how ADAR1 editing of the viral genome increases genetic diversity, drives evolution, promotes fitness, and contributes to species adaptation and tissue tropism. The knowledge gained from this research will allow us to (1) surveil for specific genetic polymorphisms in avian reservoirs that can potentially cross the species barrier, (2) identify genetic variants in seasonal strains that can render drug resistance, (3) understand how positive selection of host adaptive mutations arise during natural evolution, (4) determine how host factors influence viral species tropism, (5) further investigate the role of other editing enzymes n RNA virus evolution, and (6) develop host-targeted therapeutics to inhibit virus replication and adaptation."
"9405604","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S., nearly 500,000 patients suffer an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) each year. Most emergency departments (EDs) lack the local capabilities to perform primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for myocardial reperfusion. Thus, patients must be transferred to capable facilities, but inefficiencies in this process cause delays in timely myocardial reperfusion and worsen patient outcomes. The time to reperfusion for transferred STEMI patients greatly lags behind those patients who present directly to PCI centers and fails to meet national benchmark standards in 90% of cases. Inadequate measurement and understanding of the timing and processes of care at transferring EDs has hindered improvement in the timeliness of STEMI patient transfer. Moreover, the study of relational coordination, communication, and organizational design, collectively known as organizational behavior, is an accepted approach to study performance and variation in complex health systems. It has not yet been applied to the transfer of STEMI patients, but would likely reveal important targets for intervention. This proposal describes a career development plan that enables the candidate to gain expertise in how organizational behavior affects patient care, through the acquisition of advanced qualitative and quantitative skills for future implementation studies. The Specific Aims are: 1) Examine transferring ED data for factors associated with delays to myocardial reperfusion; 2) Conduct a detailed qualitative study of the practices that affect patient transfer for primary PCI; and 3) Examine the association between relational coordination and time spent at transferring EDs. The candidate is uniquely qualified as an emergency physician and PhD candidate in operations management. The career development plan builds on this foundation to provide: a) advanced skills in qualitative methods (e.g., patient and staff interviewing skills, and observation), biostatistics, and organizational theory; b) further development of scientific communication skills through manuscript preparation, grant writing, and conference presentations; and c) a multidisciplinary mentored research experience with international experts in transitions of care, qualitative research, process intervention development, and trial design. The institutional environment is outstanding, including a qualitative research center; nationally ranked graduate programs in the candidate's fields of study; and the national CTSA coordinating center. This career development award will allow the candidate to develop expertise in measuring the performance of healthcare systems during inter-facility patient transfer, a deep understanding of the relationship between system performance and patient outcomes, and targets for intervention to improve the timeliness of patient care for myocardial infarction. This award will position the candidate to become an R01-funded independent investigator who implements and evaluates process interventions to improve patient outcomes."
"9395127","Project Summary  Sperm-egg compatibility is essential to the evolutionary success of any sexually reproducing organism, yet reproductive proteins are often some of the most rapidly evolving genes in any taxa. In threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus), reproductive isolation is present in many recently derived populations throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but the precise biochemical mechanisms driving this isolation are unknown. Stickleback are classic examples of molecular adaptation and speciation, but reproductive proteins are probable candidates as yet unexplored in this model evolutionary system. We hypothesize that reproductive proteins secreted by stickleback egg and sperm will display signatures of rapid Darwinian evolution, and their divergence may be involved in reproductive isolation and speciation. In Aim 1, we will identify stickleback sperm-egg recognition proteins using tandem mass spectrometry. In Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of population-level genomic differences between stickleback species pairs to reproductive isolation. The proposed research is innovative in that prior to our work, the consensus in the field has been that behavioral explanations underlie observed stickleback reproductive isolation; however, our work has found evidence for rapidly evolving stickleback egg proteins, indicating sperm competition and potentially other forms of pre-zygotic mating isolation are present in sticklebacks, challenging the current consensus in the field."
"9445963","PROJECT SUMMARY: Mammalian aging is associated with reduced tissue regeneration due to declining function of tissue-specific stem cells. In the blood system, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging is accompanied by an expansion of myeloid-biased HSCs with reduced self-renewal functions. Aging of HSCs and their niches likely contributes to aged-related hematologic malignancies such a myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myelogenous leukemia. Whether the aging microenvironment drives the phenotypic features of aging HSCs, however, remains unclear. In the healthy bone marrow of young mice, our prior studies show that niches cells containing mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) activity, marked by Nestin expression, are innervated and regulated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Preliminary data supporting this grant application have revealed marked alterations in the vasculature of aged bone marrow, associated with loss of SNS innervation, and increased Nestin+ cell numbers. In addition, we find that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in endothelial and perivascular cells oscillates in a circadian manner, and that these oscillations are impaired in aged bone marrow. Aged bone marrow endothelial cells also exhibit significant alterations in glucose metabolism, that are regulated by SNS-derived signals. Based on these preliminary data, we propose to explore the hypothesis that the loss of SNS nerve signals contributes to the hematopoietic aging phenotype via regulation of the vascular- associated niche cells. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims wherein: Specific Aim 1 will investigate the function of ?-adrenergic signals in the aging HSC niche using pharmacological and genetic approaches to modulate the sympathetic tone. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate how SNS-enabled circadian rhythms and ROS homeostasis alter MSCs and niche function to regulate niche structure and HSC aging phenotypes. Specific Aim 3 will investigate the role of SNS innervation in age-related alterations of vascular metabolism in the HSC niche. The proposed studies will shed new light on the contributions of the aging niche on HSC function, and will help to devise new therapeutic strategies to prevent or improve the course of age-associated hematopoietic diseases.#"
"9408619","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in one of the two genes that encode type I collagen (COL1AI or COL1A2), is the most common hereditary bone disease. OI is characterized by mild to severe reduction in the quantity of bone matrix that leads to repeated fractures and bone deformity. In the United States, the incidence of OI is estimated to be 1 per 20,000 live births. A present there is no cure for OI. Treatment is aimed at increasing overall bone strength to prevent fracture. Long-term treatment with the drugs has its own side effects; therefore several strategies are being tested experimentally in OI to enhance bone remodeling, one of them being the use of stem cells. We have shown that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation can ameliorate the bone defects seen in oim mice. We also demonstrated that HSCs gives rise to osteoblasts and osteocytes during normal bone turnover as well as non- stabilized fracture repair. Our preliminary data from oim mice transplanted with a clonal population derived from a single enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP+) HSC demonstrates a significant improvement in the trabecular and the cortical parameters in engrafted mice. We also show that HSC transplantation leads to the formation of functional osteoblasts that deposited collagen and formed bone in vivo. These studies and our data suggest that osteoblasts can be derived from a novel source, i.e. HSCs. Thus, this proposal is to test the hypothesis that HSCs can give rise to osteoblasts in OI and understanding the molecular factors that promote its mobilization as well as osteogenesis could have therapeutic value in OI. Aim 1 is to establish that HSCs can give rise to osteoblasts employing transplantation studies with HSCs derived from mice having visual markers under the control of a bone directed collagen type I promoter, which allows for specific identification of cells at various stages of osteoblast lineage. Utilizing the mice expressing GFP in the hematopoietic cells and Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) in the non-hematopoietic tissues we will do lineage tracing from the HSCs. The goals of Aim 2 are to characterize the factors modifying bone reconstitution by HSCs in OI and define the molecular mechanisms regulating HSC differentiation to osteoblasts. Effect of factors on mobilization of HSCs and their differentiation to osteoblasts will be studied both in vitro and in vivo. Findings from this study ill be significant in that they can be applied to long-term studies to enhance and accelerate bone healing in OI. This will open many new avenues of therapy for a number of bone diseases and injuries through the use and modulation of HSCs."
"9624159","SUMMARY  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia of clinical significance, and it often results in devastating outcomes. Because current treatment is frequently ineffective, there is a critical need for an improved understanding of the mechanisms causing AF and novel strategies to treat it. Abundant evidence has linked oxidative stress to the pathogenesis and progression of AF, yet upstream therapy to target these processes has been ineffective. Lipid aldehydes are a major component of oxidative stress-related injury, and the most reactive products generated, isolevuglandins (IsoLGs), react almost instantaneously with proteins to cause dysfunction. Dicarbonyl scavengers have been developed that preemptively bind IsoLGs before they can interact with biologic targets. Using these tools, IsoLGs were recently identified as critical mediators in angiotensin II-mediated hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. Diseases of oxidative stress are also linked to proteotoxicity, or cellular dysfunction caused by misfolded proteins. In amyloid diseases like Alzheimer's, preamyloid oligomers (PAOs) are now recognized to be the primary cytotoxic species that correlates with disease progression. Notably, IsoLGs markedly accelerate PAO formation for amyloidogenic proteins. Based on our preliminary data, the goal of this proposal is to test the hypotheses that both IsoLGs and PAOs are biologically-relevant mediators that promote AF susceptibility, making them potential therapeutic targets.  We have acquired compelling preliminary data to support the concept that IsoLGs and PAOs are drivers of the AF substrate: PAOs are commonly detected in human atrium, with the fibrillogenic protein atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) a major component, and they associate with hypertension; IsoLGs and PAOs are formed in cellular and in vivo models associated with AF susceptibility, including rapidly-stimulated atrial cells, hypertension, obesity, and familial AF; and there is a beneficial effect of scavenging IsoLGs to reduce atrial PAO and AF burden. Moreover, a mutant form of ANP linked to familial AF markedly enhances the formation of cytotoxic ANP oligomers, and these PAOs accumulate in the atria of mice modeling the human disease. The first Aim will test the hypothesis that in hypertension and obesity, oxidative stress-mediated IsoLGs promote atrial cell injury and AF susceptibility. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that mutant ANP oligomers alter atrial myocyte homeostasis to generate AF susceptibility, and they promote oxidative stress/IsoLG formation that can feed-forward to perpetuate the pathologic process. Finally, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that in addition to hypertension, other AF risk factors linked to oxidative stress are also associated with accumulation of IsoLGs and/or cytotoxic PAOs, supporting their role in human disease. The proposed studies have major significance, given that IsoLG and PAOs may provide not only common mechanistic links between oxidative stress, proteotoxicity, common clinical risk factors, and AF, but also novel therapeutic targets in the prevention and/or treatment of this common arrhythmia."
"9427850","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While immunotherapy has transformed treatment for numerous malignancies, this impact has not yet been fully realized in prostate cancer (PCa), one of the most common cancers. Based on Phase 1 results, PCa is currently felt to be unresponsive to checkpoint inhibition with anti-PD-1 monotherapy. However, emerging data indicates that 10-30% of metastatic PCa can respond to anti-PD-1. Given previous studies suggesting that cancers with microsatellite instability respond well to anti-PD-1, it is notable that defects in mismatch repair or other DNA repair pathways involve ~20% of PCa and could modulate anti-PD-1 response by increasing neoantigen production. Together, these findings pose several challenges: proving that specific DNA damage repair defects (DRDs) are linked to PD-1 responses in PCa, and inciting responses in PD-1-nonresponsive PCa, particularly those that lack the genetic signatures associated with response. Our hypothesis is that most PCa patients lack sufficient pre-existing anti-tumor immune responses that can be amplified by anti-PD-1 to mediate clinical responses. We propose that response rates can be increased by selecting patients with specific DRDs, or by combining PD-1 blockade with chemotherapy. We are initiating a phase 2 study in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) evaluating the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment. Importantly, we will select patients that either possess or lack DNA repair defects that have recently been described in CRPC. We hypothesize that patients with these defects will not only have a higher mutational burden leading to increased neoantigen production, but will also lead to activation of innate DNA- sensing immune pathways, both of which will lead to an immuno-stimulatory milieu. Tumor and blood samples derived from this clinical trial will be used to test these hypotheses. In Aim 1, we will determine the tumor- intrinsic molecular determinants of response with a focus on MSI status, presence of DRDs including defined somatic or germline alterations, neoantigen burden, and expression signatures associated with DRD. Instead of being driven solely by neoantigen burden, we anticipate that responses will be associated with specific DRDs that correlate with graded levels of immune activation, which can be corroborated by our assessment of immune activation in paired samples. In Aim 2, we will test whether tumors with these DRDs possess increased intratumoral immune infiltration and PD-L1 expression, as well as heightened circulating immunity before or during treatment. This enhanced immune activation will also be reflected in a higher frequency of tumor-reactive T cells that we can track with T cell receptor sequencing of both blood and tumor. In Aim 3, we will examine whether anti-PD-1 treatment induces immuno-selective pressure that can lead to clonal evolution in the tumor. Collectively this work will not only advance our understanding of what makes a tumor responsive to immune checkpoint blockade, but also accelerate the development of biomarkers predictive of response and will provide the rationale for clinically relevant treatment combination therapies to benefit patients with CRPC."
"9455011","Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal ?FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation? is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three specific influenza virus strains with different levels of pathogenicity. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and in early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent promising targets for therapeutic intervention. We also propose that, in addition to the pathways identified in our previous collaboration, there are additional distinct pathways that result in either resilience or pathogenic outcomes after influenza virus infection, and that specific pathogenic pathways will require tailored therapeutic interventions. To identify networks associated with clinical disease in humans, we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models OMICS responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1, Aim 3); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1, Aim 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells experimentally infected under controlled conditions and perturbations associated with diverse disease outcomes (Project 2). Samples will be collected, processed and send to the Technology Core to conduct global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for mechanistic studies and therapeutic intervention (Project 1, Aim 2). In summary, our systems modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies."
"9399643","?     DESCRIPTION, OVERALL (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CSIBD) is to promote and facilitate research that will yield insight into the causes and pathogenesis of IBD and lead to improved therapeutic approaches. This overarching objective remains unchanged since the inception of the CSIBD in 1991 and has guided the Center through substantial growth and expansion. The research base is made up of 111 scientists with $48.7 million in digestive disease-related research support. Organizing these investigators by areas of focus, we divide the CSIBD into six central themes. Our goal of understanding human IBD is accomplished using six entry points: (1) genetics, (2) microbial interactions, (3) barrier function and epithelial cell biology, (4) innate and adaptive immunity, (5) therapeutics, and (6) systems biology and signal transduction. Clinicians, scientists, and engineers are embedded in each theme. A central priority of the CSIBD is to bring together researchers from these various approaches and to provide an intellectual nexus for these individuals to find common interests in understanding and treating IBD. This is accomplished through several routes. First, the five biomedical cores offer state-of-the-art resources and expertise from leaders in (1) Human Genetics and Microbiome, (2) Immunology, (3) Morphology, and (4) Genetic Animal Models. In addition to offering guidance and access to technologies, core directors serve as connection points between investigators, facilitating collaborations. Similarly, the (5) Clinical Core aids the community through access to thousands of patient samples while serving as a hub for interactions between clinicians and basic researchers. Operating independently of these cores, the close relationship between the CSIBD and the Broad Institute allows further access to cutting-edge technologies. The overall specific aims of the CSIBD are to (1) promote research in basic science areas relevant to better understanding of mucosal immune function and epithelial biology in IBD; (2) advance our understanding of gut pathophysiology by examining the gut as a circuit: studying the core components of gut intra- and inter-cellular interactions that determine health and disease; (3) promote the study of the pathogenesis of IBD; (4) promote interactions among scientists exploring diverse fields that share relevance to IBD; (5) promote translational IBD research; (6) attract basic investigators to the study of IBD and mucosal immunology; and (7) provide an environment and mechanism to foster development of young investigators focused on IBD. A comprehensive Enrichment Program introduces new members to the IBD community and encourages face-to-face interactions between investigators from a range of fields. Attracting new members to the CSIBD and IBD research is also greatly facilitated through Pilot and Feasibility Program support, the success of which is reflected by 79% of recipients achieving external funding."
"9411136","Stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death throughout the world, and the leading cause of long-term disability. Ischemic stroke, the most common subtype, is caused by occlusion of an artery in the brain, resulting in the abrupt development of neurological deficits. In the first hours after stroke onset, neurological deficits can be highly unstable, with many patients improving while others deteriorate. These early changes have a major impact on long-term outcome. In fact, changes in neurologic deficits during the first 24 hours account for 40% of the variance of the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (the most widely accepted stroke outcome measure) in patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). In my preliminary analyses, it was discovered that baseline clinical factors account for very little of the variation seen in neurologic deficits during the first 24 hours while genetic factors appear to account for over 50%. Given the finding that genetics influence the variance of early neurologic changes, it is my central hypothesis that genetics play a significant role in determining the early outcomes experienced by patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke (AIS).  As a fellowship-trained emergency physician subspecializing in neurologic emergencies, my long term goal is to develop an independent research program to investigate genetic influences on acute neurological emergencies to improve patient outcomes. In order to achieve this goal, I have developed two short term goals that will be achieved during the award period: 1) to become technically proficient in genetic/genomic analysis and research methodology and 2) to develop greater familiarity with cellular and molecular mechanisms involved with brain and neurovascular injury following AIS. In order to achieve these goals, I have crafted a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors and collaborators. Over the past several years, I have been working closely with my primary mentor, Dr. Jin-Moo Lee (Director of the Cerebrovascular Disease and Neurointensive Care Sections in Neurology) and my secondary mentor Dr. Carlos Cruchaga (a human geneticist with expertise in complex genetic analyses), to examine possible genetic influences on the early neurologic outcomes after acute ischemic stroke. They both have a strong track record of mentoring junior investigators and bring complimentary backgrounds and expertise to my mentoring and career development.  Under the guidance of Drs. Jin-Moo Lee and Carlos Cruchaga, I will engage in structured coursework, advanced training and independent study to become proficient in patient-oriented research, genetic analysis, and research methodology. To capture early neurological change following AIS, we have developed a novel quantitative endophenotype, termed ?NIHSS24h, which is a measure of the change in NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) score between baseline (<6 hours after onset) and 24 hours. Using a cohort of AIS patients treated with IV tPA that will consist of 3,000 phenotyped subjects drawn from an international multicenter consortium and representing the largest such dataset of early stroke outcomes linked to genetics in the world, I will explore the following: Aim 1: To perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS), examining early neurological change (?NIHSS24h) after AIS. Using the first 3,000 tPA-treated AIS patients (Discovery cohort, estimated accrual September, 2016), GWAS of common & rare coding variants will be performed to discover single variants, genes, and pathways associated with ?NIHSS24h. An additional 3,000 tPA-treated patients (Replication Cohort) will be accrued by September 2019, and used to replicate findings from the initial Discovery cohort. Aim 2: To use extreme phenotype sampling with low frequency functional variants of large effect size for early neurological deterioration (Aim 2a) or improvement (Aim 2b) after AIS. We will select patients with the most extremes of ?NIHSS24h, representing those with greatest deterioration or improvement, and compare to matched controls with little change in ?NIHSS24h. Replication of the top hits in each extreme will be performed in the overall cohort with gene-based sequencing and analysis. Of those patients who deteriorate, we will determine which genetic variants associate with hemorrhagic transformation and which do not.  This research plan reflects my multidisciplinary training and career development in emergency medicine, neurologic emergencies, and genetics. It is a long-term objective that the unbiased approach presented in this research proposal will reveal important variants, genes and pathways involved in acute brain ischemia, possibly leading to both diagnostic and therapeutic targets to improve outcomes following stroke."
"9509280","Abstract The Ig? locus produces a wide array of Ig? rearrangements, but how this complex process is regulated is not well understood. The creation of a diverse Ig? repertoire is facilitated by major changes in the 3D structure of the Ig? locus called locus contraction, and this is thought to allow V? genes throughout the locus a chance to come into proximity with the J? genes to which one V? gene will rearrange in each pre-B cell. However, the factors that are important in initiating and orchestrating the changes in the 3D structure and establishing long- range loops within the Ig? locus in pre-B cells are not known. Importantly, how the 3D structure affects V? gene utilization is not known. Hi-C and 4C studies indicate that there are some regions within the V? portion of the locus that are preferential hubs of long-range interactions with iE?, which is located just 2 kb downstream of the J? genes. We found that the most predominant of these interaction hubs within the V? locus demonstrate binding of multiple transcription factors (TF), and they also have broad regions with the epigenetic marks of enhancers, a few even at the pro-B cell stage. Unlike the known Ig? enhancers at the 3' end of the Ig? locus, these novel enhancer-like regions are in the middle and distal parts of the V? locus. No enhancers have been characterized within the large V region portions of any antigen receptor loci, so this is completely novel. We hypothesized that these enhancer elements would be important in orchestrating the 3D configuration of the contracted Ig? locus, and also that the 3D configuration will affect the composition of the Ig? repertoire. Deletion of the most prominent enhancer, which we term E88, in an inducible Abl cell line and in mice showed reduced rearrangement of most V? genes assayed throughout the locus, particularly those in in a broad range surrounding E88, and especially at earlier times after induction of rearrangement. By 4C, we have shown altered long-range interactions in E88-deleted cells. In order to gain insight into the mechanism by which E88 exerts it effect on V gene rearrangement frequency, we will move E88 to a region far from its natural position in the V? locus in both E88-deleted cells and wild type Abl cells. We will determine if the relocated E88 now becomes a hub of interactions like E88 in its proper location, and if the normal E88 will compete with the relocated E88 for long-range interactions. Importantly, we will determine the effects of this ectopic E88 on local and locus-wide individual V? gene rearrangement frequencies. This will provide novel data regarding the relationship of the 3D structure of the Ig? locus with individual V gene usage, which is not know for any of the Ig loci. If ectopic E88 does result in increased rearrangement to nearby genes, it is possible that such manipulations might be of therapeutic use in mice bearing human Ig loci to increase rearrangement of desired V? genes. !"
"9431170","ABSTRACT COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States and has major public health impacts. Current treatments can improve symptoms but none prevent disease progression or reduce mortality. This is in part due to the high burden of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, which complicate diagnosis and treatment. COPD-associated cardiovascular disease has not been adequately studied but may provide avenues to improve clinical outcomes. There are currently no proven therapies for COPD-related pulmonary vascular disease despite numerous trials testing vasodilators in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. Conduct of these studies has been hampered by the lack of a non-invasive measure of pulmonary pressure and no tools adequately detect early pulmonary vascular abnormalities. We have developed a novel, non- invasive, cardiac MRI measure of pulmonary artery impedance (the velocity transfer function) that may prove useful in the identification and quantification of COPD-associated pulmonary vascular disease. Specific Aim 1 of this proposal is to determine whether the velocity transfer function can identify abnormalities in pulmonary arterial impedance in COPD and whether it correlates with right ventricular function. It is also well established that beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease, but COPD patients are often denied these medications because of concerns about adverse effects of beta-blockade on airway function. Multiple observational studies now indicate that beta-blockers may in fact reduce exacerbation risk in COPD and the multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, Beta-Blocker for the Prevention of COPD Exacerbations (BLOCK- COPD) trial is underway to test this hypothesis. Regardless of the results, questions will remain about the risk- benefit of beta-blockers in patients with COPD, including their effects on exercise. Specific Aim 2 of this proposal is to determine the effect of metoprolol on peak exercise as assessed by cycle ergometry in patients with COPD. This proposal also aims to provide mentoring and training opportunities to new investigators pursuing COPD Patient-Oriented Research (POR). Mentoring will be tailored to meet the interests and objectives of individual trainees but a core set of topics will be presented through one-on-one and group sessions. Specialized training in biostatistics as well as research applications of quantitative thoracic CT and cardiac MRI will also be provided. Trainees will also take advantage of career development programs offered by the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science. The proposal also aims to provide the PI with formal mentoring training as well as research training in comparative effectiveness and health services methodology which will open new avenues for his own investigative career as well as additional opportunities for trainees. The K24 will contribute significantly to the PI's long term career objectives to 1) extend our understanding of cardiopulmonary interactions in COPD; 2) conduct high impact POR to transform care for patients with the disease; and 3) help train the next generation of investigators planning careers in COPD POR."
"9319390","Since its inception the Yeast Resource Center has specialized in extracting information about protein function from genome sequence. We began when the first eukaryotic genome was completed (budding yeast) and developed an array of technologies to decipher protein function from genome sequence. In this application, we make the natural progression towards understanding how protein variation affects protein levels, modification, function and structure. We propose to develop technologies in four areas: 1) To identify different protein variants or isoforms. 2) To quantify proteins by mass spectrometry with a focus on determining absolute levels of a protein. 3) To study how protein variation affects protein function. 4) To determine the structures of protein complexes not amenable to high-resolution methods such as x-ray crystallography and NMR."
"9395922","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Down Syndrome (DS) is the most common known genetic origin of intellectual disability and has an estimated incidence of 1 in every 1000 live births. Such children face unique challenges as they enter into the school years, because the speech that was previously adequate for communication with familiar partners in supportive settings is often not sufficient for academic communication with unfamiliar partners. Indeed, 95% of parents surveyed reported that their children with DS had difficulty being understood by persons outside their immediate social circle (Kumin, 1994). This has significant implications for academic, social, and vocational success; children with limited language skills are at risk of falling behind nondisabled peers academically and experiencing social isolation. Secondary issues often arise when children experience frustration in communication, commonly in the form of challenging behaviors. All aspects of development are further compromised when these behaviors involve aggression toward others, have significant health implications when they are self-injurious, and exacerbate service costs when they necessitate extensive behavior management plans.  Children with DS are in desperate need of communication interventions that provide them with the tools to succeed throughout the school years. One form of intervention is called aided augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). In typical clinical applications, aided AAC systems employ picture books, tablet-style computers that present the user with graphic symbols, and sometimes text or synthesized voice output. Because AAC relies on vision rather than sound/speech for access to the communication messages, it is critical to map out how children with DS examine and extract information from visual AAC displays. Otherwise there is the risk of implementing systems that are poorly matched to children's skills and needs, a practice that in turn results in limited use or abandonment of the system.  Few current AAC designs consider the fit between the system and the visual processing skills of users, and most are uninformed by empirical knowledge about human visual information processing. Moreover, little is known about visual processing in persons with significant communication limitations associated with DS. This research aims to improve the design of AAC displays through characterization of visual attention patterns to different AAC displays and their effects on functional use. Eye tracking - rarely used in DS - will reveal attention patterns/processes that typically go unrecorded in behavioral research. Our three-phase program will begin with eye tracking studies of visual attention under largely non-social laboratory conditions. In the next phase, we will introduce social interactions and record gaze path using mobile eye tracking technology. In the final phase, we will translate the knowledge gained in the laboratory studies to optimize functional communication in individuals with DS in performing tasks that represent typical daily life activities."
"9535557","Project Summary Lymphocyte migration and recirculation has long been thought to play a critical role in homeostatic lymphocyte survival. This is certainly the case for T cells where migration within the T cell zone and interactions with fibroblastic reticular cells enables access to interleukin-7, a cytokine that together with tonic signals from the T cell receptor promotes long-term T cell maintenance. Similarly, B cell homeostasis is controlled by a combination of tonic signaling from the B cell receptor (BCR) and B cell Activating Factor (BAFF) receptor. However, neither tonic BCR signaling nor BAFF receptor signaling are anatomically restricted (e.g. secondary lymphoid organs). Therefore, the generalized notion that B cell survival is linked to their intrinsic ability to migrate within and between lymphoid organs is not easily compatible with the current knowledge of B lymphocyte homeostasis. In recent and preliminary studies we tested the impact of G alpha inhibitory (Gi) protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor signaling in B cell homeostasis by examining the B cell compartment of mice in which Pertussis toxin (PTX) expression is enforced in B cells. In this grant we provide evidence showing that PTX+ B cells have severe defects in transitional B cell differentiation into mature B cells in the spleen, and defects in mature B cell survival. Furthermore, we show that BCR signaling is significantly increased in PTX+ B cells, which results in a dramatic increase in DNASE1L3 expression and nuclear localization. PTX+ B cells have increased DNA damage, and we hypothesize that the BCR-dependent increase in DNASE1L3 contributes to the defects seen in transitional B cell differentiation and mature B cell homeostasis. In this grant we propose to examine the mechanism(s) whereby Gi protein signaling attenuates tonic BCR signaling, and to measure the impact of DNASE1L3 in removal of aberrant cells from the B cell compartment. In specific aim 1 we will test whether reducing BCR signaling from PTX+ B cells rescues the B cell differentiation and survival defects. We will further characterize protein-protein interactions established by GTP-Gi proteins by mass spectrometry analyses of proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Gi in PTX+ and PTX- B cells. In specific aim 2 we will test the impact of Dnase1l3 genetic deficiency in PTX+ B cell transitional differentiation and mature B cell survival. We will also quantify the extent to which DNASE1L3 causes DNA damage in PTX+ B cells. Combined, these studies will not only provide new insights into the fundamentals of B cell differentiation and homeostatic survival, but may also provide insight into new molecular targets for manipulating B cells in vivo for the treatment of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency, and B cell malignancies."
"9449007","Summary Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating neuropsychological disorder that develops as a result of exposure to physical or psychological trauma. Emerging evidence suggests that PTSD is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent clinical studies suggest that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)?crucial to blood pressure control and fluid homeostasis?reduces the severity of PTSD symptoms. We have also demonstrated in a preclinical mouse model of PTSD (Pavlovian fear conditioning) that angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) inhibition attenuates conditioned fear responses and facilitates the extinction of conditioned fear. Both AT1Rs and angiotensin type 2 receptors (AT2Rs) are expressed in the amygdala, a brain region critical for fear learning and extinction. Whether different brains AT receptor subtypes play a role in stress disorders such as PTSD is largely unknown, as is their impact on cardiovascular dysfunction in fear. Our preliminary studies suggest, however, that activation and inhibition of brain AT2Rs have opposing effects on the expression of fear memory in a preclinical mouse model of PTSD. Utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach that combines physiological, molecular, analytical and behavioral neuroscience, this proposal will investigate the role of endogenous brain angiotensin II, its receptors (AT1R and AT2R) and downstream signaling pathways in fear memory and cardiovascular events associated with conditioned fear. Our working hypothesis is that the expression and activity of brain angiotensin II and its receptors (AT1R / AT2R) are differentially and dynamically regulated during the consolidation and recall of fear memory, and that these changes contribute to the balance of excitatory (?fear-on?) and inhibitory (?fear-off?) signals required for the storage and retrieval of conditioned fear memories. The goals of this proposal are two-fold: (1) Identify signaling pathways and gene networks that are both regulated by brain AT1R/AT2R activation and implicated in the excitatory and inhibitory signaling necessary and sufficient for fear learning and retrieval; (2) Determine the spatio-temporal contributions of AT1Rs and AT2Rs in key limbic and hypothalamic structures on the expression of conditioned fear memories and cardiovascular alterations. We have 2 specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To demonstrate that angiotensin II-induced activation of brain AT1Rs is necessary and required for the maintenance and reconsolidation of fear memory and the conditioned cardiovascular responses. Specific Aim 2: To demonstrate that activation of brain AT2Rs both stimulates fear-off neurons and reduces fear memory and adverse cardiovascular changes during fear conditioning. These studies will further elucidate the mechanism(s) by which the renin-angiotensin system acts as an important and novel mediator of PTSD pathology, and will provide new targets and opportunities for pharmacological interventions in PTSD and PTSD-related CVD co-morbidity."
"9420465","PROJECT SUMMARY  Aphasia affects approximately one-third of stroke survivors and persists in about 15% of these individuals, resulting in debilitating, life-long impairments in functional communication and severely diminished quality of life. Research has shown that despite persistent deficits, persons with chronic aphasia (PWA) can demonstrate improved language skills with concomitant neurophysiological changes following language therapy. However, response to treatment is variable and there is currently no way to predict the degree to which PWA may recover. One reason for the difficulty in predicting aphasia outcomes is that the mechanisms of beneficial neural reorganization of language are unclear. Specifically, optimal language recovery has been linked to activation in left hemisphere (LH) tissue, yet the specific regions that drive improved performance and the cognitive functions they mediate (i.e., language-specific versus domain-general processes) are unknown. Even less is understood regarding the role of the right hemisphere (RH) in reorganization. Some evidence suggests RH activity for language is maladaptive while other findings indicate RH recruitment is essential when LH lesions are large or when aphasia is severe. This traditional LH versus RH debate appears to oversimplify a complex problem. The alternative, central hypothesis of the proposed research is that language reorganization involves the dynamic recruitment of intact tissue within a bilateral network of anatomically-segregated but functionally and structurally connected language-specific and domain-general brain regions. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. First, effective connectivity (which reflects the causal influence of activated regions on other areas) of a bilateral brain network for two related language tasks (i.e., picture naming and semantic feature verification) will be examined via Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) in 45 PWA and 35 age-matched controls. We will test the hypothesis that the most active hubs and modulatory regions for both tasks will be domain-general left middle frontal gyrus (LMFG) for PWA and language-specific left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) for controls and that best-fit brain models for PWA will include stronger inter-hemispheric interactions than best- fit models in controls. Second, we will examine the extent to which PWAs? language network structural integrity and task-based connectivity predict their language abilities. We will test the hypothesis that greater effective and structural connectivity of anterior regions within the bilateral network predict better language abilities while stronger connectivity of only intra-RH connections will be predictive of poor performance. By achieving these aims, this project will advance our understanding of the nature of beneficial neural reorganization of language in stroke-induced chronic aphasia. Ultimately, such findings can be incorporated into future work to improve our prognostication of long-term recovery and response to therapy in PWA."
"9613328","PROJECT SUMMARY Due to an ever-increasing number of cancer survivors, representing approximately 4.5% of the population in the United States (2014), second malignancies related to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a significant concern in public health. However, underlying mechanisms of second malignancies are poorly understood. While it is well known ionizing radiation can induce cancers in small animal models, whether radiation causes second cancer by creating initiating mutations or by promoting the expansion of cells that harbor a pre-existing mutation remains a field of active study. This knowledge gap represents a substantial barrier to assessing the risk of second malignancies and to develop novel strategies for preventing or mitigating this clinically significant side effect of cancer therapy. The long-term goal of this research is to study how ionizing radiation alters the microenvironment and cell competition within the stem/progenitor pool to promote the development of second hematological malignancies. To successfully launch my independent research program studying this question, I will use this K99/R00 award to achieve my short-term objectives to 1) develop expertise in hematopoiesis and thymopoiesis, 2) gain knowledge and skill sets studying epigenetic changes in the onset and progression of radiation-induced thymic lymphoma, and 3) receive focused training in grant writing, leadership and career development. These three objectives represent areas where continued development is crucial for my successful transition to an independent investigator. The proposed research is innovative in that it challenges the conventional view that radiation causes cancer predominantly by creating new mutations. Instead, this proposal tests the hypothesis that radiation promotes the growth of cells with preexisting mutations. The proposed research is significant because it will provide a mechanism for non-targeted effects of radiation- induced carcinogenesis, which remains poorly understood for over 60 years. Ultimately, the conceptual advances made possible by the proposed research will enable more complete understanding of mouse models of radiation-induced thymic lymphoma and establish a preclinical platform for evaluating novel medical countermeasures against radiation-induced hematological malignancies."
"9431891","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN), which affects nearly 80 million U.S. adults and costs society approximately $80 billion annually, is the leading modifiable cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Current guidelines recommend a standard systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment goal of <140 mmHg in most patients. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed a 25% reduction in CVD events with intensive SBP treatment (<120 mmHg) in high CVD risk adults. However, intensive SBP treatment likely requires additional health care resources and practice changes so it will be challenging to implement in real-world settings. This project proposes to: (1) build and validate a ?hybrid? hypertension treatment simulation model to determine the cost-effectiveness of intensive SBP treatment in a population-based sample of SPRINT-eligible U.S. adults, (2) incorporate local data from diverse health systems into the hybrid blood pressure model to compare the cost-effectiveness of intensive SBP treatment implementation strategies, (3) engage local stakeholders in study design and communication strategies, and (4) disseminate results to local and national stakeholders to optimize intensive SBP treatment implementation. The central hypothesis is that intensive SBP treatment implementation in health systems will be feasible and cost-effective in high CVD risk patients compared to standard treatment even when considering local implementation factors. Most past research using computer simulation methods generates ?average? national population estimates and the models are often considered opaque ?black boxes? by decision makers. This project is innovative as it applies simulation methods to the local health system level, using local patient data, and engages local stakeholders to address practical implementation barriers and facilitators. For intensive SBP treatment, this may result in more efficient and safer implementation, while also reducing the burden of CVD attributed to raised SBP. My career goal is to become a principal investigator and expert focused on the use of computer simulations to improve healthcare delivery, quality, and population health. The proposed career development plan will provide training and mentorship in: (1) advanced computer simulation methods; (2) analysis of individual-level data from clinical trials, observational cohorts, national surveys, and health systems; (3) qualitative methods; and (4) dissemination and communication of computer simulation research results. This training will be achieved through coursework, hands-on experience, and active mentoring. The mentoring team is comprised of nationally recognized experts in hypertension, clinical trials, computer simulation, cost-effectiveness analysis, epidemiology, qualitative methods, and dissemination.!The University of Utah provides an ideal research environment for my transition to independence."
"9471028","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled T Cell Dysfunction, Cancer and Infection, organized by Drs. Daniel C. Douek, W. Nicholas Haining and Jedd D. Wolchok. The conference will be held January 16-20, 2018 at Beaver Run Resort, Colorado. T cell exhaustion is an acquired state of T cell dysfunction, associated with reduced T cell function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors and a transcriptional state that is distinct from memory and effector T cells. T cell exhaustion is now recognized as a defining feature not only of chronic infections such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, but also of cancer. As a result, the search for effective approaches to reverse T cell exhaustion is the focus of immense therapeutic development. However, the similarities and differences between T cell dysfunction arising in chronic infection and tumors are not fully understood. Moreover, opportunities to identify new therapeutic approaches to reverse dysfunction based on parallels between the two disease states remain to be explored. This meeting will focus on the comparative biology and clinical therapeutics of T cell dysfunction in chronic viral infection and cancer. Drawing on leaders in fundamental T cell biology, computational science and clinical investigation, it will focus on common features and distinctive aspects of T cell dysfunction in cancer and chronic infection. The meeting will have broad relevance for T cell biology, tumor immunity, infectious disease and therapeutic development."
"9411429","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Transgender women (TW) are one of the most vulnerable populations for acquiring HIV infection, and the scant available data on transgender men (TM) suggests they are also at risk. TW have accounted for only 0.2% of all participants in bio-behavioral HIV prevention trials using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and TM have typically not been included. TW and TM adolescents have received even less attention in PrEP trials.  Although tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), the FDA-approved PrEP drug, would not be expected to interact with cross-sex hormone therapy (cs-HT; estradiol and testosterone) based on known mechanisms and data from studies with hormonal contraceptives, there are no data that prove this. Given this lack of data, TW and TM youth on cs-HT have decreased PrEP uptake and adherence due to concerns that PrEP may reduce the effectiveness of cs-HT. To address these critical scientific gaps in PrEP safety for transgender youth and to plan for appropriate implementation we propose the following study in 3 integrated phases. In Phase 1, we will conduct a PK study exploring the interactions of cs-HT for both TW and TM on TDF/FTC. Simultaneously, in Phase 2, we will collect ethnographic data via focus groups and in-depth interviews to inform the development of a tailored gender-affirmative intervention to improve uptake and adherence to PrEP in transgender youth. In Phase 3, we will conduct a small demonstration trial of PrEP use in TW and TM youth, utilizing the ethnographically developed intervention to improve uptake and adherence, while also monitoring renal and bone safety outcomes.  The project has the following specific aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the differential PK of TDF/FTC in a cohort of transgender youth on cs-HT by conducting a PK trial of daily TDF/FTC among 24 TW taking estradiol and 24 TM taking testosterone (ages 15-24 years) using video-based directly observed therapy (DOT) to insure daily adherence and maximize drug exposure. Aim 2: To develop a culturally, developmentally, and gender- affirmative intervention to increase uptake of and adherence to PrEP among TW and TM youth that is grounded in theory (Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model of Behavior Change, Gender Affirmation, Empowerment Theory) and incorporates the PK data from Aim 1. We will conduct FGs with young TW (N=20- 30) and TM (N=20-30) and conduct IDIs with participants from the PK study (Total N=10-14). We will solicit continuous input and feedback from TW and TM on the project's Youth Advisory Board. Aim 3: To conduct a small randomized controlled trial within a PrEP demonstration project comparing the newly developed intervention with standard of care (SOC) in TW (N=50) and TM (N=50) ages 15-24 years."
"9469150","PROJECT SUMMARY The centromere is a specialized chromosomal region that is the foundation of the proteinacious kinetochore complex. The kinetochore mediates spindle attachments and ensures high-fidelity segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Regulation of centromere formation during cell division is critical for ensuring high-fidelity transmission of genetic information and is therefore essential for life. Derangements in centromere biology are associated with a wide range of human diseases ranging from sterility to cancer. Specific centromere aberrations observed in aggressive cancers include increased levels of kinetochore protein components, aberrant expression of transcripts from the centromere and expansions of centromeric DNA. Knockdown of kinetochore proteins and centromeric transcripts have been identified as potential cancer targets. However, the process by which centromere dysfunction drives tumorigenesis is unknown. Intriguingly, centromere derangements have also been associated with errors during meiosis. In meiosis, centromere expansion from chromosomal fusions lead to biased transmission of the chromosomal fusions to children in affected women and lead to sterility in affected men. Yet the mechanism by which variation in centromere size leads to meiotic dysfunction remains poorly understood. Three specific aims are proposed to identify the effect of centromere expansions on mitosis and meiosis. A major hurdle in the study of centromere biology is the dearth of tools to specifically create and expand centromeres within a genome. Specific Aim 1 will address this need through the generation of a novel tool for generating inducible, targeted centromeres. In specific aim 2, the role of targeted centromere expansions in a developing D. melanogaster wing will be studied. This will be the first study of the effect of centromere expansion on a euploid developing tissue. Finally, in specific aim 3, the effect of centromere expansion on oogenesis and spermatogenesis will be determined. The results of aim 3 will shed light on the mechanism by which variation in centromere size can lead to meiotic dysfunction. Collectively, these experiments will significantly contribute to the cancer biology, genome structure and evolution fields while also establishing a new approach for generating targetable ectopic centromeres."
"9199241","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) is an inflammatory condition that can increase the morbidity and mortality of mechanically ventilated patients. In the US, estimates suggest 790,257 hospitalizations/year involving mechanical ventilation, with costs of $27 billion, representing 12% of all hospital costs. Our long-term goal s to understand the mechanisms producing VALI, and to advance methods to detect, prevent, and treat it. Neutrophilic inflammation produced by tidal lung strain during mechanical ventilation is  key process in the pathogenesis of VALI. However, it is unclear how that inflammatory response to tidal strain predominantly studied in cell cultures and small animals translates to the mechanically ventilated large animal and human lung. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) techniques coupled with advanced image analysis provide a novel means to quantify regional tidal volumetric lung strain (CT) and neutrophilic inflammation (PET with the glucose analogue tracer 2-Deoxy-2-[18F]Fluoro-D-Glucose, FDG). Our preliminary data indicate a strong linear dependence of FDG-uptake on tidal volumetric strain in inflamed (endotoxin exposed) lungs. These data also suggest that local changes in FDG uptake can detect early signs of lung injury before significant parenchymal damage develops. Aiming at prevention, we propose to study the early stages of mechanical ventilation of the heterogeneously expanding, moderately inflamed lung using currently recommended ventilatory strategies. Our central hypothesis is that regional lung neutrophilic inflammation and underlying metabolic and transcriptional changes depend directly on regional volumetric lung strain, and precede lung parenchymal damage. We will test this hypothesis in sheep models of endotoxemia and 24 hours of mechanical ventilation (Aims 1 and 2) and mechanically ventilated patients (Aim 3) in three aims: (1) To assess the regional effects of tidal lung volumetric strain on pulmonary FDG kinetics, tissue neutrophilic inflammation, and neutrophil gene expression; (2) To ascertain the dependence of regional parenchymal damage, neutrophilic inflammation, and lung dysfunction at 24h of lung injury on earlier (6h) local cellular metabolic activity quantified with FDG-PET; and (3) Within the first 48h of mechanical ventilation in septic patients, to establish the relationship between pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation and regional lung strain as well as the ensuing degree of lung dysfunction. If our hypothesis is correct, regional lung strain will prove to be linearly related to neutrophilic inflammation, challenging current concepts of a safe threshold above which strain causes lung edema and inflammation, and influencing how mechanical ventilation is delivered in intensive care units and operating rooms. Additionally, early neutrophilic inflammation identified by increased FDG uptake will correlate with subsequent parenchymal damage and lung dysfunction as well as with clinical deterioration. Such findings would establish FDG-PET/CT as an early biomarker in the development of VALI, useful for the prediction of functional deterioration and lung injury."
"9455424","R36 Dissertation Proposal Abstract: Risk Factors for Social Isolation among African American Older Adults BACKGROUND: Social isolation is a significant public health issue among older adults in the United States. It is related to a host of negative health outcomes including mortality, worse self- rated physical health, higher depressive symptoms, worse sleep quality, and cognitive decline. Factors associated with social isolation among older adults include living alone, experiencing a significant life change, living in a rural community, belonging to a cultural minority group, having low income, and having severe physical and/or mental disabilities. To the investigator?s knowledge, there are few studies which examine social isolation among African American older adults, few studies that examine risk factors for social isolation among African American older adults, and one study that distinguishes between objective and subjective isolation among older African Americans. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) to determine the risk factors associated with objective and subjective social isolation among older African Americans; and 2) to determine if risk factors associated with objective and subjective social isolation among older African Americans vary by age, gender, and living in a rural or urban environment. The theoretical model which influenced the development of the proposed study is the Convoy Model of Social Relations. The investigator hypothesizes that increases in objective isolation and subjective isolation will be associated with several risk factors, including lower education, lower income, worse self-rated health, increasing neighborhood physical disorder, and decreasing neighborhood social cohesion. Additionally, the investigator hypotheses that risk factors for social isolation among African American older adults vary by age, gender, and living in a rural or urban environment. METHODS: The aims of the proposed study will be addressed using the Health and Retirement Study, Leave Behind Questionnaire dataset, 2008 and 2012 waves. Objective isolation will be operationalized using the social network index, and subjective isolation will be operationalized using the Hughes and colleagues 3 item loneliness scale. Descriptive statistics, T-Tests, ANOVAs, and multivariate regression analyses using lagged variables will be calculated. In general, social isolation at 2012 is regressed on social isolation and all risk factors in 2008. Additionally, interaction terms, testing the moderating effects of age, gender, and living in a rural or urban environment, will be used to address the study aims. Knowledge generated from the proposed study will be useful for designing ethnically tailored social isolation risk assessments, tailored isolation reducing interventions, and for policy and program development to decrease isolation among all older adults.

"9422602","Glioblastoma is a primary cancer of the central nervous system. Unfortunately, current treatments are unable to control the invasiveness of the tumor, leading to a 95% recurrence rate. Moreover, although radiation therapy has produced the largest improvement in survival for these patients, it is also associated with increased tumor invasiveness, perhaps contributing to the high recurrence rate. Our preliminary work suggests that CD147, a protein which is commonly overexpressed in glioblastoma, may contribute to this invasion, in particular the increased invasion after radiation exposure. Interestingly, CD147 works to promote invasion in cancer cells via intercellular communication: carcinomas secrete CD147 to induce neighboring fibroblasts to produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade the extracellular matrix. In glioblastoma, we have found that extracellular vesicles from glioblastoma cells not only contain CD147, but their CD147 levels are higher if the cells are irradiated. Similarly, we found that glioblastoma cells release extracellular vesicles that increase MMP production in astrocytes, and that MMP production is further increased if the extracellular vesicles are from irradiated glioblastoma cells. Together, these studies suggest that CD147 may play a key role in both the invasiveness of glioblastoma tumors and the increased invasion observed following irradiation. Therefore, this study proposes two specific aims to test the central hypothesis that glioblastoma cells use extracellular vesicles containing CD147 to mediate a pro-invasive environment. We further hypothesize that radiation increases the levels of CD147 in extracellular vesicles, resulting in increased invasiveness.  In Aim 1, we will examine in vitro whether CD147 in the extracellular vesicles of glioblastoma cells can induce astrocytes and microglia to promote invasion through MMP production, and whether radiation enhances this process. Through knockdown of CD147, we will examine how CD147 controls drivers of invasion by analyzing the MMP protein and mRNA levels, the amount and activity of secreted MMPs, and the signaling pathways leading to MMP production. We will also test the effects of CD147 on functional endpoints using invasion and migration assays. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate in vivo that CD147 is an important mediator of tumor invasiveness, in particular after radiation exposure. We will use an orthotopic mouse model of glioma consisting of wild-type and CD147-knockdown tumor cells. Using a state-of-the-art system that mimics clinical therapy, we will perform specific CT-image guided X-ray irradiation of the tumors. We will examine differences in survival, number of metastases in the brain, and immunohistological endpoints. Radiation is expected to increase invasion in the CD147 wild-type tumors, relative to non-irradiated controls. However, we predict that the combination of radiation and CD147 knockdown will act synergistically to generate the lowest level of invasion among the groups. These results may suggest CD147 inhibitors as an important adjuvant to radiation therapy, contributing to reduced invasion and thus improved patient survival."
"9308254","Today's policymakers must wade through an overwhelming amount of information to establish a knowledge base for decision-making. Thus, good policy outcomes require thoughtful communication of scientific research. Effective translation of Duke SRC research results holds the potential to contribute substantially to the practice of environmental health across NC and nationally. We have three primary audiences for the efforts of the Research Translation Core: (1) scientists at other universities and state and federal agencies (including NIEHS and SRCs at other universities) working on similar questions; (2) environmental health  officials and policy makers in state and federal agencies; and (3) community-based groups and non-profits, charged with protecting human health and the environment. Specific aims for the RTC include: 1) To serve as a bi-directional bridge between the Duke SRC and community groups and other broad-based audiences; 2) To communicate with other SRC and NIEHS SRC staff, and national, state, and local environmental health officials regarding the contributions of Center research to contemporary scientific issues; 3) To disseminate environmental health research and messages to communities that have traditionally been underserved in outreach and translation efforts, with a particular emphasis on the rapidly growing Hispanic population in North Carolina; 4) To use advanced spatial analysis to characterize relationships among contaminants, exposure, and environmental health policy, and then make these results available through the research translation process; and 5)To participate in the transfer of technology from Center investigators to specific end-user audiences. In past years. Center Investigators have contributed significantly to RTC  activities, and we are enthusiastic about continuing this collaborative approach. Opportunities for synergy in research translation are created by the SRC's focus on developmental effects from chemical exposure and toxicity and a campus-wide emphasis on the special vulnerabilities of children.

"9453090","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT RESEARCH: The goal of this proposal is to investigate the clinical and genetic predictors of childhood respiratory disease in former preterm infants. We hypothesize that bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), poor somatic growth, smoke exposure, and genetic variants will be associated with reduced lung growth and obstructive lung disease in former preterm infants. Furthermore, network analysis will reveal shared biology between BPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma. The specific aims expand an existing patient registry, including over 780 former preterm infants with and without BPD who are followed at the Center for Healthy Infant Lung Development at Boston Children?s Hospital. This will include obtaining longitudinal lung function measures and survey data on smoke exposure, as well as initiating a DNA bank of buccal swab specimens. We will perform genome-wide genotyping, and examine specific associations with 48 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with COPD and lung function. We will leverage existing data from other populations with poor lung growth, and respiratory diseases including BPD, asthma, and COPD, to identify networks and pathways that may define lifelong susceptibility to reduced lung growth and obstructive lung disease, ultimately influencing prognosis, outcomes, and treatment response. This work will stimulate basic discoveries about the causes of BPD and COPD, and enable the translation of these discoveries into clinical practice. CANDIDATE: Lystra P.

"9591322","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The morphological diversity among neurons is enormous and critical to their function, yet many gaps in our knowledge remain concerning how this diversity is genetically encoded. As with vertebrate motor neurons, the motor neurons of Drosophila melanogaster establish highly specific synapses on the correct muscle fibers in the appendages and also elaborate highly stereotyped dendritic arbors in the central nervous system (CNS). In the previous funding period, this diversity of motor neuron morphology was defined at the single cell level for the 47 motor neurons that innervate and control the movements of each of the adult legs of Drosophila. Further, sets of transcription factors were characterized that act in a combinatorial manner to dictate the morphologies of seven motor neurons, all derived from the same neuroblast stem cell. An additional set of factors was defined that are expressed in a temporally distinct manner in a stem cell lineage that gives rise to 28 motor neurons. Based on these findings, one goal for the next funding period is to determine how combinatorial TF codes are established in post-mitotic neurons, by testing the hypothesis that they are regulated by factors acting earlier in the neuroblast. A second goal is to identify te genes and pathways regulated by TFs in post-mitotic motor neurons that control their synaptic specificity in the adult legs and dendritic architecture in the CNS. A combination of genetic screens and molecular approaches will be used. A third long term goal is to determine how the adult leg muscles develop coordinately with motor neurons to establish synaptic specificity. Using a highly quantitative method for analyzing fly walking, the consequences on walking behavior by perturbing the development of these neurons and/or muscles will be analyzed. In general, these studies will link the development of a highly stereotyped set of neurons to their function in a specific adult behavior."
"9448257","Summary  Complete genome duplication requires a close collaboration between the replication machinery and many regulatory factors. These factors can assist replisomes in coping with large numbers of template obstacles, and their defects are frequently associated with human diseases such as cancer and DNA damage syndromes. It is our long-term goal to understand how replication regulatory proteins interact with the replisome and aid replication. We and others have shown that the evolutionarily conserved Smc5/6 complex is essential for promoting replication under normal and DNA damaging conditions. During the last two cycles of this grant, we have made significant progress in elucidating the structure of this complex, its unique SUMO E3 activity, and its multiple effects on genome maintenance in the budding yeast model system.  Importantly and most relevant to the current proposal, we recently showed that Smc5/6 and its binding partner, the scaffold protein Rtt107, comprise a new pathway that aids large replicon synthesis. Large replicons are difficult to duplicate and strongly associated with fragile sites and other forms of genomic instability. Investigating the mechanisms by which Smc5/6 and Rtt107 facilitate large replicon synthesis will broaden our understanding of the maintenance of high-risk genomic regions. We found that Smc5/6 and Rtt107 interact with DNA polymerase and helicase complexes and contribute to their sumoylation. Moreover, these sumoylation events influence replication. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Smc5/6 and Rtt107 directly promote replisome function to aid large replicon synthesis. Extending from this work, we showed that Rtt107 is the hub of a protein network composed of Smc5/6 and other genome maintenance factors. How Rtt107 supports the interactions within this network and how each interaction contributes to replication are important questions to address.  In the next funding cycle, we propose to test our hypothesis stated above by examining how Smc5/6 and Rtt107 affect replication fork functions during large replicon synthesis, and define the biochemical features of the Smc5/6 and Rtt107 interactions with DNA polymerase and helicase complexes. In addition, we will determine how the sumoylation of DNA polymerase and helicase complexes affects the initiation and elongation stages of replication. Findings from these studies will shed light on the roles of Smc5/6, Rtt107, and SUMO in promoting the completion of large replicon synthesis. Finally, we will investigate the biochemical basis of Rtt107-mediated interactions and the functions of each interaction. To achieve these goals, we will use a combination of genetic, biochemical, biophysical approaches in the highly effective yeast system. Outcomes of the proposed work will expand our view on how large replicon synthesis is achieved, how SUMO regulates replication, and how the Rtt107 interactome contributes to genome duplication. As such, these studies will have broad implications in our understanding of genome maintenance mechanisms."
"9427370","Project summary Active modulation of host function is essential for the success of bacterial pathogens. The ubiquitin network regulates virtually every cellular process in eukaryotes, particularly those involved in the detection, recognition and response to infection. Accordingly, many pathogens target host ubiquitination for their benefits. Earlier studies revealed that Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, interferes with host ubiquitin signaling by using at least 9 of its Dot/Icm effectors. Our recent study revealed that members of the SidE effector family feature enzymatic domains with unique activities for manipulating ubiquitin signals. First, these proteins contain a deubiquitinase (DUB) module that efficiently removes ubiquitin from ubiquitinated proteins. Second, these proteins catalyze ubiquitination by an unusual mechanism: the reaction does not require the E1, E2 enzymes or ATP, factors that are essential for all described ubiquitination events. Furthermore, these novel ubiquitin manipulating effectors are required for maximal intracellular bacterial replication, which differs sharply with the majority of L. pneumophila Dot/Icm type IV effectors. As an additional layer of complexity, we find that the biological activity of SidE effectors is regulated by the SidJ effector through its reversal of the SidE-catalyzed ubiquitination by a mechanism that appears to distinctly differ from classical DUBs. By biochemical and structural analyses, we will study the mechanism of action of these proteins. Different functional domains encoded in these effectors seem to work in concert to regulate each other for a balanced control of host functions. We will study biochemical basis of functional integration among distinct activities present within these effectors. These studies will not only reveal novel mechanisms of host function exploitation by intracellular pathogens, but also will have the potential to revise the current understanding of ubiquitination, an enormously important signaling mechanism."
"9412123","Borrelia burgdorferi is one of an increasing number of bacterial pathogens that can incorporate and metabolize cholesterol from the host. This organism requires cholesterol to grow but it lacks the metabolic machinery to synthetize it. In previous studies in our laboratory, we showed that cholesterol is key for maintaining the integrity and properties of the outer membrane of B. burgdorferi. Importantly, cholesterol is essential for pathogenesis of Lyme disease since cholesterol and cholesterol glycolipids form microdomains in the membranes of the spirochetes with all the hallmarks of eukaryotic lipid rafts, and that it may have important physiological functions. Despite the requirement for cholesterol, little is known regarding the effects of high cholesterol levels in serum, in tissues or in the accumulation of fat in tissues targeted by B. burgdorferi in Lyme disease patients. In a recent study [Toledo et al PNAS 2015], we showed that elevated levels of serum cholesterol, achieved with a short term high fat diet in cholesterol-transport deficient mice of two different genotypes [apolipoprotein E (apoE-), and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-) deficient] resulted in increased arthritis as well as increased number of spirochetes in the joints. These results alerted us to the possibility that hyperlipidemias could be a comorbidity factor for: i. increased acute Lyme disease severity; ii. Increased persistence of spirochetes in tissue, and iii. dissemination to and colonization of tissues with high lipid concentrations. Based on the hyphotesis that B. burgdorferi can exploit the excess of serum cholesterol leading to enhanced acute and chronic infection, and that hyperlipidemias are comorbid factors for Lyme disease, we propose the following: Specific Aim 1. To determine whether chronic hypercholesterolemia affect the overall pathogenicity of B. burgdorferi in the murine model of Lyme disease with two subaims to determine whether acute or chronic infection of B. burgdorferi is enhanced by hypercholesterolemia in WT and LDLR- mice; Specific Aim 2. To evaluate the role of subcutaneous adipose and intra-abdominal fat in the dissemination of the spirochete.  "
"9471172","Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., ?blended? emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic ?signatures? of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse."

In vitro model studies7 conducted on synthetic 2 suggest that these natural products may cross-link of DNA, but no experimental evidence using isolated oligonucleotides in vitro or seeking markers of DNA alkylation in culture have been disclosed. DNA-reactive agents comprise a considerable portion of the modern chemotherapeutic arsenal.8?11 Moreover, the purported mechanism of action of 1 and 2 closely resembles that of the illudin family of natural products12?17, a derivative of which (irofulven, 3, Figure 1)18,19 advanced to Phase II and III clinical trials as a chemotherapeutic for the treatment of breast, gastric, and pancreatic cancers, among others.12,20 The development of 3 exemplifies the underexplored potential of DNA cross- linking natural products as a viable source of chemotherapeutic agents. Total synthesis of 1 represents an essential first step in translational development toward a potential novel chemotherapeutic. Ready access to 1 could also provide a chemical tool for biological studies involving DNA cross-linking, which may ultimately result in further insight into important biological processes such as DNA repair. With biological evaluation and translational development of 1 as the ultimate goal, the synthetic route toward 1 is designed to be scalable and concise. The overall strategy centers on joining two complex cyclohexyl fragments through a robust acetylide addition, with a subsequent Heck-type cyclization envisioned to construct the final carbocyclic ring of the target. Specific aims entail: 1) development of syntheses of the two cyclohexyl precursor fragments of 1, 2) synthesis of the model system and analogue 4, and 3) completion of the synthesis of 1 using conditions developed for synthesis of 4. As projected, the total synthesis of 1 should be achieved in 15 steps. The long-term goals of this project include intensive mechanism of action studies of 1, design and synthesis of analogues for structure?function studies, elucidation of the activity and cell line selectivities of 1, and validation of 1 as a lead for translational development.

"9405893","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in the X-linked gene that encodes MeCP2 (MECP2) are the cause of Rett Syndrome in girls. MECP2 duplication syndrome is an X-linked genomic disorder that accounts for 1-2% of all cases of X-linked intellectual disability (ID), primarily in boys. It is characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, infantile hypotonia, ID progressive neurological declines, and poor to absent speech. Data suggest that there are two distinct clinical paths in this syndrome. One path affects an estimated 50% of the population and is characterized by a dramatic loss of motor skills (regression) that eventually leads to death before the age of 25 resulting from complications of recurrent lower respiratory infections, suggesting possible immune deficits. In contrast, the other path is milder and includes individuals who maintain their milestones and have fewer infections. No study has examined the basis for these two alternative disease paths, or the contributing factors that lead toward a path of decline. The age of regression onset varies between 3-16 years. In addition to specific clinical markers, we have recently discovered that there are immune markers associated with regression that may account for the high frequency of respiratory infections, including impaired functioning of Th1 cells that make the cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-?), and lower vaccine titers. We have also found that decreased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (a marker of stress) is associated with regression. This application therefore proposes a longitudinal study consisting of three annual evaluations of the clinical, immune, and stress markers of regression in males between the ages of 3-12 years with MECP2 duplication syndrome. The specific aims are: 1) To determine whether increased respiratory infections, lower cognition, seizures, and increased social withdrawal predict regression status in MECP2 duplication syndrome, 2) To determine whether suppression of IFN-? from Th1 cells and lower influenza vaccine titers predicts regression status, and 3) To determine whether HPA axis hypoactivity predicts regression status. Completion of this study will immediately affect clinical practice through implementation of better guidelines for yearly vaccines, and guidelines for possible immune therapy. It will also lay the foundation for a future treatment study testing whether drugs known to improve functioning of TH1 cells normalize or improve clinical course, enhance HPA axis activity, and therefore improve quality of life. Finally, completion of our aims will also have broader public health significance for autoimmune disorders consistently associated with MeCP2 overexpression, including: lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis."
"9605811","Summary A central challenge in neuroscience is to develop methods to manipulate specific cell types within the mammalian brain. Recent developments in optogenetics have revolutionized our ability to control the activity of both neurons and non-neuronal cells. However, this approach suffers from one drawback, the difficulty in delivery light stimulus to target cells that are located deep within the brain or the body. The Chalasani lab has recently demonstrated a noninvasive method to control the activity of neurons. They have identified a pore- forming subunit of a mechanosensitive channel (TRP-4) that responds to low-intensity ultrasound. Further, they showed that expressing this channel is specific cells renders those target cells sensitive to mechanical deformations generated by noninvasive ultrasound waves. This proposal aims to develop this approach (they have termed ?sonogenetics?) to control specific cells within the mouse brain. Further, they find that this approach can be used to control the activity of mammalian neurons in vitro. They plan on using a high- throughput assay system to test whether other members of the TRP-N family are sensitive to ultrasound pulses. Additionally, they will also analyze whether altering the number of ankyrin repeats affects the ultrasound responsiveness of these channels (consistent with a recent study showing similar results in the Drosophila TRP-N channel) (Aim 1). They also plan on developing a new head device with a slot for a tiny, lightweight ultrasound transducer to deliver ultrasound stimulus to the mouse brain (Aim 2). Finally, they will test the efficacy of the sonogenetic approach in vivo using electrophysiological and behavioral analysis. They will express TRP-4 or other mechanosensitive channels in cortical PV interneurons, striatal D1 or D2 medium spiny projection neurons and control their activity in vivo. Optogenetic methods have been previously used to control these cell populations providing benchmarks for comparison. These studies will develop a noninvasive method to manipulate the activity of specific cells within the rodent brain or its body. Further, these methods can be translated into the human to target specific cell populations for therapeutic purposes."
"9431594","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical advances have made it possible for premature infants to survive in increasing numbers. However, the increased survival at early gestational ages is accompanied with increased morbidity. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most prevalent major complication of premature birth affecting at least one quarter of infants born with a birth weight less than 1500g. Alarmingly, the rate of BPD is increasing, while rates of several other in-hospital complications of premature birth have dropped. BPD predisposes premature infants to a higher mortality and morbidity risk both in the immediate neonatal period as well as after discharge form the neonatal intensive care unit. Many survivors of premature birth will continue to have persistent respiratory symptoms and decreased lung function into adulthood. In addition to the respiratory complications, BPD is also one of the strongest predictors of neurodevelopmental impairment. These life-long complications of BPD create significant health burden and necessitate extensive health care utilization. Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD. Key pathogenic mechanisms of the disease are not completely understood and therefore we lack a clear path for development of new therapies. One factor that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of BPD is oxygen administration, used as a life-saving intervention after premature birth. Exposure of the immature lung to increased levels of oxygen results in a profound inflammatory response that permanently disrupts normal lung development. However, not every premature infant is equally sensitive to oxygen-induced injury. Therefore, identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to oxygen induced inflammation and variance in individual susceptibility has the potential to establish new therapeutic targets. I propose to build on recent conceptual, technical and computational advances to identify the innate immune cells that initiate and maintain the pathologic inflammatory response in BPD. After identifying the disease-relevant cells, I will apply state of the art sequencing techniques to study their gene expression and the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression. Using computational analysis I will integrate the genetic and epigenetic data to identify candidate genes that are likely to drive the pathology in BPD and contribute to individual differences in disease susceptibility. Understanding the fundamental biology of gene expression and regulation in innate immune cells in the developing lung will not only benefit premature infants with BPD, but could be harnessed for therapeutic purposes in several other respiratory diseases.  "
"9517218","The ultimate goal of this proposal is to elucidate the novel antiviral mechanism of host BAG3; a newly discovered filovirus VP40 interacting protein that inhibits viral egress. Filoviruses (Ebola [EBOV] and Marburg [MARV]) are Category A, high-priority pathogens, for which there are no commercially available vaccines or therapeutic agents. Thus, exploratory and innovative approaches are warranted to better understand viral-host interactions that both promote and inhibit the transmission of these deadly viruses. Our laboratory focuses on the mechanisms by which filoviruses interact with and recruit host proteins to regulate the budding process. Here, we identified an unanticipated interaction between filovirus VP40 and the host protein BAG3. BAG3 is a stress-regulated, co-chaperone protein whose function is to ensure cell survival and protein homeostasis via Chaperone-Assisted Selective Autophagy (CASA). While BAG3 has been shown to positively influence entry and replication for some viruses, we found that the interaction of the PPxY motif of both EBOV and MARV VP40 with the single N-terminal WW-domain of BAG3 leads to an unexpected decrease in egress of both EBOV and MARV VP40 virus-like particles (VLPs), as well as VSV recombinant viruses that serve as functional EBOV surrogates, as they are genetically engineered to express either EBOV VP40 WT or mutant L-domains in place of the L-domain of VSV M. We hypothesize that BAG3 expression is induced following filovirus infection, and that BAG3 targets VP40 for removal and/or sequestration from the site of budding at the plasma membrane. We will use a rigorous multifaceted approach to interrogate the mechanisms by which BAG3 disrupts virus particle egress, thus providing new insight into the potential role of CASA as a novel and specific host defense strategy to counteract the ability of VP40 to promote efficient egress and spread of virus particles."
"9388383","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a great amount of evidence for the presence of alternatively activated M2 macrophages in asthmatic allergic inflammation. Our published studies indicated that the macrophage is necessary for asthmatic inflammation. Despite ample reports showing that the alveolar macrophages of asthmatics express different cell surface markers and unique patterns of gene expression, the mechanism of phenotypic transformation of the macrophage to the M2 phenotype, along with its cellular functions involved in asthma pathogenesis, are not fully elucidated. In aim 1, using both the human SBP-AG protocol and a comparable mouse model, we will precisely measure macrophage trafficking and population shifts of alveolar macrophage in acute allergic inflammation. We reported a rapid development of chemotactic gradient for macrophages and the appearance of newly recruited alveolar macrophages in acute allergic inflammation. We will examine if blocking of monocyte recruitment attenuates allergic inflammation. In aim 2, we will investigate CSF-1 as a key regulator for M2 macrophage transformation, and interrogate our recently reported ATX-LPA pathway as a CSF-dependent effector product of M2 macrophages in allergic airway inflammation. Autotaxin (ATX) and its enzymatic product, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of asthma, and alternatively activated macrophages are potential main sources of ATX protein in the asthmatic lung. We will investigate the mechanism for regulating ATX and LPA production in macrophage by employing novel cell specific targeted knock-out mice. In aim 3, we will investigate biochemical pathways of LPA production in allergic lung inflammation, focusing on PLA2 group 7, which is a candidate enzyme that produces lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC). Although ATX action on LPC was identified as the final step of the enzymatic pathway of LPA production, production of LPC from corresponding phosphatidylcholine (PC) is yet to be defined. Our supporting data strongly suggested that macrophage produced PLA2 group 7 is a strong candidate for the reaction, and could be a target for therapeutic intervention. The proposed study would lead to a better understanding of pathogenesis of asthma, which will eventually improve management of asthma."
"9546193","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood Adversity and Cardiovascular Health among Puerto Rican youth Shakira F Suglia Latinos, the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority group in the United States, are vulnerable to the health related consequences of living in poverty; 32 percent are obese and 22 percent have hypertension. Puerto Rican women have the highest rate of obesity, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia than any other Latino subgroup. Recent research has demonstrated that childhood adversity is associated with cardiovascular disease in adulthood. However, adapting and coping behaviors that prime those exposed to adversity in childhood to develop poor cardiovascular outcomes remain largely unexplored. Understanding how childhood adversity affects obesity, blood pressure and inflammation as well as understanding the potential modifiers and mediators of these associations prior to the development of cardiovascular disease directly addresses the strategic plan of NHLBI to promote early intervention before symptoms of disease appear so as to preserve normal function as long as possible. The goal of this application is to conduct a cardiovascular health assessment of 1,200 Puerto Rican young adults (ages 18-23) living in two different contexts: the South Bronx, NY and San Juan, Puerto Rico. The sample to be recruited is part of the Boricua Youth Study (BYS), a longitudinal (4 waves of data) population-based study that started collecting information when participants were 5 - 13 years old (compliance rate higher than 80 percent in the last completed assessment). In this unique sample of a homogeneous Latino subgroup (Puerto Ricans) in two contexts, we propose to examine: 1) the relation between childhood adversity (negative life events, parental incarceration, psychopathology and substance use, child maltreatment) and selected indicators of cardiovascular heath (obesity, blood pressure and systemic inflammation) in young adulthood; 2) the mediating effect of child mental and substance use disorders; and 3) the role played by socio-cultural factors, including context, social support, acculturation and use of health services The research team has expertise in the study of social determinants of health, the effects of stress on health, as well as on adolescent health. Dr. Suglia (PI) has conducted a feasibility study (K01 HL103199) among BYS participants (N=103; 17-23 years old) in the South Bronx, NY and San Juan, Puerto Rico and has demonstrated good feasibility of cardiovascular health data collection as well as a high prevalence of cardiovascular health indicators of interest (obesity=30 percent; elevated blood pressure=22 percent and high systemic inflammation=23 percent). Extending the study to a larger sample (N=1,200) will allow higher precision in the estimate of cardiovascular measures, as well as the examination of mediators and modifiers of the childhood adversity and cardiovascular health association that can be targeted for prevention efforts among young Puerto Rican (and possibly other Latino) youth prior to the development of cardiovascular disease."
"9423525","The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire ?universe? of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions."
"9468796","Project Summary/Abstract This proposed training plan will provide high-quality professional development for the applicant through the pursuit of experiments designed to determine the impact of chronic exercise, physical inactivity, and cardiovascular disease on mechanisms that mediate endothelial cell function, with the goals of addressing a critical barrier to our current understanding of cardiovascular disease and eventual application of these mechanisms towards the clinical treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. The isoenzyme 6- phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) regulates glycolytic metabolism and is essential for endothelial cell function. Understanding the role of PFKFB3 in endothelial cell metabolism and function has recently emerged, and as a result the current literature merely describes the effect of cardiovascular disease on perturbations in endothelial cell metabolism and function. Research identifying the mechanisms underlying the development of cardiovascular disease-induced deregulations in endothelial cell metabolism and function are non-existent. Indeed, a lack of chronic exercise (physical inactivity) reduces endothelial function and increases the risk for cardiovascular disease, whereas chronic exercise training ameliorates cardiovascular disease risk and enhances vascular function. The possibility that chronic exercise may confer protection against cardiovascular disease through functional adaptations in endothelial cell metabolism has not been addressed. Therefore, the overall goal of the present application, in combination with carefully integrated career development activities and mentors with expertise in biology, cell metabolism, and exercise physiology, is to describe the extent to which endothelial metabolism mediates the function of endothelial cells across a spectrum of cardiovascular disease risk, from the atheroprotective effects conferred through chronic exercise at one end, to the physical inactivity-induced manifestation of endothelial dysfunction in the middle, to overt cardiovascular disease on the other end as an extreme. Serum samples collected from individuals who perform chronic exercise, physically inactive but healthy participants, and patients with overt cardiovascular disease will be cultured on human umbilical vein endothelial cells to isolate the effect of circulating factors on endothelial cell metabolism and function. In the final set of experiments, serum from the aforementioned populations will be cultured on human umbilical vein endothelial cells with PFKFB3 either overexpressed or knocked down to determine how alterations in endothelial cell metabolism mediate endothelial cell function across the spectrum of cardiovascular disease risk. Identifying the role of endothelial metabolism in vascular homeostasis will have far broader implications than exercise alone, with the results of the proposed experiments addressing a critical barrier to our current understanding of cardiovascular disease and eventual application of these mechanisms to viable therapeutic interventions designed to ameliorate and prevent cardiovascular disease."
"9590132","Project Summary Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Inflammation, oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction (impaired endothelial function and increased large elastic artery stiffness), are highly prevalent in CKD and contribute to the high incidence of CVD in this patient population. In addition, patients with CKD suffer from high rates of cognitive decline for which we lack effective therapies. Thus, therapeutic interventions targeting inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment in CKD are a biomedical priority. Curcumin is a natural polyphenol with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. It is safe and widely-available. Our preliminary data in old mice and healthy middle-aged (MA)/older adult humans indicate that curcumin administration improves endothelial dysfunction and large artery stiffness by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. We also found that 12 weeks of curcumin supplementation improves episodic memory in MA/older adults. The primary goal of this R01 application is to extend our findings in healthy MA/older adults to patients with CKD, a growing clinical population with extensive baseline vascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment who presently have few treatment options. We propose that curcumin improves vascular endothelial function and large elastic artery stiffness in MA/older adults with stage IIIb and IV CKD (estimated GFR 15- 45 mL/min/1.73m2). We also will assess the possible mechanisms by which curcumin improves vascular function, and determine if curcumin improves cognitive function in these patients. Specific aim 1a will determine if 6 months of curcumin supplementation will improve brachial artery-flow mediated dilation (BA-FMD) (endothelial function) and aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) (arterial stiffness) compared to placebo (randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded study). Specific aim 1b will evaluate whether the curcumin-induced improvements in BA-FMD and aPWV are mediated by reduced oxidative stress, and will evaluate the effects of curcumin on systemic and endothelial cell markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Importantly, specific aim 2 will evaluate the effects of curcumin supplementation on cognitive function, an important complication of CKD, using the NIH Cognitive Toolbox Battery. The study will be conducted by a highly experienced team of investigators at the Clinical and Translational Research Centers at the University of Colorado at 2 campuses that enjoy a collaborative relationship (the Denver Anschutz Medical Campus and the Boulder Campus). Overall, the study has the potential to influence clinical practice guidelines in patients with CKD by establishing a novel, safe, and low-cost dietary supplement to reduce the burden of CVD in patients with CKD."
"9465711","Project Summary: Hunger biases attention to food predicating stimuli (e.g. restaurant logos) over other less relevant stimuli. In obese individuals, this biased attention to food cues persists even when individuals are no longer hungry. How attention is selectively biased to food cues in a state-dependent manner is still poorly understood. Understanding how internal signals shift attention selectively to food images is critical for determining the pathophysiology of obesity and developing new therapeutics to prevent excessive food consumption. This project will investigate the possibility that, during hunger, specific neuromodulatory signals (dopamine and ghrelin) selectively bias populations of basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons that are important for updating the moment-to-moment value of predictive cues. Levels of dopamine rise in response to unexpected rewards and reward-predicating cues. They also vary with internal state indicating that dopaminergic projections to amygdala may modulate value processing in a state-dependent manner. In addition, during hunger, circulating levels of the stomach-derived hormone ghrelin, the only known peripheral signal that can drive feeding in animals including humans, are elevated. In addition to its behavioral effects, ghrelin injections in humans enhance responses in the cortex, amygdala, and mesolimbic dopamine areas to food images.  Recent work in our lab has found that neurons in insular cortex (InsCtx), a visceral/gustatory area that is important for interoception, show biased responses to food predicting cues after learning and these biased responses are modulated by hunger. Connections between BLA and InsCtx may be important for updating the value of food cues as animals go from being hungry to sated. I will address whether dopamine and ghrelin actions in BLA can selectively bias food cue responding neurons by imaging BLA axons in InsCtx and asking the following main questions: 1) Do separate BLA neurons respond to food cues versus aversive cues 2) Does dopaminergic input to BLA gate food cue responses of BLA neurons in hungry animals 3) Are ghrelin receptor expressing (GhSR+) BLA neurons food cue biased and modulated by hunger state?  To determine if subsets of BLA neurons respond to food cues versus aversive cues, I will image BLA axons in InsCtx using a microprism implanted alongside InsCtx, which allows for chronic imaging in awake, behaving mice for many weeks (Aim 1). To ask how dopamine activity affects BLA activity, I will monitor the activity of dopamine axons in BLA using fiber photometry and use chemogenetic tools to manipulate the activity of dopamine neurons (Aim 2). To test whether GhSR+ BLA neurons preferentially respond to food cues over aversive cues, I will use a novel GhSR transgenic mouse line to selectively label these neurons allowing me to identify their axons in InsCtx (Aim 3). These studies will begin to define the mechanisms underlying the hunger-dependent sensory processing ? a key step towards development of strategies to reduce overattention to unhealthy food cues."
"9623991","Obesity and related complications such as fatty liver disease and diabetes pose a growing threat to population health in the United States and around the world. A greater understanding of the dietary factors and cellular mechanisms that lead to the development of obesity is essential to devising preventive and therapeutic strategies to combat these metabolic diseases. Oxidative stress, such as that induced by consumption of highfat diets, is thought to be a causal factor in the development of obesity. Oxidative stress induces damage to cellular components, including DNA, which, if left unrepaired, can lead to mutations and tumorigenesis. Oxidative DNA lesions are repaired by the base-excision repair pathway, which is initiated by DNA glycosylases such as 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1). OGG1 recognizes and excises the most commonly formed oxidative DNA lesion, 8-oxo-G. Interestingly, mice deficient in OGG1 have been recently reported to be susceptible to obesity and fatty liver, indicating an unexpected but critical role for this DNA repair enzyme in the development of metabolic disease. The overall goal of this project is to delineate the mechanisms that link oxidative DNA damage to obesity and metabolic syndrome and to identify dietary factors contributing to the development or prevention of DNA damage. Preliminary data have indicated that OGG1 deficient mice have increased hepatic lipid accumulation, along with markers of decreased fat oxidation in the liver. These mice also display impaired glucose tolerance and alterations in markers of mitochondrial morphology in skeletal muscle. The first two aims of this project will therefore address the mechanistic role of DNA damage in altering hepatic lipid oxidation and skeletal muscle mitochondrial dynamics. These aims will be completed with the aid of novel cellular and transgenic models of obesity resulting from a defect in DNA repair deficiency and established methods to measure DNA damage, fat oxidation, mitochondrial morphology and respiration, and insulin signaling. The completion of these aims will further our understanding of oxidative stress-induced damage in the initiation and progression of fatty liver disease, as well as impaired insulin sensitivity, which can ultimately lead to the development of diabetes. With the knowledge gained from these studies, the third aim will broaden the investigation to delineate the role of dietary fatty acids of varying degrees of desaturation in the induction of DNA damage in metabolically active tissues, including liver, heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. Additionally, the third aim will utilize a newly developed transgenic mouse model overexpressing mitochondrial OGG1 to determine the role of dietary fat exposure and mitochondrial DNA repair in altering mitochondrial function and cell viability. This critical aim will address significant gaps in our understanding of the interplay between diet, DNA damage, and metabolic disease. The knowledge gained from the completion of this final aim will also guide future research focused on developing novel targeted therapeutics to combat metabolic dysfunction by modulating pathways of DNA damage recognition and repair."
"9399650","GENETIC ANIMAL MODELS CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY The Genetic Animal Models core will be co-directed by Hans-Christian Reinecker and Cornelis Terhorst. Services offered by the Genetic Animals Models Core include (1) breeding and maintenance of mutant mouse stocks, (2) characterization of murine models, (3) cell isolation from and characterization of murine models of IBD; (4) cell type-specific gene targeting and depletion; (5) bone marrow transfers and adoptive T cell transfers; (6) maintenance of GFP- and RFP-based reporter mice; (7) in vivo tracking of fluorescent cells and labeled bacteria; (8) mouse brightfield and fluorescent endoscopy, (9) whole-body imaging of bioluminescent and fluorescent signals, (10) intravital imaging of immune cells using multiphoton intravital microscopy, and (12) new murine model development. Within the 163 genetic associations currently known to be associated with risk of IBD, an increasing number of rare variants have highlighted the significance of the relationship between intracellular responses to microbes and regulation of adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of IBD. However, the in vivo functional context in which these genetic variations affect epithelial intestinal function and immune responses remains to be elucidated. To address this need, the Core will assist investigators in using or developing model systems to examine the cell-specific function of variants, and will provide support for examining the functional role of these variants and their contribution to barrier function and innate and adaptive immunity. The specific aims of the Genetic Animal Models Core are to (1) support investigations in mice aimed at elucidating the contribution of IBD-related genetic variants and related genes to the pathogenesis of IBD in humans; (2) facilitate functional in vitro and in vivo imaging of cellular responses and migration in the mucosal and peripheral immune system; and (3) support sharing of model systems and tools to foster collaborations among CSIBD investigators."
"9411633","Project Summary/Abstract  Exposure to high concentrations of Manganese (Mn) can cause irreversible neuronal injury in both adults and children associated with neurobehavioral, motor and cognitive deficits. Our laboratory previously demonstrated using mouse models that inflammatory changes in glial (brain) cells as a result of Mn exposure during development lead to increased susceptibility to neurological dysfunction later in life. Gram-negative bacterial infections from food poisoning, gingivitis and periodontitis are common and can also have severe neurological sequelae, including meningitis, due to circulating levels of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide/LPS). However, it is not known why infection in some patients progresses to chronic encephalitis and neurodegeneration, whereas other patients recover. It is thought that a background of exposure to heavy metals such as Mn may elevate the risk for more severe neuroinflammatory responses to infection due to increased activation of the inflammatory transcription factor, NF-?B. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that juvenile exposure to Mn potentiates susceptibility to neuroinflammation caused by endotoxin exposures later due to NF-?B- dependent signaling in glial cells that promotes neurodegeneneration and neurological dysfunction in the basal ganglia and other affected brain regions. The following specific aims will test this hypothesis: Specific Aim 1- Determine the role of NF-?B in modulating the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative effects of Mn and LPS during development and aging. ; Specific Aim 2- Determine cellular interactions between astrocytes and microglia that potentiate the effects of Mn and LPS on NF-?B-dependent inflammatory signaling and neuronal injury. Achieving the goals of these aims will help to identify environmental exposures, such as heavy metals found in diet and bacterial infection. This would enable effective preventative measures for such progressive and incurable disorders."
"9455008","PAN-OMICs TECHNOLOGY CORE SUMMARY The objective of the Pan-OMICs Technology Core (PTC) is to provide state-of-the-art, innovative -OMICs technologies for the targeted and global characterization of Project samples in a quantitative, reproducible, and efficient manner. The PTC brings together cutting-edge tools and the expertise of leading systems biologists in three critical areas: (1) Genomics led by Dr. Chris Benner at the University of California, San Diego; (2) Proteomics led by Dr. Nevan Krogan at the J. David Gladstone Institutes; and (3) Metabolomics led by Drs. Ed Dennis and Oswald Quehenberger at the University of California, San Diego (lipidomics) as well as by Dr. Leah Shriver at the University of Akron (polar metabolites). The PTC will be responsible for receiving, processing, and analyzing both in vivo samples from infected patients and mice (Project 1) as well as ex vivo infected samples in culture (Project 2). These data will be integrated by the Modeling Core to identify key drivers of influenza virus infection, biomarkers of disease severity, and potential nodes for therapeutic intervention. Upon perturbation of these critical drivers by each respective Project, the PTC will provide these same services in a comparative manner to determine specific, functional consequences of such perturbations for the determination of molecular mechanism. This iterative cycle from systems-to-mechanism is driven by the Pan-OMICs Technology Core integrating multiple labs and Projects to optimally leverage best-in-class -OMICs approaches to map the molecular pathways surrounding influenza virus infection and disease. The PTC has a uniquely challenging and rewarding directive in the generation and integration of coordinated systems data spanning chromatin modifications and architecture, gene expression, protein abundance, post- translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, lipid profiling, and polar metabolite identification. In the previous iteration of our Fluomics consortium, Drs. Benner, Krogan, Dennis, Quehenberger, and Shriver worked extensively together to tackle these challenges and derive standardized protocols for sample generation, processing, and analysis between different cores and institutes. Formalizing this relationship as a single core under the leadership of Dr. Nevan Krogan, an internationally recognized expert in the design and application of systems biology approaches to interrogate host-pathogen interactions, the PTC is ideally positioned to both effectively and efficiently implement these previously developed pipelines for the accomplishment of our Aims."
"9456459","Abstract  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects 1 out of every 500 African Americans in the US. Characterized by chronic anemia, or low blood hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, patients with SCD also suffer from frequent and acute episodes of pain and fatigue. While current evidence indicates that chronically ill patients who engage in self-management improve their health outcomes, the multi-factorial symptoms of SCD are difficult for the patient to recognize and quantify. Interestingly, the onset of SCD complications are often associated with precipitous worsening of anemia. As such, Dr. Lam?s hematology bioengineering laboratory has recently developed an inexpensive, disposable, patient-operated, color-based, diagnostic that enables pediatric SCD patients to objectively self-monitor their anemia, the hallmark of their disease, and potentially allow them to engage in self-management and hopefully improve their overall clinical outcomes. In addition, the Lam laboratory has also developed an optional smartphone app that enables automated analysis and potential for data transmission. With initial proof-of-concept and clinical assessment studies successfully completed and published, we believe that due to the multifactorial biobehavioral nature of pain and fatigue in SCD, children and adolescents with SCD who self-monitor their anemia with our self-test will better recognize their own levels of pain and fatigue, and be better informed about when to seek appropriate medical care. This, in turn, could lead to reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations and improved clinical outcomes. For this grant, we will first conduct a 3 month home-based usability study in which 20 pediatric and adolescent SCD patients will test these devices on themselves for one month. We will then conduct semi-structured interviews to solicit feedback from these patients, which will inform any modifications we need to make to the biochemistry of the assay, the physical device, and the smartphone app. We will then a conduct a larger study in which 50 SCD pediatric and adolescent patients will be asked to perform anemia self-testing in conjunction with answering pain- and fatigue-related questions the day of their monthly visits and at the onset of any worsening of pain or fatigue symptoms. Specifically, we will answer these questions: 1) Does our anemia self- test provide an additional objective metric that assists pediatric patients in recognizing SCD symptoms that reflect worsening anemia? 2) Does anemia self-testing correlate with SCD pain/fatigue symptoms? 3) Does use of our anemia self-test better inform pediatric SCD patients about when to seek appropriate medical advice/care? At the end of this project, we will have an optimized and validated system that will enable us to conduct larger scale studies to determine whether home anemia self-testing can improve the clinical outcomes for SCD patients and decrease emergency room visits and urgent hospitalizations by detecting acute complications before they become life-threatening."
"9559027","Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious disease killer globally and is largely driven by transmission in high incidence settings. Studies to date, however, have not been able to identify where the majority of transmission is occurring. TB transmission has traditionally been attributed to prolonged, close contact, but numerous studies have shown that only 9?30% of genotypically linked cases can be attributed to close contact. A compelling alternative hypothesis is that the remaining 70% of transmission occurs due to casual contact in the community, but this has never been verified. A better understanding of where transmission occurs will enable the design of more effective interventions to curb TB incidence.  In the Transmission of HIV-Associated XDR TB (TRAX) study in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, we demonstrated that extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB is primarily driven by transmission, rather than acquired resistance, overturning the prevailing belief. However, similar to drug-susceptible TB, less than one-third of drug-resistant TB cases could be linked through close contact. Drug-resistant TB provides a unique opportunity to study transmission due to casual contact, as the limited caseload allows for comprehensive genotyping to identify transmission links between individuals who may name each other in a contact investigation.  In the proposed study, we will test a novel hypothesis that casual contact and migration are fueling TB transmission in high incidence settings. Rising rates of urbanization and migration throughout Asia and Africa have created favorable conditions for TB transmission. Yet, to date, no studies have comprehensively studied how migration may facilitate the spread of TB from urban to rural settings. In Aim 1, we will determine the proportion of XDR TB that develops through casual contact and identify locations where transmission occurs using genomic, social network, and geospatial analyses. In Aim 2, we will characterize migration patterns among persons diagnosed with XDR TB in Durban to determine how migration creates opportunities for XDR TB dissemination. In Aim 3, we will quantify the proportion of XDR TB cases from throughout KwaZulu-Natal province that are genomically linked to cases in Durban using whole genome sequencing.  The aims proposed in the CONTEXT (Casual Contact and Migration in the Transmission of XDR TB) study build upon our established research infrastructure and successful track record of combining state-of-the- art methodologies to gain insight into TB transmission. New knowledge from this study will be essential for informing evidence-based interventions to halt TB transmission and reduce drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB incidence. This will include near real-time data on genomically linked TB cases, as well as the identification of locations that will be highest yield for targeting interventions to decrease airborne transmission. Together, the knowledge and integrated methodology created from this study will catalyze the significant declines in global TB incidence needed to achieve the global EndTB 2035 goals."
"9469781","Project Summary/Abstract Human exposure to tropospheric ozone (O3) is a significant public health concern, with millions of Americans living in areas that exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Acute exposure to O3 causes pulmonary functional decrements and airway inflammation, resulting in significant morbidity in exposed populations. While O3 is a strong oxidizer known to react with a variety of biological molecules, the initiating mechanisms by which it induces inflammation remain unclear. Carbon double bonds in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have widely been recognized as primary targets for O3 attack, leading to formation of free radicals and lipid hydroperoxides. The reactivity of these intermediates with cellular targets is hypothesized to activate pro- inflammatory signaling in human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) exposed to O3. However, dietary supplementation with two omega-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acid, have been shown to confer protection against the adverse health effects of exposure to oxidative air pollution in human volunteers, potentially through their metabolism to anti-inflammatory resolvins, maresins and protectins (SPM). Thus, a paradox may exist between the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids and their role as substrates for the formation of inflammatory lipid hydroperoxides through their reactivity with O3. The goal of this project is to elucidate the role of PUFAs in mediating oxidative and inflammatory responses of HAEC to O3. We hypothesize that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation will modulate the responses of HAEC to O3 exposure. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine the role of lipid hydroperoxide formation in changes to cellular oxidative state during O3 exposure. This will be accomplished through the expression of the genetically-encoded fluorogenic sensor roGFP, which reports the intracellular glutathione redox potential (EGSH) in HAEC in real time. We have previously reported that O3 exposure increases the EGSH in roGFP expressing HAEC. We will then determine the effect of HAEC supplementation with EPA and DHA on O3 induced changes in EGSH. To determine the effect of supplementation on O3 induced inflammation, we will measure the production of both pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-6, and IL-1?, and anti-inflammatory SPMs in EPA or DHA supplemented HAEC following O3 exposure. Finally, we will determine the effect of O3 on mitochondrial bioenergetics, an important influencer of cellular oxidative state, in supplemented HAEC using extracellular flux analyses. Taken together, these experiments will elucidate the mechanism by which O3 induces oxidative and inflammatory changes in HAEC, and determine the role of omega-3 fatty acids in this relationship. A greater understanding of the mechanisms of O3 induced cellular activation will support regulatory efforts, and test the efficacy of using diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids to mitigate morbidity from ozone exposure."
"9524258","PROJECT SUMMARY Membrane fusion, mediated by viral spike glycoproteins, is a key process in the infection cycle of all enveloped human and animal viruses. The overall goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms of Ebola and human immunodeficiency virus entry by membrane fusion, by taking combined state-of-the-art structural and cell biophysical imaging approaches. Although the crystal structures of the ectodomains of several enveloped virus spike glycoproteins have been determined to high resolution and although we and others have contributed NMR structures of the membrane- interactive parts of some of these proteins over the years, we are only beginning to understand the structural transformations that take place when these protein domains interact with membranes and each other, and how these structures drive membrane fusion. In the previous grant period we have made substantial progress towards elucidating the structures of the fusion loop, membrane proximal, and transmembrane domains of the Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein and their pH-dependencies in membrane environments. We have also discovered that HIV particles bind and fuse preferentially at lipid discontinuities in plasma membranes of infected cells and that this process depends critically on the level of membrane cholesterol. Building on these achievements, we now propose to (1) solve the structure of the Ebola virus fusion loop in interaction with its membrane-proximal and transmembrane domain, (2) determine the intracellular factors that trigger Ebola virus fusion in the late endosome, and (3) determine the role of membrane heterogeneity in forming the fusion pore for HIV entry."
"9394792","PROJECT SUMMARY Recent evidence indicates that endothelial cell via angiocrine factors promote tumor growth and metastasis. Understanding how excessive amount of angiocrine factors are produced and how they influence tumor development might unveil novel targets for therapies. Our exciting preliminary data demonstrates Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1), a tumor suppressor gene, regulates Neuropilin (NRP)-1 and VEGF, suggesting that LKB1 may be a central mediator of angiogenesis and tumor growth through its inhibitory function on NRP-1 and VEGF. The central hypothesis of this application is that LKB1 in both ECs and tumor cells down-regulates NRP-1 and other pro-angiogenic factors (PDGF & FGFR) while inhibiting Sp1-induced VEGF transcriptional activation thereby maintaining a state of suppressed angiogenesis and tumor growth. There are three interrelated aims to validate or to refute this hypothesis. Aim 1 is to establish if LKB1 leads to decreased VEGF expression through impeding transcriptional activation hence altering physiological angiogenesis. Aim 2 is to establish if LKB1 suppresses NRP-1 and other non-VEGF growth factors-mediated angiogenesis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the contribution of LKB1 down-regulation of VEGF and NRP-1 within the vascular niche in vivo. We fully anticipate the completion of this project will help define the molecular mechanism by which LKB1 suppresses transcriptional expression and activity of VEGF, NRP-1, and other pro-angiogenic factors (FGFR & PDGFR) within the vascular niche resulting in a reduction in tumor growth and ischemic angiogenesis."
"9397987","Nearly 20% of US troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts are estimated to have suffered probable traumatic brain injury (TBI). Among survivors, the loss of circulating levels of testosterone (hypogonadism) is one of the most frequently reported deficits, and the long-term effects may dramatically increase the risk of multiple symptoms including PTSD, depression, anxiety, and cognitive loss. The ?4 allele of apolipoprotein E is the strongest risk factor for developing Alzheimer?s disease and is also associated with a more severe outcome following TBI. Importantly, individuals who carry APOE4 are 10X more likely to develop AD compared to those without the allele. Given that both TBI and testosterone loss adversely impact neurophysiology, the purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that APOE genotype and testosterone interact to increase the risk of brain injury and that hormone replacement may significantly improve outcome. We have developed a closed-head model of mild traumatic brain injury that simulates acceleration-deceleration of the head during a collision and produces immediate loss of consciousness, temporary motor deficits, and deficits in both spatial and non- spatial learning that persist for at least 1-3 months following injury. These cognitive deficits are genotype and testosterone level dependent at this time point. For this study, we will use human APOE targeted replacement mice, a mouse model that expresses human apoE proteins under endogenous control of the mouse promoter, to assess the effects of APOE genotype in the presence and absence of testosterone loss on outcomes following mild repetitive traumatic brain injury. Specifically, following repeated mild TBI, we will examine the relationship of APOE genotype and testosterone loss on 1) cognitive and behavioral function, as well as 2) synaptic structure and function. Finally we will investigate whether testosterone mediates brain function via inflammatory pathways in an APOE-dependent manner following TBI. Outcomes will be measured 3 and 15 months post-injury in sham and post-TBI gonadectomized mice in order to examine chronic effects during adulthood and the aging process. We will also assess the effects of hormone replacement on behavioral and physiological outcomes. As there are currently no effective treatments that improve outcome following TBI, hormone replacement may provide a potential therapeutic option to attenuate the onset of mental and cognitive disorders that result from hypogonadism, especially in veterans who are genetically at risk. By studying TBI, testosterone, and APOE in conjunction, we can investigate the possibility of personalizing treatments to patients based on their genetic profile, with the goal of minimizing risks and maximizing benefits."
