"9449465","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal structural and functional connectivity (interaction between brain regions) is central to the pathophysiology of psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder. Modern neuroimaging techniques and analytic strategies provide an unprecedented capacity to more fully characterize the functional and structural psychotic disconnectivity. Individuals with psychotic illness and their unaffected relatives have abnormal connectivity, suggesting that at least a portion of psychotic disconnectivity is associated with genetic predisposition for the diseases. Imaging-based connectivity endophenotypes are ideally suited to aid the functional characterization of putative risk genes, allowing us to move beyond a genotype-phenotype association to delineating mechanisms that give rise to psychotic illnesses. Recently, large-scale exome sequencing in individuals of European ancestry provided the strongest evidence to date for specific genetic variants that increase risk for psychosis. These primarily rare mutations were spread across gene networks involved in neuronal processes, including calcium channels and postsynaptic signaling. Our goals are to replicate these promising genetic findings in a different ethnic group, African-Americans, and determine whether and how these gene sets impact psychotic disconnectivity. African-Americans, an underserved population, have ~32% more highly deleterious non-synonymous rare variants in these networks than individuals of European ancestry, improving our power to detect rare variants. Our aims are to: (1) use modern MRI acquisition and analysis techniques based on the Human Connectome Project to document psychotic disconnectivity in 750 African Americans (375 with a psychotic disorder and 375 demographically matched comparison subjects). We will test hypotheses that diagnostic and dimensional indices of psychosis are associated with reduced global functional connectivity but intact global structural connectivity, combined with aberrant connectivity between specific regions or tracts; (2) conduct whole exome sequencing (WES) to test the influence of rare non-synonymous variants from genes in previously identified gene sets on psychosis risk using a network-centered analysis strategy. We will test hypotheses that the voltage-gated calcium ion channel, and the ARC-associated scaffold protein and the NMDAR postsynaptic signaling complexes influence diagnostic and dimensional indices of psychosis; and (3) apply this same network-centric test to determine if gene sets implicated in illness risk also influence functional and structural psychotic disconnectivity. Linking these genetic pathways to psychotic disconnectivity will provide mechanistic insights into the genomic influences on psychotic illness. Our collaborative application includes sites at Yale/Hartford Hospital (DC Glahn PI), Stanford (RA Poldrack PI) and Texas Biomedical Research Institute (J Blangero PI). Our results should bolster our understanding of the genetic architecture of psychotic illness and provide important clues for traversing the chasm between identified genetic networks and the behaviorally defined disorder."
"9432560","Project Summary Abstract This pilot application responds to NIMH Pilot Research on Services for Transition-Age Youth? (R34) by developing and testing an integrated intervention to increase neurocognitive and social cognitive skills to improve functioning and postsecondary outcomes for transition-age students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Our innovative community-based High School SUCCESS (Supported, Comprehensive Cognitive Enhancement and Social Skills) intervention will be delivered within educational settings: high schools and transition programs, to develop the executive functioning and social cognition skills referred to as ?soft skills? that are instrumental in life success. This study has the potential to make a significant public health impact by developing an evidence-based intervention for transition-age youth (TAY) with ASD delivered in real-world services to promote a successful adult life. It also has the potential of advancing the field in neurobehavioral science by measuring cognitive skills as initial behavioral change targets, exploring the relationship and impact cognitions have on functional behaviors that contribute to educational and vocational attainment and overall well-being. With over 50,000 students with ASD exiting the educational system each year and up to 50% without employment and 70% without postsecondary education in adulthood there is a strong need for evidence-based interventions for the transition period. The passage of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA, 2014), has increased the priority of services to transition-age youth with disabilities and now many states have established interagency collaboratives to enhance transition supports and linkages to postsecondary services leading to a more seamless move from the youth entitlement system to the adult qualification system. By utilizing research-community partnership methods, we have worked in collaboration with the community through our partnership of researchers, providers, educators and consumers, Active Collaborative Hub for Individuals with ASD to Enhance Vocation and Education (ACHIEVE) group, to develop a cognitive training intervention for adults with ASD that adapted evidenced -based interventions for schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury. We propose to adapt this adult program for TAY through 3 specific aims: (1) Conduct a Context Assessment to characterize the High School and Transition Programs across districts to understand the variability in program level (services/curriculums, staffing, training, setting) and student level (demographics, functioning) and identify facilitators and barriers to intervention implementation to inform the intervention development and research plan; (2) With our ACHIEVE partners, develop the High School SUCCESS program to fit the needs of transition-age youth with ASD within the community educational system; (3) Conduct a pilot study (n=12 school sites & n=60 students) to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation procedures (recruitment, randomization, retention & training strategies) of High School SUCCESS and to obtain estimates of effects to support a future large-scale effectiveness trial."

"9418644","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the existence of a government-led HIV prevention program focused on men who have sex with men and transgender women (MSM/TW) for nearly two decades in Peru, HIV incidence among them remains high at 5%, and most (70-75%) HIV+ MSM/TW are unaware of their HIV status. This is similar to the rest of Latin America, where sexual transmission among MSM/TW drives the HIV epidemic. HIV prevention efforts for MSM/TW in Peru are ineffective, in part, because this population remains exposed to high levels of societal discrimination, homophobia and transphobia, because of social norms favoring silence about HIV and sexual risk, and because of lack of cultural competent health services. Moreover, HIV+ MSM/TW face substantial HIV stigma, which affects disclosure of HIV status, willingness to obtain HIV testing and care, and social support. A multilevel intervention approach is needed that addresses factors at the individual, social/community, and health system levels, to facilitate earlier detection of HIV infection; linking, retaining, and re-engagin HIV+ people in care and treatment to achieve viral suppression; sexual risk reduction among both HIV- and HIV+ people; and community mobilization around these issues to provide support for and change social norms and engagement in HIV prevention and treatment. A multilevel approach stressing prevention-care links in the Continuum of Prevention and Care (CPC), is likely to reduce barriers to HIV prevention and care through integrated activities involving both community and health facilities, while creating synergy across the intervention elements. We have developed and piloted Proyecto Orgullo (PO), a multilevel, theory-based intervention that diffuses support for and creates positive social norms around HIV prevention by building a mobilized, empowered MSM/TW community to reduce unsafe sex and promote biannual HIV testing. PO has shown to be acceptable, feasible and potentially effective. In collaboration with the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MoH) and local healthcare facilities, we now propose to develop, implement and test the efficacy of PO+, an extension of PO that will facilitate full engagement in the CPC, and strengthen the linkage between the community and the health system. If shown effective, PO+ can be scaled up throughout Peru with the support of the MoH, and used as a model elsewhere in the Americas, including the US.  The project aims are: (1) to create Proyecto Orgullo+ (PO+), a comprehensive, integrated, multilevel intervention that will focus on the CPC; (2) to implement PO+ for 3 years in Lima South, in collaboration with the Peruvian MoH, hospitals that provide HIV care, and HIV testing sites; (3) to evaluate the efficacy of PO+ in affecting the CPC by using: (a) data on the CPC, including sexual risk behavior, HIV testing frequency; incidence of anal Chlamydia and gonorrhea, and engagement in care among HIV+ people, collected through longitudinal cohorts of MSM/TW in Lima South and Lima East (the control area), recruited independently of the intervention, oversampling HIV+ MSM/TW; and (b) CD4 and VL data for HIV patients, collected and provided by the MoH."
"9413368","This is an application from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine to participate in the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network (HF-CRN) as a regional clinical center (RCC) and as a Clinical Research Skills Development Core. Our Mid-Atlantic RCC includes Johns Hopkins University and the Lancaster Heart Group. As a composite, our sites follow a demographically diverse population of more than 6,000 patients with heart failure (HF), with more than 1,900 new referrals, 18,000 outpatient visits and 2,900 HF hospitalizations annually. The size and diversity of the existing HF patient population and referral base served by our sites will enable our RCC to identify and enroll patients in virtually any type of HF clinical research study. With this application, we propose a novel clinical trial examining the therapeutic efficacy of recombinant glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) in patients with severe systolic HF. Recognizing that recent studies demonstrate a 30% rate of death or re-hospitalization and the failure of multiple in-hospital interventions, our study couples the logistical advantages of in-hospital enrollment with the need for a post- hospitalization intervention. The therapeutic promise of GLP-1 is based on the hypothesis that the failing heart is challenged bioenergetically and date indicating that myocardial insulin resistance is high among both diabetics and non-diabetics with severe systolic HF. Small published studies demonstrating that GLP-1 improves myocardial performance and outcomes in patients with systolic dysfunction associated with chronic heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and coronary bypass grafting further support the safety and potential efficacy of GLP-1. Each of these trials was led by Dr. Richard Shannon, the Chairman of Medicine at Penn, who will serve as a consultant for this application. In 360 randomized patients, the proposed study will examine the effect of GLP-1 on the primary endpoint of death or recurrent hospitalization and several secondary endpoints including myocardial contractile reserve assessed via dobutamine stress echocardiography, 6-minute walk distance, quality of life. This novel study of GLP-1 in a high risk population is well-suited to the organization and strength of the HF-CRN."
"9559646","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Our ability to regulate our impulses enables us to plan for the future, to maintain our focus in th face of distractions, and to manage our emotions. Failures of self-regulation are an important component of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and co-occurring disorders, including substance abuse and PTSD. Because of the importance of self-regulation in our daily lives, impairments have profound effects on the lives of Veterans with mTBI, who complain of poor decision making, diminished concentration, and difficult-to-control emotions. Due to barriers to care including the severity of these symptoms, the remoteness of their homes, and concerns about disclosing the extent of their deficits, many of these Veterans are poorly able to participate in counseling and cognitive rehabilitation to address these issues. In such circumstances, effective adjunctive medications to improve self-regulation are important to reinforce the ability of these Veterans to manage their symptoms and to engage in behavioral therapies. Unfortunately, very few medications are effective for cognitive issues in patients with mTBI, and current agents are not effective for many symptoms and for many Veterans.  The purpose of this application is to develop adjunctive medication options for the treatment of impaired self-regulation. To this end, we will use functional MRI to identify relevant brain networks, and a medication, tolcapone, that our preliminary data suggests will improve brain function. Specifically, self-regulatory deficits ae thought to emerge from failures of top- down control - i.e. the ability of higher-order goals to constrain impulses, habits, and other more stimulus-driven responses. Convergent data from multiple fields argue that top-down control in the brain is reflected in the ability of prefrontal cortex to influence activity in other brain regions. Given the clear need for new therapeutic approaches to self-regulatory impairments, this mapping from brain to behavior identifies a potential biomarker for self-regulatory failure, and points toward a strategy for developing treatments. As we detail in our study, both our work and other reports suggest that tolcapone may improve the ability of prefrontal cortex to influence other brain areas by increasing the amount of dopamine in the frontal cortex. Thus, we propose to directly test the hypotheses that self-regulatory deficits in Veterans with mTBI result from diminished top-down control, and that administration of tolcapone will improve self-regulation. We will employ three clinically-relevant tasks within a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled translational functional MRI study to address behavioral, cognitive, and emotional self-regulation, respectively: a financial decision-making task that balances short-term and long-term goals, an attentional task that requires subjects to pay attention to some objects but not to others, and an emotion regulation task that addresses emotion-cognition interactions.  By testing tractable hypotheses, these studies address a critical barrier to progress in the fields of cognitive rehabilitation and psychotherapy. By using brain imaging to evaluate the influence of tolcapone on brain activity related to relevant tasks, we gain insights into mechanism of action that can guide the development of treatments, whether pharmacological or otherwise. This proposal thus represents an innovative, pragmatic approach to a problem - self-regulatory difficulty after mTBI - that is widespread, under-treated, and for which Veterans desperately want new therapies."
"9405907","Composite PROJECT SUMMARY The overriding objective of this proposal for the Duke University Medical Center Regional Clinical Center (Duke RCC) for the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network (HF Network) is to improve the care of patients with heart failure through high-impact patient-oriented clinical research. This objective will be achieved through active collaboration with all components of the HF Network, including other RCCs, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC), associated core labs, and the NHLBI. The overall goal of the HF network is to improve outcomes through optimal application of existing therapies, evaluation of novel therapies, and to facilitate application of emerging basic science discoveries into clinical investigations. We believe the Duke RCC is highly capable of contributing to the successful achievement of these objectives based on a demonstrated record of developing original, innovative, high impact clinical research protocols addressing clinically important research questions in heart failure, and propose a novel protocol targeting acute heart failure patients, the CAPTAIN study, in this application. The Duke RCC has proven ability to recruit scientifically appropriate and ethnically and racially diverse populations of patients into HF Network clinical protocols and provide data that is accurate, complete, timely, and regulatory compliant.

The results of the proposed research will have immediate clinical implications for millions of patients with heart failure."
"9592035","Project Summary CDC recommendations identify MSM in non-monogamous relationships and those in relationships with an HIV positive partner as candidates for PrEP. Estimates suggest as many as 79% of new HIV infections among young MSM (YMSM; ages 18-29) are transmitted between main partners. Drug use is an established correlate of HIV transmission risk. For partnered men, relational factors (e.g., sexual agreements) contextualize drug use and both drug use and sexual agreements predict receptivity to PrEP. Together, these findings point to the need for integrated intervention services ? targeting drug use and sexual health ?tailored for partnered YMSM. Such services are essential to addressing the HIV epidemic in the US. In response, our team has developed a 4-session MI-based intervention targeting PrEP uptake/adherence, HIV TRB, and drug use among partnered YMSM. PARTNER (Prevention And Risk: Treatment with a New Emphasis on Relationships) is delivered to individual YMSM in relationships (not couples), which enhances the scalability of the proposed intervention. Our preliminary pilot work has established the acceptability and feasibility of PARTNER. The primary goal of the current study is to test the efficacy of PARTNER relative to an attention-matched educational control condition used in previously funded NIH studies with HIV-negative YMSM. We propose to recruit 240 HIV-negative partnered YMSM who report recent drug use and sexual behavior consistent with CDC guidance for PrEP candidacy into a randomized control trial. As part of a secondary aim, this project seeks to enhance the range of biological measures for PrEP adherence currently available. The field standard for assessing tenofovir metabolites is dried blood spot assay; however, fingernail assay has high acceptability and lower cost. We propose to validate fingernail samples for PrEP adherence by correlating results obtained from fingernail samples with dried blood spot data. The study team is led by Dr. Tyrel J. Starks (PI), a new investigator with substantial experience in the study of relationship factors associated with sexual health and MSM in relationships. He has collaborated on numerous projects examining the nature of sexual agreements and their association with substance use and HIV transmission risk behavior. He is supported by a study team which includes Dr. Jeffrey Parsons, the PI of multiple intervention studies targeting sexual health and substance use. He is also joined by Dr. Monica Gandhi, an expert in biological assessment for PrEP adherence who has pioneered the use of novel matrices in previous NIH- funded studies. The team brings extensive experience in behavioral intervention research, relationship research, and biomedical assessment."
"9405591","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute Lung Injury (ALI) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Pharmacospecific therapies are not available. Since ALI develops rapidly, fast-acting pharmacospecific therapy is required. We propose that loading lung endothelium with a purified, phosphorylated form of focal adhesion kinase (FAKp), given in non-covalent conjugation with the cell permeable peptide, TAT, will protect against ALI by inducing barrier enhancing protein-protein interactions. Since reported strategies for inhibiting FAK are based on non-specific small molecules that induce non-specific effects, our TAT-FAKp strategy will provide specific understanding of FAK's barrier-strengthening effect. Proposal. To test the hypothesis that activated FAK strengthens the endothelial barrier, a purified, activated form of FAK conjugated with the cell-permeable peptide, TAT, will be loaded in lung endothelia. It is expected that this conjugated constructed, called here TAT-FAKp will induce protein-protein interactions between FAK, paxillin, vinculin and ?-actinin-1 to form a protein complex, called here the FPVA complex, that enhances F- actin at adherens junctions, leading to cadherin clustering and barrier enhancement. This hypothesis will be tested in the context of barrier quantifications in cultured monolayers and animal models of ALI, using strategies for by interfering with FPVA forming protein-protein interactions. These strategies will be (1) inducing point mutations on FAK tyrosine residues, and (2) expressing mutations on the binding domains of the partner proteins of the FPVA complex. Approach. Specific Aims 1 and 2 will evaluate the barrier protective protein-protein interactions induced by TAT-FAKp in endothelial monolayers and mouse lungs. These aims will be achieved through expression of mutants in cultured human lung microvascular, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, and in mouse lungs. In the presence of these mutations, protein-protein interactions and cadherin stability will be determined as reflected by studies of fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching and by assays of endothelial permeability as reflected by the filtration coefficient (Kf), lung water in mice, point permeability assays and the transendothelial resistance (TER), transmigration of leukocytes, in cultured ECs. We will determine protective effects through blinded mouse survival studies. Expected Outcome. Based on supportive preliminary data, we expect to show that loading endothelia with TAT-FAKp will abrogate thrombin or oxidant-induced hyperpermeability in lung endothelial monolayers, and ALI-induced lung hyperpermeability in mice. We expect that mouse survival following ALI will be considerably more extended in TAT-FAKp-treated than in untreated mice. For the first time, the positive therapeutic effects TAT-FAKp will be understood in terms of critical protein-protein interactions induced by activated FAK."

"9471156","Project Summary/Abstract The Global Forum on TB Vaccines (Global Forum) is the world?s largest gathering of researchers, clinicians, product developers, policy makers, advocates, health officials, and other stakeholders striving to develop new effective vaccines to prevent tuberculosis (TB). In 2015, TB killed an estimated 1.8 million people, more than any other single infectious disease agent, and 10.4 million become sick with the disease (1). The United Nation?s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the World Health Organization?s (WHO) End TB Strategy, and the Stop TB Partnership?s Global Plan to End TB 2016-2020 recognize that new vaccines will be essential for reaching global targets to eliminate TB. The Global Forum provides a unique opportunity for the TB vaccine research and development (R&D) community to come together to review the state of the field, share the latest research and findings, and identify new and innovative approaches to TB vaccine R&D, with the end goal of developing new TB vaccines. The Global Forum program topics range from basic research to clinical trials, licensure, access, and advocacy. The 5th Global Forum on TB Vaccines will take place in New Delhi, India from February 20-23, 2018. India?s prominence in research expertise and vaccine manufacturing capabilities, combined with the important role it plays in the global effort to end the TB epidemic, make it a relevant and impactful location to host this important conference. As with past Global Forums, the 5th Global Forum will provide a platform for scientific exchange, opportunities to identify potential partners and collaborators, and a platform for a global discourse on the R&D path towards an effective TB vaccine. The organizers will seek ways to enhance networking and promote interactions amongst participants and to bring together participants with common interests. Additionally, the Forum encourages and supports early-career researchers in sharing their research, and offers multiple opportunities to learn from and engage with experts in the field. Aeras is requesting funding from the NIH to support travel for early-career researchers and participants from TB endemic countries who would not otherwise have the resources to attend, present their research, or participate in the discussions that take place at the Global Forum. The 5th Global Forum will follow on the very successful 4th Global Forum in Shanghai, China (April 2015); 3rd Global Forum in Cape Town, South Africa (March 2013); and 2nd Global Forum in Tallinn, Estonia (September 2010). The first Global Forum on TB Vaccines was organized by the WHO and took place in Geneva in 2001."

Paskett, PhD, MSPH and Mary Ellen Wewers, RN, PHD, MPH, has 52 members from 19 OSU departments within the OSU Colleges of Medicine, Public Health, Arts and Sciences, Law, Nursing, Education and Human Ecology, Dentistry, and Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, as well as Nationwide Children's Hospital and Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Program members provide a wealth of behavioral, basic, clinical, policy, outcomes, and social scientific knowledge and expertise not only to the CC Program, but to the OSUCCC as a whole. The overall CC Program goal is to conduct research to reduce the incidence, mortality and morbidity of cancer, which is accomplished by employing a transdisciplinary research team approach. The Specific Aims of the CC Program are to: 1) Identify molecular, genetic, and behavioral factors related to cancer incidence and mortality; 2) Develop and test behavioral interventions to prevent or detect cancer early; and, 3) Assess and intervene on issues of cancer survivorship. An additional developing aim of the CC Program is to address policy in relation to cancer prevention, detection, and care. Within these aims, research focuses on cross-cutting themes including underserved/minority populations within our catchment area, communication research, tobacco use and toxicity (including regulatory science), and behavioral strategies that capitalize on our members' strengths, such as epidemiology, biology and behavior. The program now has 2 NCI P50-funded Centers, both showcasing not only our multi-level focus but also the transition from observational to interventional studies. In addition, many of our interventions, e.g., Patient Navigation and Bio-Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Stress after Breast Cancer, have been incorporated into clinical care. Moreover, our research has contributed to policy changes, most notably the establishment of a smoke-free campus at OSU. During this past funding period (2009 - 2014), the Program members published a total 611 articles in peer-reviewed journals of which 32% have intra-programmatic collaboration, 20% have inter-programmatic collaborations, and 404 (66%) of the publications represent multi-institutional collaborations. Many of these publications fall within each of these categories bringing the total collaborative publications to 85%. CC Program funding stands at $6.8M of which $6.2M is peer-reviewed funding and of that, $3.9M (63%) is NCI funding. CC Program investigators have enrolled 9,205 participants to research studies over the last 5 years, 64% to externally peer-reviewed studies and 34% to institutional studies, 1.2% to cooperative trial group studies and 0.8% to industry studies. Of these, 6,964 (76%) were enrolled on interventional studies and 2,241 (24%) on non-interventional studies. Future goals focus on increasing research in: 1) policy, allowing us to take advantage of health care policy initiatives; 2) molecular and genetic epidemiology and 3) patient outcomes, fostering more inter-programmatic research with clinicians."
"9481577","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate. Dr. Kathryn Dupnik is an Infectious Disease-trained physician-scientist committed to translational research on mycobacterial diseases. She documented the transcriptome profile of the pathologic immune reactions of leprosy and co-authored 20 peer-reviewed publications on infectious diseases of resource-limited settings. As an investigator with the TB Research Unit, she established the infrastructure for enrollment and monitoring of cohorts for study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Career Development Plan. Dr. Dupnik?s long-term goal is to become an independent physician-scientist conducting translational laboratory research on the host immune response to mycobacterial pathogens. Her short- and long-term objectives are: 1. To gain skills in clinical epidemiology and the conduct of large clinical cohort studies 2. To gain laboratory expertise in the study of human macrophages and M. tuberculosis 3. To acquire skills in bioinformatics and statistical analysis of large transcriptional data sets 4. To transition to independent investigator by preparing a R01 grant and gaining leadership and mentorship skills. Environment. The proposed research and training will be at Weill Cornell Medical College (New York, NY) and at GHESKIO centers (Port-au-Prince, Haiti). These institutions have a 35-year history of collaboration to provide clinical care and conduct patient-oriented research on HIV, which Dr. Dupnik first joined in 2006. Research. This research is an extension of Dr. Dupnik?s prior work on human immune response to mycobacterial infection. TB recurrence risk is well-documented in the study population in Haiti. The aims of this grant are designed to characterize this population at risk and to identify potential patient-oriented therapies. Specific Aim 1. Characterize macrophages from HIV-infected people with history of at least 2 clinical episodes of pulmonary TB. We will study macrophages derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 50 HIV-infected people with history of multiple episodes of TB and compare them to 50 HIV-infected people from the same community who have had one episode of TB without recurrence. The primary hypothesis is that mycobacterial load in macrophages after in vitro M. tuberculosis infection will be higher in people who had TB recurrence. We will compare gene expression in the M. tuberculosis-exposed macrophages. Specific Aim 2. Determine immune correlates for recurrent TB in a prospectively monitored cohort of HIV- infected patients with TB. We will follow 500 HIV-infected patients with TB for 3 years after TB cure, anticipating that 40 patients will have a reinfection with a new strain of M. tuberculosis. The primary hypothesis is that whole blood from these 40 patients will have a transcriptome profile at cure of first TB which is distinct from people who do not develop recurrent TB, which could be used to target secondary prophylaxis. Significance. Patient oriented interventions such as antitubercular therapy or host directed therapies could be implemented once those at highest risk for recurrent TB and the associated mechanisms are identified."
"9405049","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed pre-doctoral training fellowship serves two overarching goals: 1) To enhance my quantitative and qualitative research methods skills toward applying for and obtaining a mixed methods R01grant; and 2) To apply and refine my public health training by conducting a dissertation research project to understand the effect of the changing food environment on obesity in a historically low-socioeconomic status (SES) community of color undergoing gentrification. Background: Since the late 1990s, the neighborhood of Central Harlem in New York City has been undergoing dramatic transformation as characterized by gentrification, a mixture of divestment and redevelopment. These changes influence the food environment (i.e. grocery outlets, restaurants, street vendors, and farmers' markets) and, with it, residents' food-related practices and health. Given the high rates of nutrition-related conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in Harlem, any transformation in its food environment raises the need for investigation. The overarching question of my dissertation is: How does the changing food environment in Harlem, a neighborhood undergoing gentrification, affect residents' risk for obesity mediated by food-related dispositions and practices? Aims: The specific aims are to: 1) Examine changes in Central Harlem's food environment during 1990-2010 by analyzing the NETS database; 2) Examine whether longitudinal changes in the food practices of mothers and children are associated with changes in weight measurements and risk for obesity using the Columbia Center of Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) cohort data; 2a) Compare changes in the weights of mothers and children who have remained in Central Harlem and those who have moved from the neighborhood; 3) Use ethnographic methods (including participant observation, and in-depth interviews with a sub-set of CCCEH participants) and key informant interviews to explore ongoing changes in Harlem's food environment, and how these changes affect food practices and dispositions, thus corroborating and expanding upon the quantitative findings under Aims 1 and 2; and 4) Integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings and thus develop a provisional conceptual framework to understand the effects of gentrification on obesity as mediated by food practices and dispositions. Methods: Consistent with my training objectives, the study will apply an ethnographic and sociological framework of habitus to examine the relationship between gentrification, habitus and obesity prevalence among residents of a historically resource poor neighborhood. Specifically, I will conduct a mixed methods explanatory sequential design including three phases: 1) secondary longitudinal data analyses of the National Establishments Time-Series database and CCCEH mother-child pairs; 2) qualitative data collection and analysis by employing an ethnography of Harlem's food environment and interview with 15- 20 key informants and 45 CCCEH participants; and 3) integration of findings to develop a provisional conceptual framework that illustrates the effect o gentrification on obesity as mediated by food habitus."

Clinton, MD, PhD,  has a collaborative team of 37 basic, translational and clinical scientists. These faculty have appointments in  17 Departments/Divisions within the Colleges of Medicine, Arts and Sciences, Pharmacy, Food Agriculture and  Environmental Sciences, Public Health, Dentistry, Education and Human Ecology and Veterinary Medicine.  The Specific Aims of the MCC Program are: 1) to characterize molecular and cellular changes induced by  chemical, physical, hormonal and infectious agents that contribute to neoplastic transformation and multistage  carcinogenesis in experimental models and humans; 2) to develop and characterize novel agents for cancer  chemoprevention and define their efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action using in vitro and preclinical  models; and 3) to identify dietary and nutritional components that may enhance or inhibit the carcinogenesis  cascade across the continuum of cancer progression. Each of these aims results in translational prevention  studies in human populations with an emphasis on those at risk due to exposure to carcinogenic or cancer  promoting agents, familial and genetic predisposition, or due to the presence of premalignant lesions.  The MCC Program's overarching goals, implemented through multiple MCC initiatives, are to accelerate the  research objectives of each Aim through incentivizing and stimulating collaborative investigation among MCC  members, other investigators of the OSUCCC as well as facilitating the implementation of translational studies  of cancer etiology, prevention, and progression in human trials. The MCC enhances quality by promoting  knowledge of and utilization of state-of-the-art technologies provided by the OSUCCC shared resources  (members utilize 14/14 shared resources).  The MCC Program, during its previous review (2004-2009) was graded as ?Outstanding to Exceptional?.  During this funding period (2009-2014), MCC Program members published 484 cancer relevant peer-reviewed  articles in top tier journals for the respective fields of carcinogenesis, chemoprevention, and nutrition.  Collaboration is extensive with 28% intra-programmatic publications and 55% inter-programmatic publications,  with 272 or 56% being multi-institutional and 447 or 92% being collaborative publications. Peer-reviewed  funding for the MCC Program is $5.19M in annual direct costs with $2.9M (56%) from the NCI. Translational  research has been robust as well with 20 human trials led by MCC members employing the OSUCCC Clinical  Trials Office resulting in 360 interventional accruals during the last funding cycle, 72% of which were from  investigator-initiated Phase I and II trials. The current MCC Program uniquely integrates investigators across  disciplines yet with shared interests focusing upon the interactive themes of carcinogenesis, chemoprevention,  and nutrition. Our future goals include the integration of new initiatives involving the microbiome and  metabolomics, two areas benefiting from rapid growth in technology and bioinformatics that will dramatically  impact our understanding of carcinogenesis and strategies for cancer prevention."

"9390877","PROJECT-005: TRANSLATIONAL THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM (TT)  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The Translational Therapeutics Program at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center  (OSUCCC), led by David Carbone, MD, PhD and Denis Guttridge, PhD, unites an outstanding team of 55  basic, translational and/or clinical researchers from 17 departments within the Colleges of Business, Medicine,  Engineering, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Medicine at Ohio State University. This Program is a continuation of  the 15 year-old Experimental Therapeutics (ET) Program that included both liquid and solid tumors. However,  as the result of a strategic effort to grow the solid tumor presence in the OSUCCC, we successfully recruited  an additional 38 solid tumor physicians, basic scientists, and physician-scientists during this last funding  cycle, 16 of who came into the ET Program. We also transitioned to new leadership in the departments of  radiation oncology and pathology, as well as in the divisions of medical oncology, surgical oncology and  gynecologic oncology, each with expertise in translational medicine and each a member of this Program. With  more emphasis on translation and less emphasis on experimental pharmacology, we renamed the ET Program  ?Translational Therapeutics (TT)?. Under the leadership of Drs. Carbone and Guttridge the TT Program has  seen significant progress during the last cycle, producing 874 peer-reviewed publications among which 9% are  in high impact (>10) journals, 28% from intra-programmatic collaborations, 43% from inter-programmatic  collaborations; 59% are multi-institutional and 86% are collaborative publications. TT Program members have  collaborated on programmatic grant submissions and have been awarded 2 NCI P01s, a U01, a U54 SPORE,  and a U10 programmatic grant focused on solid tumor biology, as well as two T32 training grants. As a  consequence of these and other collaborative efforts, the TT Program has $8.8M in current annual direct costs  from peer-reviewed grants of which $7.3M (83%) is from the NCI. The TT Program is well-integrated with the  clinical teams via participation in the multidisciplinary Disease Specific Research Groups. As such, there were  5,253 accruals to interventional clinical trials during the last funding cycle of which 4,357 (83%) were  therapeutic; 2043 (47%) of the latter resulted from investigator-initiated clinical trials. The overall goal of the  TT Program is to pursue solid tumor biology in order to develop and translate promising preclinical studies into  innovative clinical trials for the successful prevention, diagnosis and treatment of solid tumors. This goal will be  achieved by performing the following specific aims: 1) Identifying alterations in solid tumor signaling pathways  to develop targeted therapeutics; 2) Identifying and therapeutically targeting tumor-host interactions; and 3)  Improving upon or developing new approaches for determining prognosis, selecting appropriate therapy and  evaluating the response to treatment. Future directions include continued strategic recruitments and heavy  leveraging of the OSUCCC's Drug Development Institute (DDI) to move a number of our exciting compounds  in the TT Program into the clinic for a variety of solid tumors."
"9621133","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All neurodegenerative diseases (NDG) display mitochondrial dysfunction and this can lead to activation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) either through a reduced cellular AMP/ATP ratio or via the production of reactive oxygen species. Active AMPK re-wires cellular metabolism by inhibiting catabolic and stimulating anabolic processes. While intuitively activated AMPK ought to be healthful for neurons, in several NDG models AMPK activation has been shown to be noxious to neurons. This proposal aims to identify the mechanism by which activated AMPK in neurons is injurious in cellular models of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Neurons expressing mutant SOD or TDP43 (to model ALS) have enhanced glycolysis as a function of AMPK activation. Experiments in Specific Aim #1 test the hypothesis that by diverting glycolytic substrates away from the hexosamine biosynthetic and the pentose phosphate pathways - key pathways for maintaining healthy redox state and suppressing the unfolded protein response - activated AMPK is noxious to neurons. To translate these observations into a potential therapy for ALS patients we need to be able to manipulate glycolysis in neurons specifically - since inhibition of glycolysis in glial cells could have adverse effects. In Specific Aim #2, we will use genetically modified mice to isolate ribosomes from neurons and glial cells separately and interrogate the associated mRNA for cell type specific variants of glycolytic enzymes. Rewiring metabolism in the setting of toxic proteins may be reporter for a subgroup of ALS patients that could respond to metabolism-targeted intervention. In Specific Aim #3, we will determine the prevalence of metabolic re-wiring in fibroblasts re-programmed into neurons from ALS patients and controls. Understanding the neuron-specific adaptation to metabolic stress in NDG has the potential to uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9548769","The limbs of tetrapod vertebrates are composed of four basic segments: the limb, forelimb, wrist/ankle, and hand/foot. The identity of these segments is determined during limb formation by specific combinations of Hox genes. As the limb bud grows away from the main body axis, two waves of Hoxd gene expression occur. The first wave specifies the limb and forelimb. Then, following a short period of low Hoxd expression, a second wave of expression specifies the hand and foot portions. Cells that are produced during the transient step between these waves will form the wrist and ankle. Remarkably, these two phases of expression result from topological changes within the HoxD gene cluster and flanking regulatory domains. During formation of the arm and forearm, enhancers in the telomeric regulatory domain (T-DOM) drive the first collinear wave of expression. Then in proliferating distal limb bud cells, the T-DOM is inactivated, followed shortly by activation of the centromeric regulatory domain enhancers (C-DOM), driving the second wave of Hoxd expression and formation of the hand. The HoxA transcription factor HOXA13 is essential to this transition, acting to repress T-DOM and then activating C-DOM. The goal of the work proposed here is to understand how changes in enhancer status drive the topological transition between the two waves of Hoxd expression. To do this, we will perform two key experiments to challenge the conversion of each regulatory domain from active to inactive, or vice-versa. Specifically, we will first disrupt the activation of C-DOM by deleting an important autopod (hand/foot) enhancer called II-1. Our preliminary data indicates that HOXA13 acts through II-1 to drive the second wave of Hoxd expression. We will then target a copy of this enhancer into T-DOM, providing HOXA13 with an enhancer element that it normally acts through to activate C-DOM, but now within the chromatin context of T-DOM, which is being silenced in the same cells. We will evaluate changes in the chromatin state induced by these genetic perturbations by monitoring chromatin modifications via histone ChIP-Seq (H3K27me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27Ac) and ATAC-Seq. We will monitor for changes in gene expression quantity by RNA-Seq, and changes in the location of expression by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Furthermore, because we expect these mutations to induce large-scale changes in chromatin topology and possibly force continued activity from native T-DOM enhancers, we will utilize Capture Hi-C to monitor changes in HoxD topology. One prediction from these experiments is that each modified regulatory domain will resist complete conversion from one state to the other, due to the influence of this enhancer, with significant changes in chromosomal topology and gene expression. This experimental approach mirrors some natural mutations in chromatin structure that influence human development and health. Together these experiments will shed light on the molecular mechanisms of limb patterning, developmental gene regulation, and the influence of enhancers on genome topology."
"9525622","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     In recent war-related conflicts, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a signature injury affecting a large percentage of the Veteran population. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, also referred to as concussion) accounts for approximately 70-80% of all TBI among returning Veterans as well as the civilian population. Although most overt symptoms of mTBI resolve spontaneously within days or weeks of the injury, in 10-20% of mTBI victims some functional deficits persist, with recent estimates suggesting that as many as 44-50% of mTBI patients experience three or more symptoms at one-year post-injury. Repetitive mTBI is of particular interest because military personnel often have several mTBI exposures over the course of their lives and possibly within single deployments. Recurrent brain injuries, even when mild, may interfere with neuropsychological recovery. Repeated concussion has also been associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disorder with progressive impairments of memory and cognition, as well as depression, anxiety, and motor abnormalities.  Among the proposed environmental risk factors of neurodegenerative disease, TBI, including mild TBI, is probably one of the most consistent candidates for initiating the molecular cascades and provoking neurodegeneration leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Consequently TBI has been shown to accelerate pathology and behavioral deficits in genetic models of AD or to enhance vulnerability to Parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxins. Recent evidence also identified TBI as an environmental risk factor of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), an early onset dementia associated in its behavioral variant with behavioral abnormalities, loss of sociability, or impulsive and irrational behavior.  Our preliminary studies show that mild repetitive impacts to the head of mice using a controlled impactor (closed head injury) result in gliosis, white matter changes, and cognitive deficits 3 months after injury. Separately, we showed that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), a key growth factor in the hematopoietic system, has prominent neuroprotective effects in acute brain injury when administered systemically after injury. These effects are mediated via CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) expressed at least in part by injured neurons. A newly discovered second ligand for this receptor, IL-34, seems to be equally or more potent than CSF1 in our model. Most importantly, for this proposal, preliminary studies show a remarkable recovery of memory impairment and reduced gliosis with a single bolus treatment of CSF1 after injury in our model of mTBI.  Based on these preliminary data we hypothesize that mild traumatic insults to the central nervous system lead to long-term neurobehavioral deficits in mice which model in part the deficits observed in human mTBI patients, and that systemic treatment with CSF1 and IL-34 will attenuate brain injury and related behavioral deficits even if given days or weeks after injury. In this application we propose to refine our model of mTBI and assess long-term pathological and cognitive changes in wildtype mice. We will expose mice to multiple repetitive cortical impacts that are days or weeks apart and study the longterm consequences of these injuries. Most importantly, we will treat such impaired mice with neuroregenerative protein therapies days, weeks or months after the initial traumatic impact occurred. After completion of the proposed studies we expect to have preclinical proof for efficacy of CSF1 and/or IL-34 in reducing pathology and alleviating symptoms in mouse models of mTBI. Since CSF1 is used clinically in humans our findings may find rapid translation to the clinic."
"9604448","SUMMARY  Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) cause a severe inflammatory diarrhea and infect an estimated 100 million patients per year, of which 1.4 million are in the United States. Although the early inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa is critical to control NTS infection and confine it to the gut, recent studies conducted by our group and others have shown that elements of intestinal inflammation are exploited by NTS to thrive in the inflamed gut and to transmit to nave hosts. Multiple mechanisms - many of which are still unknown - play a role in this process. In this regard, we found that sequestration of essential metal ions, a process known as ?nutritional immunity?, is an arm of the host response that is exploited by NTS to thrive in the inflamed gut and to compete with the intestinal microbiota. The primary objective of this application is to continue to elucidate the mechanisms by which NTS thrive in the inflamed intestinal mucosa, evade the host's nutritional immune response, and compete with the resident microbiota for metal nutrients. Our central hypothesis is that NTS exploits nutritional immunity to outcompete the microbiota for the essential metal micronutrients iron, zinc, and manganese. The inflamed gut is a hostile environment where metal ion deprivation enhances the proliferation of pathogens like NTS that can efficiently acquire metal ions. We reason that understanding how NTS exploits nutritional immunity to its own advantage will lead to new approaches to limit the replication of NTS in the inflamed gut and to impede its transmission to other hosts. The proposed work is innovative because it establishes new concepts on how a pathogen can exploit host mucosal defenses. It is our expectation that the outcome of this study will identify mechanisms by which NTS, and likely other pathogens or pathobionts, exploits nutritional immunity to thrive in the inflamed gut, potentially leading to new therapies and vaccines to target metal ion acquisition by the pathogen."
"9403218","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse remodeling of the myocardium after myocardial infarction speeds progression to heart failure. Some of the major shortcomings in cell therapy are the growth and differentiation of implanted cells. In patients, cells are injectedto an area comprised mostly of noncontractile collagen, far different from their native microenvironment. This study aims to determine whether a biodegradable, modular hydrogel can be used to implant cells and direct their behavior. Dr. Andres Garcia has developed a biocompatible, injectable, smart delivery system based on polyethylene glycol. This material forms a stable hydrogel and degrades as matrix metalloproteases are released. Our preliminary data suggest that adult c-kit positive cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) currently in human clinical trials, migrate into hydrogels containing growth factors, but the numbers of these cells in vivo is not known. Preliminary data from that Davis laboratory suggests that these cells express the Notch receptor and respond to Jagged- induced activation by increasing differentiation. In a separate system, a Notch-activating peptide termed JAG-1 has been immobilized and CPCs cultured within demonstrate increased expression of cardiac, endothelial, and smooth muscle genes. Completion of the proposed studies will demonstrate a potential role for PEG hydrogel- mediated delivery of CPCs to the post-infarct myocardium for the purpose of enhancing implanted progenitor cell therapy."
"9412185","The problem. The last decade has seen unprecedented progress in understanding the immune processes that drive atherosclerotic lesion initiation, maturation and complication. In particular, macrophages emerged as key cells that promote disease progression. If the number of inflammatory macrophages in plaque increases, atherosclerosis advances towards life-threatening complications. Plaque macrophages derive from circulating monocytes, which in turn arise from myeloid progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells. When released into circulation, monocytes follow chemokine gradients towards atherosclerotic plaque, where endothelial adhesion molecules aid their extravasation into the vessel wall. Once in plaque, inflammatory macrophages destabilize matrix via proteases and may die locally. Alternatively, if the local environment permits, macrophages may obtain less inflammatory phenotypes promoting cholesterol removal and tissue repair. These insights have been difficult to translate into clinically useful therapeutics, partly because broad anti-inflammatory therapy may compromise beneficial functions of immune cells and host defense. The goal. In this application, we aim to create a new class of macrophage-targeted atherosclerosis therapeutics using in vivo RNA interference (RNAi). We will design small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting discrete proteins which are key decision nodes for macrophages' fate. We propose to interfere with the life cycle of macrophages with the goal to support inflammation resolution in atherosclerotic plaque. We will test the central hypothesis that RNAi can be harnessed to design precision therapeutics for inflammatory atherosclerosis. We will test this hypothesis by targeting proteins that are essential for macrophage birth (silencing transcription factors MTG16 and PU.1 that influence activity of hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial targets in the hematopoietic niche), migration (silencing chemokine receptors in monocytes and adhesion molecules in endothelial cells), maturation (silencing the M-CSF receptor essential for differentiation of monocytes into macrophages) and polarization (silencing the essential transcription factor IRF5 that gives rise to M1 macrophages with inflammatory functions). Innovation. We will use new nanomaterials for delivery to myeloid, progenitor and endothelial cells, newly and yet-to-be identified siRNA sequences, and target innovative biological targets important in the macrophage life cycle. Impact. We will develop new therapeutics to dampen inflammatory macrophage activity in the arterial wall. We will identify a winning therapeutic strategy in mice with post-MI acceleration of atherosclerosis, a scenario that simulates the vulnerable patient in need of aggressive therapeutic intervention. Our ultimate goal is to bring these materials into the clinic, improving the currently insufficient standard of care by enabling better secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke."
"9617496","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prognosis of Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains poor because of frequent treatment failure and rapid relapse. ALL cells are significantly protected against drug treatment by stromal cells in their microenvironment, but the molecular signals that mediate the protection are not well-defined. All cells, and in particula cells of the immune system, are covered by a dense layer of carbohydrate-modified proteins and glycolipids, of which the function has not been explored. However, the first step in the communication between ALL cells and the stroma takes place through cell surface structures, of which carbohydrates are likely to play key roles. Our preliminary data show that the polyLacNAC-binding lectin Galectin-3 (Gal3) is part of the microenvironment created by stromal cells and identify extracellular Gal3 as a communication molecule between ALL cells and the stroma that protects ALL cells against drug treatment. We hypothesize that Gal3 in the ALL microenvironment is a molecular communicator that promotes Ph-positive ALL cell survival through extracellular lattice formation of glycosylated cell surface proteins and intracellularly b interactions with Bcr/Abl. Corollaries of this hypothesis are: Removal of Galectin-3 will 1) interrupt an important signal between these cell types and 2) will generate ALL cells that are more sensitive to drug treatment. The following Aims, with independent experiments that will be studied concurrently, will test these predictions: Aim 1 will determine the extracellular component of the signal by identification of the cell surface ligands/binding partners of Gal3 on Ph-positive ALL cells using different complementary approaches. Aim 2 will investigate the intracellular component of the signal by examining molecular interactions between Bcr/Abl and Gal3 and their effects on ALL cell survival. Aim 3 will determine the significance of extracellular and intracellular Gal3 to pre-B ALL cell function both in vitro, by comparing gene expression in gal3-/- and gal3+/+ pre-B ALL cells, in these cells stimulated with exogenous Gal3, and treated with nilotinib and in vivo through transplant of gal3-/- and gal3+/+ pre-B ALL cells into gal3 -/- and +/+ recipients and comparing homing, proliferation and the effect of vincristine and nilotinib treatment. These experiments together will be the first to fully characterize the significance of Gal3 in any type of cancer, and specifically will tease apart the function of this carbohydrate-binding protein in its extracellular location as communication messenger between stroma and ALL cells and in its intracellular location as an anti-apoptotic molecule."
"9426329","Project Summary Meiotic chromosome segregation is essential for gamete formation in all sexually reproducing organisms, including humans. Prior to segregation, homologous chromosomes (homologs) undergo pairing and recombination giving rise to crossovers. Crossovers provide physical connections that mediate bipolar homolog segregation. Without crossovers, gametes with unbalanced chromosome content form, a condition associated with birth defects and sterility. Crossovers are formed by induction of double strand breaks (DSBs) at multiple chromosome positions. The principal investigator?s long term goal is to understand the functional integration of meiotic chromosome structure, and recombination. The current proposal aims to identify the role of the 26S proteasome along meiotic chromosomes. We have recently discovered that the 26S proteasome is recruited in an evolutionarily conserved manner to meiotic chromosomes where it is required for pairing of homologous chromosomes and recombination. The proteasome is the main site of protein degradation in all eukaryotes. It is a multicomponent, compartmentalized protease that resides both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. While cytoplasmic proteasome functions in eliminating misfolded and short-lived, regulatory proteins have been recognized for a long time, functions of the proteasome in the nucleus are much less understood. Using a combination of microscopy, genetic and proteomic approaches, we will pursue the following aims: First, we will use tightly controlled conditional alleles to systematically characterize the contribution of the proteasome to distinct meiotic functions. Second, we will identify degradation substrates of the proteasome relevant for chromosome pairing and recombination, thereby providing insights into a novel class of molecules that coordinate the meiotic program by preventing precocious progression of a subset of chromosomal events. Meiotic chromosome segregation defects in absence of a functional proteasome emphasize the importance of an improved understanding of this process. We will determine the overall composition of the proteasome and factors that control its localization to distinct positions along meiotic chromosomes. These studies provide a unique opportunity to determine to what extent proteolytic core and potentially alternative regulatory proteasome particles cooperate along meiotic chromosomes. This analysis of proteasome functions in recombination and homolog pairing will pave the way towards a better understanding how chromosome- associated proteolysis is used in living cells, and how interference with proteasome function, e.g. in cancer therapy, can impact fertility and reproductive health."

The mechanisms underlying the development of immunity to malaria remain poorly understood. Dr. Dobbs will study regulation of monocyte functions in Kenyan children during acute uncomplicated malaria and 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months following treatment using samples collected as part of larger prospective observational cohort studies in western Kenya. This project will focus on changes in the monocyte epigenome that underlie changes in monocyte function during acute malaria in children (Aim 1) and on the molecular mechanisms that lead to impaired monocyte phagocytic function during acute malaria (Aim 2). In Aim 1, Dr. Dobbs will analyze the epigenetic landscape of monocytes from children during acute malaria compared to 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months following treatment and compared to age-matched healthy controls. In Aim 2, Dr. Dobbs will determine the mechanisms responsible for impaired monocyte phagocytosis by analyzing gene and cell surface expression of activating vs. inhibitory receptors (and their downstream signaling pathways) in monocytes from children during acute malaria and 6 weeks after treatment. This research will form the basis of a prospective observational cohort study on innate immune training and human malaria pathogenesis that will be proposed in an R01 application in the final year of the K23 award."

The three Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies and application to an urgent systems neuroscience question. AIM 1 develops the surgical methodology, electrode localization strategies and custom skeletal implants for to distribute robotic patch clamping electrodes to the requisite targets in the cortex. AIM 2 develops the parallel patch-clamp robot itself as well as the algorithms to control dense arrays of intracellular recording electrodes. AIM 3 will utilize the functionally characterized platform to obtain parallel whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in behaving mice within and across different lamina and circuits in a cortical association area. This project is well suited to the goals of bioengineering research program ? we are using a multidisciplinary approach to develop a robotic platform that removes a critical barrier for studying neuronal circuit functioning with a high degree of cell and circuit specificity during behavior. The successful development of this technology platform will empower neuroscientists to map the activities of neurons in specific circuits throughout the nervous system, enabling a mechanistic understanding of how circuits function in behaviors, and reveal how cells and circuits go awry in pathological states."
"9412757","Project Summary  The insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS) pathway is highly conserved among animals and is essential for proper metabolism, development, and reproduction. However, IIS activity is also paradoxically variable, resulting in species-specific differences, including body size and fecundity. In humans, IIS heterogeneity may also predispose individuals to certain diseases and disorders. Therefore, an understanding of the broad consequences of differential IIS and its underlying genetic mechanisms will provide insight into development, oogenesis, and disease susceptibility. In Drosophila, IIS is highly divergent between species and, in D. melanogaster and D. sechellia, has been shown to influence fecundity by affecting the number of ovarioles. Utilizing the enormous genetic toolset in the Drosophila ovary, I aim to determine the significance of differential IIS as it pertains to ovariole development in D. melanogaster and D. sechellia. In Aim 1, I will determine the biological significance of differential IIS in D. melanogaster and D. sechellia at the organismal level. By examining life history traits including lifespan, length of development, and stress resistance, I will obtain a comprehensive understanding of how differential IIS broadly affects these species. Moreover, I will measure the active components of the IIS pathway to identify the causal gene(s) that mediate differential IIS. Aim 2 details a plan to find the genetic basis underlying differential IIS between D. melanogaster and D. sechellia by using a multispecies comparative analysis approach to identify regulatory regions that correlate with IIS activity. Coding regions and cis-regulatory regions of candidate genes from D. melanogaster and D. sechellia will be tested for their activity. In Aim 3, I will perform a genome-wide RNAi screen to find IIS-dependent factors that influence ovariole development. The RNAi constructs will encompass components of all known signaling pathways in Drosophila as well as Sirtuins and a subset of meiotic proteins whose mutants show phenotypes similar to those in the IIS pathway. These studies will contribute towards the identification of the genetic mechanisms and IIS-dependent pathways that mediate ovariole formation, fecundity, and overall health."
"9406880","PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Despite important advances in the treatment of learning disabilities (LDs), the dominant approach to intervention?direct skills instruction?fails to meet the needs of 25-40% of LD students. Innovative approaches are therefore required to target the specific needs of subgroups of LD students in order to expand the framework for LD intervention. This Project addresses a subset of the LD population that (a) has been understudied, (b) experiences disproportionately poor response to intervention, and (c) represents an LD subtype with a distinctive set of needs. These students have difficulty that spans math problem solving (MPS) & reading comprehension (RC). We refer to this LD subtype as higher-order comorbid LDs. With this understudied population, a transdisciplinary team of researchers, spanning learning sciences, second language learning, LDs, and developmental psychology, investigate a high-risk innovative approach to LD intervention. This approach involves embedding language comprehension (LC) instruction in direct skills intervention, with instructional scaffolding to explicitly connect MPS, RC, & LC demands. Comorbid students (with co-occurring difficulty in MPS & RC) are randomly assigned to (1) LC instruction embedded in direct MPS intervention with scaffolding to connect MPS, RC, & LC demands; (2) LC instruction embedded in direct RC intervention with scaffolding to address MPS, RC, & LC demands; or (3) a control group. We test aligned and reciprocal effects of each condition on MPS & RC outcomes, and we test LC as a mediator of those effects. We also explore the robustness of these effects by examining the pattern of intervention effects for boys vs. girls and for native vs. non-native English speakers. This Project impacts science by testing the comorbidity hypothesis: LC plays a critical role in MPS and RC and provides direction for understanding this form of LD comorbidity and for offering a coordinated, efficient approach to improve both outcomes. This Project also impacts clinical practice by addressing higher-order comorbidity (MPS+RC difficulty) as an LD subtyping framework in a theoretically coordinated manner to simultaneously improve outcomes in two academic domains that are critical for successful life outcomes."
"9624266","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this application is to enable the submission of IND applications for Oxy(Gly)4-dKLH, a vaccine directed against oxycodone and related prescription opioids, and M(Gly)4-dKLH, a vaccine directed against heroin and morphine. The long-term goal of this work (not included in this proposal but planned to immediately follow) is an IND submission for the co-administration of these two vaccines to treat abuse or addiction from a broad range of prescription or illicit opioids. Opioid addiction and associated deaths have increased markedly in the last 15 years due to increased abuse of prescription opioids and more recently heroin as well. Medications to treat opioid abuse are available but, because of real or perceived limitations, less than 1 in 5 who could benefit opt to use them. Opioid vaccines represent an additional treatment option that could circumvent these limitations. In contrast to agonist medications (methadone, buprenorphine), vaccines are not addictive, pose no diversion risk, and have proven free of significant side effects. In contrast to naltrexone, vaccines don't cause dysphoria, won't preclude the use of certain opioids for legitimate medical needs such as surgery, and would have a longer duration of action than even depot naltrexone. For both agonist and antagonist maintenance therapies, many addicts choose to skip or stop their medication entirely at some point and relapse rates are quite high. Vaccines could be used in addition to these medications and offer protection against relapse during medication noncompliance or discontinuation. Heroin vaccines elicit high titers of drug-specific antibodies in animals that can block a wide range of addiction- relevant behaviors including heroin self-administration and reinstatement. We have developed one such vaccine M(Gly)4-dKLH consisting of morphine conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin subunit dimer (dKLH), a highly immunogenic carrier protein that is suitable for human use. We have also developed an analogous oxycodone vaccine Oxy(Gly)4-dKLH that blocks the effects of the most commonly abused prescription opioids: oxycodone, hydrocodone, and oxymorphone. When co-administered to rats, these two vaccines provide blockade of a wide variety of abused opioids. Specific Aims of the project are Aim 1: Optimization of vaccine formulation and dosing, and confirmation of key aspects of efficacy and safety of the vaccines in animal models, Aim 2: Optimize manufacturing processes, qualify product release assay methods for intermediates and final products, and transfer methods to Contract Manufacturing Organizations, Aim 3: Toxicology testing of cGMP vaccines, and Aim 4: Submission of IND application for Oxy(Gly)4-dKLH and completion of studies to support an IND application for M(Gly)4-dKLH. The main hypothesis of this project is that the M(Gly)4-dKLH and Oxy(Gly)4-dKLH vaccines can be manufactured in formulations suitable for human use, with preservation or enhancement of their efficacy over that previously demonstrated, and no toxicity."
"9469993","Project Summary (Abstract):  The rise of vancomycin resistance is of particular importance since this antibiotic is one of few remaining options to treat enterococcal infections. Vancomycin functions by binding to the terminal D-Ala-D-Ala residues of the pentapeptide portion of the cell-wall precursor lipid II. By binding lipid II, vancomycin effectively sequesters the substrate required for synthesizing the protective peptidoglycan cell wall layer, leaving the bacteria susceptible to osmotic lysis. Vancomycin-resistant bacteria have acquired a set of genes for enzymes that reprogram lipid II biosynthesis to replace D-Ala-D-Ala with D-Ala-D-Lac, to which vancomycin cannot efficiently bind, diminishing vancomycin's ability to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis. In resistant bacteria, the reprogramming enzymes are regulated by the VanR/VanS two-component system, and while the mechanism of resistance is understood, this regulation remains largely uncharacterized.  The phosphorylated form of VanR is an activated transcription factor that initiates the transcription of the resistance genes to reprogram lipid II biosynthesis. VanS is a sensor histidine kinase that modulates VanR's phosphorylation state according to the presence of vancomycin. In the absence of vancomcyin, VanS acts as a phosphatase to maintain VanR in its inactivated state. In the presence of vancomcyin, VanS detects the antibiotic, and transduces a signal to keep VanR phosphorylated. It remains unclear how VanS detects vancomcyin, and how that detection alters VanS activity; the studies I propose aim to clarify these processes. I also plan to explore the molecular basis of different vancomycin-resistance phenotypes seen in different bacterial strains, for which the inducibility of the resistance genes varies widely. These studies will begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of how the extracellular vancomycin signal is transduced to generate an intracellular response. Finally, I also plan to address the largest knowledge gap in our understanding of two- component systems, which stems from the lack of structural information, by crystallizing portions of the VanR/VanS system. Studying the structure and function of the VanR/VanS system will help elucidate the mechanism of induction by vancomycin, likely identifying new therapeutic targets against resistant bacteria."
"9568111","?Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section Dendritic spines are specialized actin-rich protrusions that serve as primary recipients of most excitatory synapses in the brain. Spines are extremely dynamic, exhibiting diverse structural and functional changes during development, in response to stimuli, as well as in learning and memory. While there is substantial evidence that several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases converge on a common theme of aberrant spine formation, the mechanisms of spine formation and how its dysfunction relates to disease is unclear. TAOK2 is a serine/threonine kinase implicated in neuronal development, and is one of the genes present in the 16p11.2 genomic locus. Despite its relevance in neuronal development and to ASD, the physiological neuronal substrates of TAOK2 kinase are not known. It is unclear how TAOK2 signaling mediates spine development and how an imbalance in TAOK2 gene dosage might contribute to neuronal and behavioral alterations associated with ASD. Using a combination of innovative approaches, this proposal aims to delineate the mechanistic role of TAOK2 kinase during synaptogenesis and to understand how dysfunction in this signaling pathway might contribute to disease. As a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Yuh-Nung Jan?s laboratory at UCSF, I gained skills in neurobiology, mass spectrometry, and chemical-genetics in addition to my graduate background in cell biology and biochemistry. During the K99 award period, I identified the role of TAOK2 in maturation of dendritic spines, synapse localization and compartmentalization of NMDA-receptor mediated calcium influx. Additionally, I mapped the direct neuronal substrates of TAOK2 and found that Septin 7 (Sept7) phosphorylation was required for maturation of dendritic spines through a phosphorylation dependent interaction with scaffold protein PSD95. With the new training and information acquired in the K99 phase, I will extend the scope of my research in the R00 phase: 1) systematic investigation of TAOK2 localization during spine development using super-resolution STORM imaging, 2) characterization of the TAOK2 pathway in ASD pathology using iPSC derived neurons from 16p11.2 deletion patients and 3) phosphoproteomic analysis of 16p11.2 CNV iPSC-derived neurons to identify global changes caused by imbalances in TAOK2 dosage, which may reveal clinically relevant insights into the pathogenesis of ASD. The support afforded by the R00 award will greatly facilitate my long-term goal as an independent investigator to elucidate signaling pathways involved in dendritic spine formation during normal and disease states."
"9406861","?    DESCRIPTION:  This application describes the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of a hydrogel dressing that dissolves and can be easily removed from the wound surface of a patient with second degree burns with no further trauma. Burns are one of the most common and devastating forms of trauma. Each year, more than 300,000 people die from fire-related burn injuries and millions suffer from burn-related disabilities and disfigurements with psychological, social, and economic effects on both the survivors and their families. Dressing removal is reported to be the time of most pain (after the burn itself) and opioids continue to be the mainstay of treatment for the burn patient. The duration of a burn dressing change in a typical injury requiring ICU/OR level care is often at least 60 minutes with induction of general anesthesia, which can extend to more than three hours depending on the case. At present, all clinically approved available dressings adhere to the wound surface so that each change of dressing leads to traumatization of newly formed tissues on the outer layer of the body's surface, delayed healing, and great personal suffering for the injured patient. The application describes a thiol- terminated dendron and a bifunctional NHS-activated PEG that react with each other to form a thioester-linked hydrogel dressing that can be subsequently dissolved by exposure of an aqueous thiol solution via a thiol- thiolester exchange mechanism. The proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that a hydrogel- based, dissolvable burn dressing will provide a barrier to infection, promote wound healing, and be easily removable on demand. Importantly, it presents preliminary data demonstrating the synthesis, characterization, and performance of a dissolvable hydrogel dressing prototype. The specific aims of this four- year application are: Aim 1: Synthesize and characterize a series of hydrogel burn dressings; Aim 2: Determine the in vitro toxicity and biocompatibility, as well as in vivo compatibility after subcutaneous implantation of the dissolvable dressing; and Aim 3: Evaluate the efficacy of the dissolvable dressing in vivo."
"9453187","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The candidate recently joined the staff at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the Cardiovascular Performance Program (CPP), a unique group whose goals include conducting top-caliber human health and performance research. A core mission of the CPP is to use longitudinal study design to examine cardiac adaptations to exercise. This proposal expands this model in a novel direction to evaluate cardiac metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) through research collaboration with Brigham and Women's Hospital.  This proposal focuses on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which develops in numerous cardiac diseases, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and has independent negative prognostic implications. In contrast to pathologic LVH, exercise-induced LVH (EI-LVH) is generally considered adaptive. Differentiating whether LVH is due to exercise or HCM is a clinical challenge with critical implications because HCM is the top cause of sudden death in young athletes. Though myocardial metabolism appears to be impaired in forms of pathologic LVH and is linked to the development of heart failure, comparatively little is known about myocardial metabolism in EI- LVH. The two major goals of this research proposal are to define if myocardial metabolic profiling will be capable of definitively differentiating EI-LVH from HCM AND, through this, to gain further mechanistic insight into how exercise capacity and myocardial function differ so widely in these two forms of LVH. Specifically, we hypothesize that characterization of myocardial metabolic efficiency (MME), substrate utilization, microvascular function, and circulating corollary plasma microRNAs (miRNA) will provide scientifically novel and clinically superior techniques for separating adaptive from pathologic LVH.  To achieve these goals, the applicant proposes a longitudinal, repeated measures study in which athletes will be examined using cardiac PET, echocardiography, and circulating miRNA profiling before and after sport- specific exercise training. Cardiac PET assessment will include measurement of myocardial oxidative metabolism, metabolic efficiency, and substrate utilization, both at rest and with acute exercise provocation. The myocardial metabolic profiles of trained athletes with LVH will be compared to that of patients with mild HCM and healthy controls, who will be similarly studied in the absence of an exercise training intervention.  The candidate's career development plan includes advanced training in exercise physiology, cardiac imaging, and research methodology, all under the mentorship of a unique multidisciplinary team. The science proposed in this grant will set the stage for future studies designed to manipulate myocardial metabolism across the spectrums of adaptive physiology and cardiovascular disease, which will form the basis of the candidate's future R01 proposals. Over the course of the K23 award, the candidate's goal is to develop into an independent clinical cardiovascular investigator."
"9523896","Innate immunity is an ancient system that prevents microbial infection in all animals, from worms to humans. In the face of daily exposure to potential pathogens, vertebrates use this system to prevent opportunistic infections such as invasive candidiasis through coordinated activities of barrier tissues and professional innate immune phagocytes. Deficiencies in neutrophils or barrier breaches predispose for lethal invasive candidiasis, the fourth most common nosocomial infection. Thus, understanding of Candida interaction with these host cells at mucosal surfaces promises to elucidate aspects of mucosal candidiasis and may reveal how this non-lethal disease progresses to invasive candidiasis.  While simplified in vitro studies have revealed how C. albicans can interact with epithelial cells and phagocytes, these in vitro interactions result in epithelial destruction rather than the containment usually seen in vivo. Thus, it is important to study C. albicans-barrier interactions in vivo to understand how phagocytes normally collaborate with the epithelium to prevent invasive candidiasis in vivo. The transparent zebrafish infection models we have developed enable us to study these events at high resolution within the complex natural environment of the intact host.  Our objective here is to use intravital imaging to determine how innate and epithelial immune response in vivo impacts epithelial invasion, a key aspect of C. albicans pathogenesis. We propose to test the hypothesis that phagocyte recruitment and epithelial barrier integrity block invasive hyphal growth of C. albicans. Our own preliminary data, combined with work from others, implicate neutrophils in blocking filamentous growth and mucosal tissue invasion. In Aim 1, we will capitalize on these preliminary results to discover how neutrophils directly target C. albicans, how their activity is modulated by chemokine signaling, and examine how other immune responses are altered in their absence. Published work implicates active epithelial responses in barrier protection, and our preliminary data has identified an epithelial receptor required for protection. In Aim 2, we will focus on this receptor to determine how epithelial signaling assists in immunity, examining its roles in immune response and epithelial organization during infection.  The long-term rationale for the proposed research is that intravital imaging of host-C. albicans dynamics in vivo will generate more complete models for fungal-innate immune dynamics during infection that may lead to more rational therapeutic approaches. The transparent zebrafish model of mucosal candidiasis offers a unique opportunity to characterize complex dialog that coordinates anti-fungal defense at this barrier. The proposed experiments are expected to reveal how neutrophil attack (Aim 1) and epithelial signaling (Aim 2) prevent C. albicans invasion of the mucosal epithelium, a crucial event in its pathogenesis."
"9467674","Project Summary/Abstract: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a consequence of peripheral nerve fiber dysfunction or degeneration, continues to be a dose-limiting and debilitating side effect during and/or after cancer chemotherapy. Potential interventions are needed due to the current lack of effective preventative or therapeutic treatments. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, nicotine, is capable of preventing the development of mechanical allodynia induced by paclitaxel, a taxane commonly used to treat breast, lung, and ovarian cancers, in a mouse model of CIPN. Previous studies suggest that CIPN, specifically induced by paclitaxel, may be a result of inflammatory processes. The literature also demonstrates that nicotine can protect neurons from various sources of toxicity via activation of the ?7 nAChR subtype. Therefore, the aims of this work are to determine if nicotine is neuroprotective in a mouse model of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy via the ?7 nAChR. Wild-type and ?7 nAChR knockout mice will be treated with paclitaxel and/or nicotine followed by an assessment of mechanical allodynia with the von Frey test and of intra-epidermal nerve fiber (IENF) loss with confocal microscopy. Subsequently, the site of nicotine-mediated ?7 nAChR activation will be investigated with Cre/lox macrophage-specific knockout of the ?7 nAChR. These mice will also be treated with paclitaxel and/or nicotine, then tested for mechanical allodynia and analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokines via an ELISA in various sensory tissues, including the hind paw epidermis, dorsal root ganglia, and spinal cord. After identifying the involvement of the ?7 nAChR in the protective role of nicotine, the pro-inflammatory effects of paclitaxel and potential anti-inflammatory role of nicotine will be further investigated by evaluating macrophage infiltration/microglial activation via immunohistochemistry. Lastly, nicotine will be chronically administered alone and in combination with paclitaxel in non-small cell lung cancer tumor-bearing mice in order to ensure that nicotine will not stimulate tumor growth or interfere with the anti-tumor effects of paclitaxel in vivo. Findings of the proposed work can be utilized to develop selective agonists and allosteric modulators for the ?7 nAChR to further improve efficacy and minimize any potential side effects or remaining concerns regarding nicotine. Most importantly, it is possible that this site of therapeutic intervention is common to some or all neuropathy-inducing chemotherapy drug classes, including vincristine, platinum compounds, and bortezomib."
"9390872","CORE-019: EARLY PHASE CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT (EPCRS)  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  A major area of institutional support for clinical cancer research is for investigator-initiated trials. The arrival of  new investigators into the OSUCCC, the increased attention paid to translational research and changes in the  funding landscape of clinical trials requires that there be a mechanism for funding investigator initiated studies  of novel agents and/or novel design. The support of innovative Phase I trials and pilot studies was previously  supported by the CCSG-mandated Protocol Specific Research Support mechanism. With the recent changes  in the CCSG guidelines, the Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS) mechanism has been employed  since late 2013 as a means of stimulating the conduct of early phase, investigator-initiated studies. The  EPCRS process is overseen by Dr. William Carson, the Associate Director for Clinical Research (ADCR).  Investigators are informed of this OSUCCC support mechanism via official communications from OSUCCC  administration and the Disease Specific Research Group (DSRG) leaders. There is a formal application  process which is conducted quarterly. Proposals are reviewed by a panel, chaired by the ADCR, Dr. William  Carson. Successful applications are selected for CCSG support in the form of research nurse or data  management assistance from the CCC supported Clinical Trials Office (CTO). On average 1-3 studies have  been approved for support each quarter. In the current funding cycle, a total of 13 studies have been  supported by the EPCRS and have accrued a total of 175 patients in the last year. In addition, to EPCRS, the  OSUCCC has a formal, peer-reviewed mechanism, called the Intramural Research Program (IRP), to channel  developmental funds from Pelotonia, our annual bicycle fundraising event, into bench to beside research."
"9545134","Abstract Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is chronic autoimmune disease with a strong genetic component of susceptibility. While polymorphisms in many genes can increase SLE risk, there is limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms by which these variants contribute to SLE disease. Recent genome- wide association studies have identified variants of the ITGAM gene, encoding the CD11b chain of the CD11b/CD18 integrin, Mac-1, as major risk factors for SLE. A strong risk effect is mapped to rs1143679, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) resulting in an Arginine to Histidine substitution at position 77 (R77H). Studies in different cell types concluded that the R77H variant compromises ligand binding and various Mac-1 functions, without affecting integrin surface expression. How R77H affects ligand binding was not clear as it is located in the ?-propeller domain, outside the ligand-binding ?I- domain. Productive ligand binding requires that CD18 integrins undergo conformational (allosteric) changes that are relayed to the ?I ligand-binding domain. We uncovered that R77H has a defect in allostery relay that results in reduced binding affinity for complement C3. rs1143679 (R77H) is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1143678 (P1146S) and rs1143683 (A858V), located in the cytoplasmic and calf-1 regions of CD11b, respectively. While A858V is a conservative change not likely to alter Mac-1 function, the cytoplasmic SNP affects cell adhesion. The gaps in the field are the lack of information on how Mac-1 regulates functions relevant to SLE in specific cell types and the in vivo consequences of the ITGAM SNPs. This could be addressed in genetically engineered mice. However, the SNPs are in regions not conserved between mouse and human ITGAM. The goal of this proposal is to generate mice expressing a human/mouse CD11b chimera in a cell type specific manner in Mac-1 deficient mice, characterize these mice for Mac-1 expression and function and generate mice harboring R77H and P1146S in the human sequences of the chimera. We have generated the human/mouse chimera and shown efficient pairing with mouse CD18 and appropriate integrin function. We have placed the construct downstream of a LoxP-Stop cassette and shown Cre-induced expression in a cell line, which will allow cell type specific deletion when transgenic mice are mated to appropriate Cre driver mice. This is a high-risk proposal as there are potential pitfalls with generation of a chimeric integrin that recapitulates the phenotype of the human SNPs. The high reward is that modeling these SNPs in vivo will not only provide insights into how these SNPs modulate leukocyte functions in vivo and thus lupus susceptibility but may also aid in understanding the inhibitory function of Mac-1 in human SLE that could have relevance for non-carrier lupus patients and potentially result in new therapeutic leads."

"9406146","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have established that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is superior to medical therapy in preventing stroke in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. However, while the majority of patients who undergo carotid revascularization receive treatment for asymptomatic disease, the benefit of revascularization for patients with asymptomatic disease is quite modest. In addition, the clinical trials were initiated about 20 years ago, and in the intervening period, medical therapy has greatly improved for this vascular disease due to new pharmacological advances such as high potency statins, improved antiplatelet regimens, and better control of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes. In parallel, as the surgical complication rate for CEA has decreased, the use of carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been gaining favor in the treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis. While recent trials have focused exclusively on comparing CEA to CAS, the declining stroke rate associated with medically managed carotid stenosis has led many to question whether either revascularization procedure is superior to aggressive vascular risk factor control. A three-arm RCT could answer this question, but such a study would be very expensive, not provide answers for a long time, and might only enroll the subset of healthiest patients typically studied in an RCT. Since the first RCT was published that demonstrated the superiority of CEA compared to medical therapy there has been a concern that the modest benefit observed in the trials may not be reproducible in the community. To address the ongoing debate of whether among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, CEA is still superior to medical therapy and whether CAS is superior to medical therapy (which has never been evaluated in an RCT), we propose to examine the comparative effectiveness of initial medical therapy compared to early carotid intervention in a retrospective cohort study of 6000 patients using merged Veteran's Health Administration and Medicare data. We will specifically compare each revascularization strategy to medical therapy and also examine the impact of a number of key variables (e.g. age, presence of atrial fibrillation) on the comparative effectiveness of intervention compared to medical therapy. We will use advanced statistical techniques to overcome observed and unobserved differences in the medical therapy and intervention cohorts. We will compare the 30-day and 5 year outcomes of 3175 patients managed medically, 1500 patients who received CEA, and 1325 patients who received CAS entering the cohort from 2005 to 2008. Our overarching hypothesis is that medical therapy has improved to a degree that only certain subgroups of patients may benefit from revascularization and that for many patients medical therapy may be the preferred treatment strategy."

The LTB procures samples in 2 ways, via a general biobanking protocol as well as using specific clinical research protocols, collecting blood, bone marrow, leukapheresis products and others as requested. The LTB performs rapid processing of biospecimens, e.g., cell isolation and cryopreservation, assesses the quality of collected samples, delivers fresh samples or stores them for future use, provides clinical annotation for study subjects and distributes samples to investigators. Additional services available to researchers include serial collections, specialized processing, specialized specimen preparation and characterization, protocol optimization, and assistance with design of laboratory and clinical correlative studies. The LTB is a longstanding biobank, and with a >90% subject participation rate, it has collected 14,233 samples from 5,195 subjects, allowing for detailed investigations of many subtypes of hematologic cancers. Dr. Lucas is the Director of the LTB, and Dr. Bloomfield is the Senior Faculty Advisor. The Specific Aims of the LTB are: 1) to consent subjects and procure samples from hematologic malignancy patients using state-of-the art procedures to optimally preserve the value of patient materials; 2) to uniformly process, characterize and store biospecimens; and, 3) to provide biospecimens with associated clinical, pathological and genomic data to OSUCCC researchers and to outside institutions so that they can correlate findings from patient samples with clinical or population-based outcomes. The LTB coordinates with other OSUCCC shared resources, e.g., Analytical Cytometry, Genomics, Pharmacoanalytical, and the Clinical Trials Processing Laboratory. During the last five year grant period, the LTB supported the research of 34 investigators, 30 of whom were OSUCCC members. Together, the LTB samples were used for 98 publications, of which 18 were published in journals with an impact factor >10, and 15 NCI grants. As a future direction, the facility will be expanded with OSUCCC support as required to meet researchers' needs. Working with the Genomics Shared Resource and the Bioinformatics Shared Resource, we will embark upon indexing leukemia samples based on genomic profiles. The LTB leverages extensive institutional support and seeks only 15.3% support from CCSG funds. The Leukemia Tissue Bank Shared Resource is part of the Clinical Grouping."
"9599843","Abstract Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the number one cause of serious, long term disability. Of the nearly 800,000 annual strokes, approximately 25% will be recurrent events. Unfortunately, recurrent strokes are more deadly and most likely to cause disability when compared to a first stroke. Genetic studies focusing on recurrent stroke have been extremely limited. We have identified two novel gene regions associated with recurrent stroke and aim to use next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) to fine-map these regions to hone in on the likely causal variants. For 182 recurrent stroke patients from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial, we will utilize NGS platforms to identify all genetic variants across 1.5 Mb spanning the two novel gene regions associated with recurrent stroke. High priority variants will be genotyped in all 2,100 VISP participants and analyzed for association with recurrent stroke. NGS is a cutting edge technology that provides a powerful approach to identify novel and important genetic contributors to recurrent stroke, a phenotype that has been poorly studied. This approach may allow improved personalization of risk assessment and targeted prevention. Moreover, VISP participants include both African Americans (AA) and European Americans, therefore this proposal may identify genetic risk variants specific to populations of African descent that might not otherwise be identified in other studies focused primarily on populations of European ancestry. These variants may help address why African Americans have nearly 2x greater risk of suffering a stroke, and are more likely to die following a stroke, as compared to European Americans. Furthermore, these findings may have broader implications by providing insight on other issues influencing recurrent stroke such as the ability to control manageable risk factors (e.g. hypertension and atrial fibrillation) and likewise one?s response to treatment for anticoagulation, antiplatelet, and antihypertensive medications. Moreover, these finding may reflect post stroke treatment response to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only FDA approved treatment for ischemic stroke. Aligned with the goals of the NIH Academic Research Enhancement Award (AREA) Program (R15), we aim to explore a significant research question while exposing students to research, in particular learning cutting edge skills in Genomics, Population Genetics, Biotechnology techniques involving NGS library preparations, and Bioinformatics skills focused on analyzing NGS data and performing statistical analyses for genetic studies."
"9405875","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural scenes often contain multiple entities. The ability to segregate visual scenes into distinct objects and surfaces, referred to as segmentation, is a fundamental function of vision. Segmentation is crucial for interpreting visual images and for generating the perception of our environment. However, the neural mechanisms underlying image segmentation are not well understood. Our long-term goal is to understand the neural basis underlying perceptual organization and ultimately how perception arises from activity in neuronal network. Among sub-modalities of vision, visual motion provides a potent cue for segmentation. The proposed research uses visual motion to investigate how multiple stimuli are represented by neurons in the visual cortex such that the segmentation and perception of multiple stimuli can be achieved. To isolate the effects of visual motion cues from those of spatial cues on image segmentation, we will use random-dot patterns that move in the same region of visual space in different directions. Previous studies have shown that the responses of cortical neurons elicited by multiple, perceptually separable, stimuli tend to follow the average o the responses elicited by the constituent stimuli presented alone. Such a scheme, however, poses a challenge in segmenting two stimuli that differ only slightly, because averaging essentially takes away the information regarding the identities of individual stimulus components. The central problem to be addressed by the proposed research is how the segmentation of slightly different, but perceptually distinguishable, stimuli is achieved by the visual system. We will combine the methods of neurophysiology, behavior and computation to achieve our goals. The proposal has two specific aims. In Aim #1, we will determine how multiple moving stimuli are represented by populations of neurons in the visual cortex and the temporal dynamics of such neural representation, while the visual system solves the problem of segmenting overlapping stimuli moving in different directions. In Aim #2, we will elucidate how visual depth and speed cues, and selective attention modulate the neural representation of multiple stimuli moving in different directions. The proposed research will provide insight into fundamental neural operations of cortical network in processing sensory information and will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual organization. Insights gained from studying normal visual functions promise to improve our understanding of the cause, treatment and prevention of disorders of vision and eye movements."
"9415045","This proposal represents a joint effort combining the vast infrastructure, extensive clinical and research experience, as well as large patient volumes in heart failure at the Cleveland Clinic, together with the clinical trial expertise and diverse patient populations at University Hospitals and MetroHealth Medical Center to establish the Cleveland Regional Clinical Center (RCC). Led by Drs. W. H. Wilson Tang and Randall C. Starting and joined by Drs. James Fang and Mark Dunlap as co-investigators, and taking advantage of the Cleveland Clinical and Translational Sciences Collaborative (CTSC) that recently integrated the research infrastructure our three institutions, our goal is to participate in the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network to test new hypotheses and therapies to advance the management of heart failure. In particular, we hope to expand our longstanding academic interest in developing strategies to alleviate cardio-renal compromise in congestive heart failure. Our proposed project serves as a mechanistic study to discern the possible role of renal sympathetic nerves in mediating cardiac and/or renal complications of the cardio-renal syndrome. Utilizing a novel, catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) technique currently under investigation for treatment of refractory hypertension (Symplicity Catheter System), we test the hypothesis that in patients with hypertensive heart failure recently admitted for congestive heart failure that RSD may provide incremental improvement in neurohormonal profile, improve cardio-renal function, and facilitate symptomatic relief over usual care. Our consortium provides a unique opportunity to contribute to the overall Network with clinical trials expertise and leadership in heart failure to fulfill the scientific requirements, and the diverse and broad regional patient populations across a wide range of practice settings with proven abilities to recruit and fulfill the performance requirements, and to test a novel treatment approach to tackle one of the most challenging aspects of contemporary heart failure."
"9424031","Project Summary Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is a unique form of diabetes which develops in the majority of patients with non-mild cystic fibrosis (CF) by middle age. Even when the degree of hyperglycemia is minimal, CFRD worsens lung disease and shortens life expectancy. The causes of CFRD are multifactorial and include insufficient insulin secretion, hepatic insulin resistance, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. While exocrine insufficiency is explained by deficient pancreatic ductal anion transport due to loss of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function, the causes of diminished insulin secretion and hepatic insulin resistance are not fully understood. CF induces significant primary disease not only in the exocrine pancreas, but also in stomach and intestine owing to loss of CFTR function in the gut epithelium. Relatedly, a variety of gut / splanchnic hormones are disrupted in CF, and these alterations have been postulated to contribute to CFRD. The most consistently altered splanchnic hormone in CF is pancreatic polypeptide (PP), a hormone whose metabolic actions have been neglected following the finding that PP-knockout (PP-KO) mice lack a glucose metabolism phenotype. PP levels are universally low in CF and unresponsive to physiological stimuli that normally induce secretion. We find circulating PP deficiency is present even in very young children with CF and in CFTR-KO ferrets despite abundant PP-cells in the pancreas. Using these CF ferrets and newly generated PP-KO ferrets, we find that supplementation and deficiency of PP have broad effects on glucose metabolism, representing the first molecular genetic data confirming classic physiological studies indicating metabolic effects of PP. We hypothesize that PP deficiency in CF represents an underlying parasympathetic neuronal defect in islet function and contributes to insulin resistance in the liver of individuals with CF. To determine the mechanism causing deficient PP secretion in CF, we will test the functional, structural, and neurochemical integrity of parasympathetic neuronal innervation to the PP-secreting cells of the pancreas. Using traced euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps, we will determine the mechanism by which PP supplementation, using peptide and genetic approaches, improves glucose tolerance in PP-KO and CF ferrets and determine the PP-receptor involved in this action. We will examine whether PP supplementation, through its pancreatostatic actions, lessens exocrine pancreatic destruction in CF. Finally, through a newly created CFTR-G551D mutant knock-in ferret, where the function of the CFTR mutant can be restored by a small molecule potentiator, we will investigate the connections between early exocrine pancreatic disease in CF and subsequent endocrine pancreas dysfunction including poor PP secretion. Our studies will not only increase understanding of the glucoregulatory actions of PP, but are expected to unlock new understanding of CFRD pathogenesis. The knowledge gained will help open new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to CFRD and also to other hyperglycemic low-PP states such as diabetes complicating chronic pancreatitis."
"9589090","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitosis is the process by which a replicated set of chromosomes is equally distributed between two daughter cells. Because cells require a complete genetic blueprint to function properly, it is essential for mitosis to occur without error mis-segregation of even a single chromosome can be the cause of genetic disease, cancer, and death. Chromosomes are segregated by a microtubule-based cellular machine termed the spindle. A key feature of the spindle is its bipolar geometry, an organization that naturally allow chromosomes to be segregated in two directions. Other organizational states, such as monopolarity or multipolarity, are largely incompatible with life and cause cell death via apoptosis. This renewal application is focused on how spindle bipolarity is both established and maintained. Spindle bipolarity in most eukaryotic cells is established by Eg5, a kinesin-5 motor. However, we discovered in the previous grant cycle that bipolarity in human cancer cells can be established through a novel Eg5-indpendent mechanism. This finding has important clinical implications, as kinesin-5 inhibitors (K5Is) have not performed well as anti-cancer agents in early stage clinical trials. Our work suggests that the inefficacy of K5Is may stem from alternative, compensatory spindle assembly pathways. Once the spindle has formed, it must remain bipolar despite the presence of forces that act in opposition to Eg5. The source, magnitude and temporal fluctuations of Eg5-opposing/assisting forces are not well-characterized, but our data implicate the involvement of kinetochore-attached microtubules (K- MTs). In this grant, we will: 1) Determine when and how K-MTs contribute to bipolarity maintenance; 2) Study features of a second kinesin (Kif15) key for Eg5-independent spindle assembly; and 3) Further characterize non-canonical spindle assembly mechanisms and their physiological shortcomings. This work will advance our understanding of spindle mechanics and have immediate relevance to the development of anti-mitotic chemotherapeutic strategies."
"9564458","Dystonias are a group of devastating neurological movement disorders characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that can affect any body region. There is no cure or effective treatment as the pathophysiology of the disorder remains largely unknown. In focal dystonia, symptoms are restricted to one specific body part. Dystonia affecting the hand is called focal hand dystonia (FHD), whereas when the vocal chords are affected it is termed adductor spasmodic dysphonia (AdSD). Despite different clinical manifestations (impaired voice or use of hand), both are thought to share a common underlying mechanism. But commonalities in pathophysiology of focal dystonias have not been well explored. Our central hypothesis is that focal dystonia is a brain network disorder with desynchronized connectivity (?dysconnectivity?), or ineffective collaboration between brain areas within the network associated with the dystonic task during either resting state, active state or both. This hypothesis can be tested with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) seeds that represent different but related parts of the voluntary motor network. Therefore, using each seed for a functional connectivity (fc) assessment elucidates more precisely the nature of the dysconnectivity. We will determine the fc during resting state (resting state fc) and active state (task fc) between the loci and through the whole brain. Aim 1 will determine the individual fc of fMRI and TMS loci for the vocalization and hand motor networks in CTL and dystonia. Sub Aim 1.1 will determine if the individual fc between fMRI and TMS loci differs between CTL and dystonia and if this difference is state dependent, meaning the fc differs between resting (resting state fc) and active (task fc); Sub Aim 1.2 will determine if the individual whole brain fc map differs between CTL and dystonia and if this difference is related to a certain loci or state; Sub Aim 1.3 will determine if fc analyzed in standard space reveal differences between CTL and dystonia and if this difference is state dependent. Aim 2 will determine the relationship between disease severity and brain behavioral findings. Relevance: The pathophysiology of focal dystonia is unknown. Recent advances in neuroimaging and brain stimulation made by this team will allow multimodal assessments of anatomical and voluntary brain networks that will provide a novel window into the pathophysiology of both FHD and AdSD individually, as well as determine unifying features in both disorders. These findings will leave us well positioned to develop common treatment strategies in all focal dystonias based upon specific physiologic underpinnings. Further, the unique nature of this focal brain-based disease also has implications for our understanding of general brain function. Understanding how brain networks interact and form faulty associations could have wide reaching implications for many other disorders."
"9435969","Project Summary Affecting nearly 1 in every 250 children in the United States, juvenile arthritis are the most common chronic illnesses of childhood. In past years, pediatric rheumatology research has made a great deal of progress in knowledge of the outcome assessment and disease management. It is now time to learn more about how to treat and prevent disease- and treatment-related morbidities. Without questioning the usefulness and effectiveness of immunosuppressive treatment for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), it must be acknowledged that the manipulation of the immune system inherent to these therapies increases the risk of infection for these patients. Infection is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with rheumatic disease. Despite significant advances in pediatric rheumatology research, many questions remain regarding the risk of infection associated with immunosuppressant therapeutic agents commonly used to treat JIA and the published data is inconsistent and inadequately understood. The overall goal of this proposal is to study the safety of common immunosuppressive treatments for pediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who are at high risk for infections through three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether juvenile idiopathic arthritis immunosuppressive treatments increase the risk of infections requiring hospitalization (serious infections), ED or outpatient care (non-serious infections). Specific Aim 2 will estimate the degree of infection risk associated with each treatment. Specific Aim 3 will compare infection risk and discontinuation rate for the most commonly prescribed tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) agents in JIA to optimize selection of JIA therapy. Our proposed study will capitalize on an existing data set to address pressing knowledge gaps surrounding the relative safety of common JIA-related therapies with regard to hospitalizations and infections. This proposal will improve the quality of pediatric care for patients with rheumatic diseases, while furthering the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) mission to conduct and support research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious diseases. The long-term goal of this research is to identify modalities to decrease infections in pediatric patients with rheumatic diseases by producing evidence-based knowledge. Establishing such methodologies can be used to decrease infections in children with similar complex medical conditions."

"9405899","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a form of acute respiratory failure resulting from a variety of insults including sepsis, smoke inhalation and severe trauma. ARDS has a high mortality rate of 30-40%, which results in approximately 75,000 deaths per year. This exceeds the mortality due to breast or prostate cancer. Treatment of ARDS is based on supportive mechanical ventilation that is applied while the underlying cause of respiratory failure hopefully resolves. However, selecting appropriate ventilation parameters is difficult because of the conflicting requirements imposed by the inhomogeneous nature of lung injury in ARDS. Inspiratory pressures must be sufficiently low to avoid over-distention of the delicate parenchyma (volutrauma) while at the same time expiratory pressures must be high enough to prevent damage caused by the repetitive collapse (derecruitment) and reopening (recruitment) of airways and alveoli (atelectrauma). Volutrauma and atelectrauma can both lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) which is manifest as local accumulation of edema in the airspaces. This, in turn, leads to surfactant inactivation, increased tissue stress, and further VILI in a positive feedback mechanism that often leads to death. However, exactly how VILI begins within the lung tissue, and then develops over time, remains poorly understood. We hypothesize that edema and atelectasis begin locally in regions of high tissue stress and then propagate outward to consume the rest of the lung as a result of fluid-structure interactions. This is exacerbated during mechanical ventilation because ventilation heterogeneity amplifies the damage generated in local stress foci. We will test this hypothesis by using design- based stereology to quantify how the spatial distributions of edema and atelectasis change with time during the progression of VILI in mouse models of ARDS. These measurements will then inform the development of a computational model of an alveolar network that couples solid and fluid mechanics to determine how inhomogeneous edema alters microscale tissue stress and recruitment/derecruitment. The numerical model will be used to investigate potentially protective modes of mechanical ventilation, such as variable tidal volume ventilation, that avoid persistently concentrating stress in fixed regions of the lung tissue, as tends to occur with conventional regular ventilation. These studies will facilitate the development of novel protective ventilation strategies for ARDS and thereby help reduce mortality. The PI of this proposal has extensive experience with numerical modeling, animal experimentation, and organ-scale physiology. Complementary training in morphometric analysis will provide the PI with the skills necessary to quantify the micro-scale effects of lung injury, and to link these structural changes to lung function and injury progression using computational models. This program of study and research, together with the world-class research environment provided by the University of Vermont College of Medicine, will enable the PI to develop a career as an independent investigator applying bioengineering and computational methods to the study of lung disease."

She completed Internal Medicine residency and a T32 Nephrology Research Fellowship at Baylor. She joined BCM as an Assistant Professor in Nephrology in July 2013. The application is devised to make use of research resources and expertise of successful investigators at BCM. Dr. Pan has created a Career Advisory Committee consisting of senior investigators dedicated to mentoring young scientists to provide guidance with her research and career development. Dr. David Sheikh- Hamad, Professor of Medicine (Nephrology) at BCM, will serve as her primary mentor. He is funded by a VA Merit award and NIH R01 and is an expert in renal inflammation, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) kidney injury, and the anti-oxidant actions of stanniocalcins. Her co-advisors are: 1) William E. Mitch, MD, an expert in muscle metabolism; 2) Qiang Tong, PhD, an innovator in sirtuin research; 3) Lee-Jun Wong, PhD, an expert in mitochondrial genetics and function; and 4) Vijay Yechoor, MD, a successful investigator in insulin resistance and diabetes. Dr. Pan?s career development plan includes frequent meetings with her mentors, didactics to increase scientific knowledge, and attending conferences to present her research.  Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and associated with increased morbidity/mortality, and progression to chronic kidney disease. However, the therapeutic options for AKI remain limited. ATP/nutrient depletion and oxidative stress play important roles in the pathogenesis. Our data suggest that stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) suppresses ROS and confers resistance to I/R kidney injury (a model for ischemic AKI) through AMPK activation, preferentially the AMPK?2 isoform. Moreover, STC1 induces the mitochondrial longevity gene SIRT3 via AMPK activation. SIRT3 has been shown to suppress ROS, and this grant will test the Central Hypothesis that: STC1/AMPK?2/SIRT3 is an inducible and adaptive energy sensing pathway that suppresses mitochondrial superoxide production and protects from I/R kidney injury. Using in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation injury model, Aim I will examine whether selective siRNA knockdown of AMPK?2 diminishes STC1-induced cytoprotection and SIRT3 expression. Using double mutant STC1 Tg/AMPK?1 KO or STC1 Tg/AMPK?2 KO mice, Aim II will examine in vivo whether STC1-induced renoprotection is mediated through preferential activation of AMPK?2. Using SIRT3 Tg and SIRT3 KO mice, as well as in vitro overexpression or siRNA- mediated knockdown of SIRT3, Aim III will determine whether SIRT3 overexpression is protective from ischemic kidney injury. Aim IV will examine the role of SIRT3 in the observed sexual dimorphism in ischemic AKI, and the effect of sex hormone modulation on SIRT3/AMPK expression. Our studies identify STC1/AMPK?2/SIRT3 as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of ischemic AKI, and the proposed aims will characterize and further define the role of SIRT3 and AMPK?2 in kidney protection.  The research environment at BCM is ideal for fostering the continued education and development of young physician investigators. Dr. Pan will benefit from outstanding mentoring and strong institutional support."
"9548768","Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in all cellular signaling and gene regulation protein networks, and their misregulation has been associated with a variety of diseases, notably cancer. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. However, PPIs feature large, flat binding surfaces, lacking the tight-binding cavities that define typical drug targets. Accordingly, many PPIs pose a fundamental thermodynamic challenge to the development of conventional small molecule modulators. A promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because?by definition?only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. Targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach traditionally employed to enhance binding affinities of small molecules, but the approach has a potential drawback as the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads may lead to nonspecific interactions and toxicity. Here we propose to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods?PDMs and covalent inhibition? while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein- protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity."
"9472211","Nearly 30 million patients in North America and Europe have been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD). While all patients suffer from quality-of-life issues due to decreased limb perfusion, unmanaged PAD ultimately leads to about 250,000 annual low extremity amputations in the western world. Surgical and endovascular revascularization is performed in an effort to reopen occluded vessels, but 40% of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) do not qualify for these procedures due to extreme tissue damage and/or diffuse atherosclerotic disease. Even with revascularization, the rate of amputation and five-year mortality rate remain high. Thus, these patients have a critically unmet need for limb salvage therapy.  Biomaterials have shown promise in the treatment of numerous diseases, including PAD. We were the first to show a decellularized skeletal muscle ECM hydrogel improved perfusion, arteriogenesis, and muscle regeneration in rat hindlimb ischemia injury. In side-by-side comparisons of skeletal muscle ECM and a human umbilical cord ECM, only the skeletal muscle ECM improved skeletal muscle morphology and regeneration, suggesting a tissue-specific effect in muscle-dependent regeneration. Others have shown that tissue specific decellularized materials impact tissue specific cell types in vitro, but has not been definitively studied in vivo.  Thus, the goal of this proposal is to mechanistically interrogate tissue specificity of ECM hydrogels on skeletal muscle regeneration through quantitative systems-level analysis. We will be the first group to demonstrate quantitatively and functionally the impact of properly controlled tissue specific ECM hydrogels in a complex in vivo microenvironment. We hypothesize that the tissue specific source of decellularized extracellular matrix will differentially impact whole muscle function, genetic pathway activation, and the spatiotemporal muscle regenerative response in vivo. We propose to develop improved ECM hydrogels for PAD to revascularize and regenerate damaged skeletal muscle with the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Demonstrate impact of decellularized hydrogel tissue specificity on functional whole muscle contractility and blood perfusion.  Aim 2: Determine effects of tissue specific ECM hydrogels on transcriptomic and spatiotemporal cellular responses in muscle regeneration.  This project will use a myriad of multi-scale tools, such as biomaterial fabrication techniques, in vivo animal studies, muscle functional testing, bioinformatics, and immunohistochemistry to accomplish the aims and develop the PI for a career in scientific research. With an aging population the incidence of PAD is expected to increase with no synchronous improvements in treatment strategies. We have the potential to reduce this extreme outcome through mechanistic understanding of minimally invasive, injectable, and easily fabricated decellularized materials."
"9518140","Project: EVO (or ?EVO?) is a mobile 3D video game that has been shown to reduce older adults' susceptibility to interference by augmenting sustained attention and working memory abilities (e.g. cognitive control) through targeted adaptive algorithms. The combination of peer-reviewed validity, adaptivity, and fun video game mechanics elevates the EVO platform beyond other at-home training tools while reducing burden associated with tedious task replication. We propose to study EVO as a potential intervention for the treatment of depression, a disorder that worsens medical outcomes, promotes disability, increases expense, and complicates medical care by clouding the clinical picture and undermining treatment adherence. R61 Phase: We will first conduct a 2-year proof of concept study to determine if EVO can engage the cognitive control network (CCN) in 30 middle-aged and older adults with major depression. Primary aims for this phase of the proposed project are to determine if EVO will result in greater CCN engagement using three levels of analysis (circuitry, performance, self-report). At the circuitry level, we will measure CCN engagement by probing the system using task-based fMRI. We hypothesize that activation and functional connectivity (FC) of anterior aspects of the CCN will increase from baseline to 4-weeks after treatment initiation. Our decision to move to the next phase of the planned study is that 66% of our sample will show significant increases in CCN functions at the circuitry level of analysis (CCN activation and FC) and at either the performance level or self- report level of analysis. R33 Phase: Should our proof of concept phase pass the Go/No-go rule, we will then conduct a 3-year pilot study to compare EVO to an expectancy-matched control game in terms of CCN target engagement at the circuitry (task-based fMRI) and behavioral levels (task performance, self-report) in 60 middle-aged and older adults with major depression. In addition, we well determine if changes in target engagement are associated with changes in mood and mood-induced disability. The decision to move onto development of a proposal to study the clinical efficacy of EVO in a larger randomized clinical trial will be based on whether we find (1) that EVO out-performs our control condition in terms of the engagement of CCN at the circuitry and behavioral levels (2) significant associations between changes in engagement of the CCN and changes in mood and (3) that the study methods are feasible to complete (sampling rate, retention, intervention adherence, intervention acceptability and expectancy-match for our control condition)."
"9594374","Project Summary - eDecdete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers  Latinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to have access to health, to have knowledge of existing smoking cessation resources, to receive advice to stop smoking, and to participate in smoking cessation programs. Mobile technologies can dramatically enhance the reach of effective smoking cessation interventions. However, the reach of mobile interventions among Latinos remains minimal despite the fact that Latinos utilize smartphones at a higher rate. The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of eDecdete (Spanish for ?you can choose?), an innovative 12 week mobile smoking cessation intervention based on this work that incorporates two elements: 1) a tablet-based e-health educational session that collects personal smoking-related information to develop an individualized quit plan and guide automated and interactive text messaging; and 2) a text messaging program that includes educational information, behavioral strategies, motivational and supportive messaging, and prompts to use pharmacotherapy to support smoking cessation. Aim 1. To evaluate the impact of the culturally accommodated eDecdete program versus standard care on smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. At Month 6, smokers in eDecdete will have significantly higher cotinine-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (no cigarettes in the past 7 days) than smokers in the control arm. Aim 2. To assess therapeutic alliance, pharmacotherapy utilization, and self-efficacy as mediators of the presumed treatment effect on cotinine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. Our hypothesis is that eDecdete will have greater efficacy for smoking cessation than standard care by increasing therapeutic alliance, utilization of pharmacotherapy, and self-efficacy to quit. Aim 3. To conduct a process evaluation that can inform findings and future improvements. The evaluation will assess 1) satisfaction with the program and its components; 2) text-message system utilization patterns and common content themes in text message interactions among eDecdete participants."
"9618453","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (Bayesian brain) have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against hardwired Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation."
"9469659","Project Summary/Abstract  Shigella spp. and other pathogens target host cell signaling pathways to create an environment conducive to survival and replication. Identifying these signaling pathways and how they are manipulated by pathogens is essential for understanding pathogenesis. Gram-negative bacterial pathogens such as Shigella deliver effector proteins into host cells that modify the cellular environment. OspB is an effector introduced into host cells by the Shigella type 3 secretion system, a protein apparatus that delivers effectors directly from Shigella into the host cell cytoplasm. Our lab recently found that OspB activates the mTORC1 signaling pathway and sensitizes cells to rapamycin inhibition of mTORC1, the master regulator of cell growth. How OspB activates mTORC1 is unknown. I found that OspB is predicted to be structurally homologous to the cysteine protease domain of a family of toxins that includes RtxA from Vibrio cholerae and TcdB from Clostridium difficile. The putative catalytic sites and substrate binding pocket residues of RtxA are conserved in OspB. We found that expression of OspB in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces sensitivity of yeast cells to caffeine and rapamycin and that the putative catalytic cysteine and histidine are required to induce sensitivity, suggesting that OspB function is conserved across divergent branches of life, that the putative catalytic site cysteine and histidine are required for OspB enzymatic activity, and that the target(s) of OspB may be the same in human and yeast cells.  Based on these results, I hypothesize that OspB is a cysteine protease and that OspB enzymatic activity modifies mTORC1 and/or an associated protein(s) in a manner that leads to its activation and to sensitization to rapamycin inhibition of mTORC1. The proposed project is designed to determine how OspB alters the mTORC1 signaling pathway. I will (1) test its function as a cysteine protease using activity-based probes and in vivo assays in mammalian cells and (2) define host factors required for OspB function using biochemical and genetic approaches. Identification of a mechanism for OspB function would guide our understanding of other bacterial proteases and provide insights into fundamental mechanisms of mTORC1 regulation."
"9604661","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Faithful replication of DNA and repair of damaged DNA, essential to cell propagation and survival, proceeds via the action of multi-protein machines. While considerable progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms of DNA replication and repair from studies of bacteria and other lower organisms, information on humans is lacking because the protein sequences and structures are not conserved. Our long-term goals are to understand the action of human DNA replication and nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery. Our strategy is to elucidate the structural basis for these processes using the full complement of modern structural biology tools and interpret this information using a range of biochemical and biological approaches. We have shown in the SV40 model system that the helicase that creates the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at the origin of replication also actively loads the human ssDNA binding protein replication protein A (RPA), and that this action is essential for DNA priming by DNA polymerase??-primase (pol-prim). We have also characterized the complex and dynamic structural architectural of the modular RPA protein as it engages this ssDNA template and have begun to address the quandary of how RPA releases the template to hand off to pol-prim. Once the primase subunits are loaded on the DNA template, an ~10 nt RNA is synthesized and the primed template is transferred to the pol ? subunits for extension to the final ~30 nt of RNA-DNA primer. Our goal is to continue to define the trajectory of actions on the template as it is replicated. The next phase of our research is to solve the fundamental mysteries about the release of RPA and loading of pol-prim onto the template, the counting of primer length by primase, and the hand-offs from primase to pol ? and in turn to pol ? or pol ?. Our NER research seeks to understand the mechanism of action of the human NER machinery, discern the biochemical bases for malfunctions caused by disease-associated mutations, and ultimately use this knowledge to help evaluate the potential of NER-targeted chemotherapies. NER requires the assembly of >20 proteins around the lesion to create a platform for positioning the two nucleases that cut out the damaged DNA. We have defined critical DNA binding characteristics of two core NER factors: XPA and XPC. Our current focus is on the scaffold that directs the assembly and spatial organization of this 'pre-incision' complex (PIC), which involves the dual action of XPA and RPA. The goal is to obtain structural understanding and functional validation of the interactions between XPA and RPA and their role as the PIC scaffold by: (i) determining the structure of XPA and RPA bound to a NER model substrate; (ii) investigating structure-based and disease- associated mutations in XPA in cell-based assays of the repair of DNA lesions and co-localization with other NER factors. From this scaffold, we will assemble and characterize relevant sub-complexes along the trajectory to the complete NER PIC."
"9405595","This proposal represents an application by the Mayo Clinic to be a REGIONAL CLINICAL CENTER (RCC) and a site for a CLINICAL RESEARCH SKILLS DEVELOPMENT CORE (SDC) in the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network (HFCRN). Mayo was a RCC and SDC site in the first funding period of the HFCRN. The Mayo RCC investigators designed and as serve as the principal investigator (PI) on two HFCRN trials (RELAX and ROSE) and three ancillary studies. We lead enrollment across the nine HFCRN sites. Our proposed protocol is POSE (Post-hospitalization Optimization Strategies Evaluation); a randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial of subcutaneous (SQ) administration of BNP added to standard therapy at hospital dismissal and continued for 30 days in patients admitted for acute heart failure syndrome (AHFS). Hypothesis: As compared to placebo, therapy with SQ BNP will be associated with greater clinical stability at 60 days post discharge as assessed by a composite HF stability score. The long-term goal of POSE is to provide the rationale for a future adequately powered phase III study to test the impact of this strategy on HF readmissions. POSE is a small proof-of-concept study which tests a innovative therapeutic strategy at a novel AHFS therapeutic window extending the time course of therapeutic interventions in AHFS into the vulnerable post-discharge period to promote further clinical stabilization. POSE targets the appropriate AHFS subgroup based on the pathophysiology of AHFS and the biological actions of the proposed therapeutic and uses a novel, highly quantitative composite endpoint reflecting clinical stability. Finally, we document the successes of the MAYO HFCRN CLINICAL RESEARCH SKILLS DEVELOPMENT CORE (SDC) in the first cycle of funding and outline our continued strategy to train academic HF physician scientists in our Mayo SDC application."
"9528914","PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to use a physiologically relevant animal model to define determinants of bacterial persistence during opportunistic infections occurring in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) is a common opportunistic pathogen in patients with COPD, and much evidence indicates that these infections might involve biofilms. We hypothesize that: i) biofilms are a determinant of Hi persistence in the lung during COPD-related infections, ii) bacterial infection with planktonic (non-biofilm) bacteria initiates inflammatory exacerbation and worsening of COPD disease, and iii) strains of Hi (and other bacterial opportunists) may differ in their capacity to initiate COPD exacerbations. In order to address these hypotheses, we will complete the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Define role(s) of biofilms in colonization/persistence of Hi within the lungs of smoke-  exposed ferrets. Specific Aim 2. Test impact of bacterial infection in inflammatory exacerbation and severity of COPD pathophysiology.  Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the means whereby bacteria persist during COPD disease, and the implications for these infections in the periodic changes in host responses that underlie exacerbations. The completion of the work outlined in this proposal will shed new light on chronic COPD-related bacterial infections and their implications for the management of this disease, which is among the leading public health problems worldwide."
"9456515","Project Summary/Abstract Dental workers, particularly less experienced examiners, are unable to accurately distinguish dysplastic or cancerous lesions of the oral mucosa needing treatment from benign oral lesions. Furthermore, variable stages of dysplasia to carcinoma occur within a single oral lesion, and dental workers often do not biopsy the site which contains the worst pathologic diagnosis to inform treatment as is ideal. The goal of this project is to develop an automated, optical imaging-based platform to promote early detection of cancer in community dental clinics. Its central hypothesis is that optical properties of dysplastic or cancerous oral epithelium can be measured and exploited to augment the ability of dental workers to diagnose these lesions. In particular, two imaging modalities used: 1) widefield autofluorescence imaging (AFI), which has high sensitivity but low specificity for dysplasia and cancer, and 2) high-resolution microendoscopy (HRME), which has a higher specificity but can only interrogate a <1 mm diameter of tissue at once. To achieve the objective, two specific aims will be completed. First, an automated, multimodal imaging early- detection platform that identifies high-risk sites within oral mucosal lesions using widefield images, then distinguishes dysplastic or cancerous lesions from benign lesions by combining HRME and widefield AFI features will be developed. To achieve this aim, an automated image analysis algorithm capable of identifying high-risk sites within oral lesions will be developed; this algorithm will then be combined with existing HRME software to create a single, integrated user interface for the platform. Second, the performance and clinical utility of the early-detection platform will be evaluated by performing a clinical study in 75 patients with oral mucosal lesions with low-prevalence of oral neoplasia (and high-prevalence of benign lesions) similar to community dental clinics. The ability of the early-detection platform to identify high-risk sites within a lesion and distinguish dysplastic or cancerous sites from benign sites will be compared to an expert clinician and dental workers. The clinical utility of the platform will be evaluated based on its ability to provide diagnostic information that improves the ability of dental workers to distinguish dysplastic or cancerous sites from benign sites. This research is significant because it will provide dental workers with an easy to use platform that promotes the early diagnosis of oral neoplasia, a critical step to reducing the global oral cancer burden, and may also reduce unnecessary diagnostic workup of low-risk lesions."
"9497217","PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians? ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours. We have assembled a superb team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry advisors with complementary expertise and strong track record of team science. We propose the following aims:1) to develop a streamlined BSI diagnostic protocol for integrated ID and AST; 2) to develop a microfluidic array chip that enables ID and AST with single-cell resolution; 3) to develop instrument and analysis programs for single- cell ID and AST; and 4) to demonstrate the single-cell diagnostic platform, we will perform analytical and pilot clinical validation studies."
"9411133","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is diagnosed by pulmonary function test (PFT). PFT is commonly used to evaluate the severity and therapeutic response in COPD. However, complex mixture of COPD phenotypes requires a diagnostic tool with abilities to evaluate broader aspects of lung pathophysiology, and this is the primary reason why PFTs do not provide sufficient correlation with disease status and progression to serve as a reliable surrogate endpoint. What is needed is a quantitative and comprehensive set of COPD biomarkers that can provide phenotyping and staging of COPD, rapid assessment of response to a broad range of therapies, and tracking the progression of disease. The hope is that the hyperpolarized xenon magnetic resonance imaging (HXe MRI) could diagnose and intervene patients at the earliest stages of COPD, guide the selection of appropriate therapies, and extend life. In this proposal, two HXe MRI assessments will be performed. (1) A single sequence that combines a high-resolution image of inhaled HXe with a proton image acquired in the same breath-hold will provide the fraction of the lung volume with compromised airflow. (2) A new imaging protocol that exploits xenon's chemical shift sensitivity to the separate tissue compartments of the lung allows a detailed mapping of gas exchange through lung tissue and into the red blood cells. We hypothesize that these HXe MRI signatures will access physiologic information that were previously inaccessible by the conventional PFT and multimodality CT of chest, (MDCT). We also hypothesize that these imaging signatures will enhance our ability to evaluate COPD phenotypes and disease status better than the PFT and MDCT. Higher HXe MRI resolution based on the anatomy of the lung will further enhance the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In aim 1, we will perform a study of the correlation of imaging signatures of COPD with conventional assessments (PFT, MDCT and clinical outcomes). In aim 2, we will evaluate changes in the lung physiology of the patients with well-characterized COPD after being serially treated with three standard COPD therapies, long acting muscarinic antagonist (umeclidinium) and long acting beta-agonist (vilanterol) to improve ventilation, and inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone) to potentially affect the inflammation in tissues. Our study design offers both cross-sectional and longitudinal information. Eighty treatment-nave subjects will be evaluated at baseline, after two serial 30-day courses of umeclidinium/vilanterol and fluticasone. The 320 assessments, considered independently, will determine correlations between functional imaging signatures and conventional metrics which include PFT, MDCT, and clinical outcomes. Within-subject temporal alterations of the HXe MRI imaging will be evaluated as potential biomarkers to assess COPD phenotypes and disease status, both of which we anticipate to deepen our basic mechanisms contributing to the genesis of COPD and to promote development of new strategies to diagnose and treat COPD."
"9613412","Project Summary The brain has the remarkable capability to change in response to experience. This plasticity is essential for learning and memory, and is an important feature of the auditory cortex, especially for learning the significance of sensory signals such as speech, for the use of devices such as cochlear implants, and for recovery after short- term deafness. These changes are thought to occur primarily at synapses, basic units of information processing and plasticity. Long-term synaptic plasticity requires sensory experience and activation of neuromodulatory systems which convey behavioral context to local cortical circuits. However, little is known about the interactions between synaptic inputs and release of neuromodulators in vivo, making it challenging to relate perceptual learning to plasticity in the auditory cortex or other brain areas. Recently we developed an approach to measuring dynamics of synaptic modifications for hours, coupled with imaging techniques enabling us to monitor the same cells over days during training, directly monitoring and manipulating activity in behaving mice. These approaches allow for a close examination of links between modulation, cortical plasticity and auditory perceptual learning.  Specifically, we will study how auditory perceptual training activates the cholinergic vs noradrenergic modulatory systems. These two modulators are principally involved in selective attention towards behaviorally- important stimuli, general arousal, and learning. However, there may be important functional differences in these systems in terms of when they are active during different phases of training or consequences of cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation on auditory neurons for contextual information processing. This proposal describes a series of imaging, recording, optogenetic, and behavioral experiments that will compare and contrast the effects of locus coeruleus activation and norepinephrine release vs the effects of nucleus basalis activation and cholinergic modulation on the primary auditory cortex of behaving mice. Many studies have highlighted the importance of recording in awake animals during behavior, and we will first examine how ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are affected by learning over the entire duration of training, as animals go from nave and poor performers, to having reliable performance on an auditory detection and recognition task we have used in the lab for years. Next, we determine when and how cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation affect behavioral and neural responses. Finally, we will make some of the first direct measurements of modulatory neuron responses, asking how these systems are activated by task-relevant variables such as sounds linked to reward.  In summary, here we use in vivo recording and imaging methods to ask how behavioral training engages and modifies noradrenergic and cholinergic systems, to collectively affect auditory cortical processing and persistently improve auditory perceptual abilities in behaving mice."

The BSSR is directed by Ms. Heather Hampel, who also is the OSUCCC Associate Director for Biospecimen Science. The BSSR is comprised of two arms: the first arm is for collection using a universal consenting and biobanking protocol that has been substantially modified and that was IRB-approved one year ago. It is modeled and named after the existing Total Cancer Care (TCC) protocol in place at Moffitt Cancer Center. The TCC protocol includes a broad informed consent allowing for access to pathologic and clinical data for life, with the ability to re-contact patients for clinical follow up and/or to offer participation in other clinical trials for which they are eligible. The collected tissues are stored at the BSSR biobank, located at OSU's Nationwide Children's Hospital Biopathology Center, which is both NCI funded and approved by the College of American Pathologists. During the first 11 months of the TCC protocol consenting process, 6,494 cancer patients have been consented, representing a 90% accrual rate for contacted subjects. There are 24,346 aliquots collected, and 2,050 paraffin-embedded tissues are available. The second arm of the BSSR provides prospectively procured biospecimens to OSUCCC investigators from all five OSUCCC research programs who are in need of pathology samples. The decision to distribute BSSR tissues is decided by committee who evaluates scientific merit, source of funding and availability. Researchers may receive samples and data with subject identifiers with prior IRB-approval, or de-identified and coded- limited data sets without additional prior IRB approvals. Over the past five-year period, the BSSR has provided 56 OSUCCC investigators with 17,617 prospectively-procured samples from 4317 subjects among 73 IRB protocols, and has contributed to 88 publications, including 8 in journals with an impact factor >10. Also, the BSSR provided services for prospective procurement to 2 SPORES, 10 R01s, 4 R21s, 3 U01s, 3 P01s, 2 K awards, and a T32. Future plans for BSSR are to complete the implementation of the TCC protocol in all of the OSUCCC's Disease Specific Research Groups, to reduce the number of IRB-approved banking protocols across the OSUCCC, to establish web-based consenting and electronic patient questionnaires, and to develop collaborative relationships with other NCI-designated CCC's for data sharing and enhancement of research. The BSSR leverages extensive institutional support and seeks only 9.3% support from CCSG funds. Biospecimen Services Shared Resource is part of the Clinical Grouping."
"9598711","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine a web-based personalized feedback intervention to reduce alcohol-related risky sexual behavior among underage young adult drinkers aged 18-20, which is theoretically informed by the Prototype Willingness Model. Based on literature focusing on developmentally appropriate health models for adolescents and young adults, the Prototype Willingness Model assumes two pathways to risk behavior: one pathway that is reasoned and one pathway that is socially based. Prior research has shown that interventions consistent with the Prototype Willingness Model, or interventions based on components of the Prototype Willingness Model, are efficacious at reducing alcohol use and risky sexual behavior. Despite the utility of this model, it has yet to be applied to examining whether interventions comprised of components from both pathways of the PW Model are efficacious at reducing alcohol-related risky sexual behavior in underage young adult drinkers. Moreover, no research has examined the active components (reasoned pathway vs. social pathway) of this model. The research proposed in this application is designed to evaluate a personalized feedback intervention, based on the Prototype Willingness Model, focused on alcohol-related risky sexual behavior through a longitudinal study in a national sample of young adults (college and non-college) recruited via social networking sites. To accomplish this objective the study will enroll a national sample of 1,200 young adults aged 18-20 and assess them at 3-, 6, 9-, and 12-months. We will evaluate the overall efficacy of the interventions based on the Prototype Willingness Model by comparing underage young adult drinkers randomly assigned to receive the reasoned-based pathway intervention (n=300), the social-based pathway intervention (n=300), or the integrated intervention based on the full PW Model (both pathways; n=300) to an attention control group (n=300). We will examine whether changes in components of both the reasoned and social pathways and drinking mediate intervention efficacy on reducing alcohol-related risky sexual behavior. Past behavior and college student status will be evaluated as moderators of intervention efficacy. The proposed study is both significant and innovative in that it will evaluate brief interventions among a national sample of young adults attending and not attending college, will utilize social networking sites for participant recruitment, and will test the efficacy of interventions based on individual and integrated pathways of the Prototype Willingness Model."
"9448878","Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy with a rapidly rising incidence in recent years. There are several major diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic challenges encountered currently in the management of this cancer. To overcome them needs the development of novel effective management strategies, which in turn relies on better understanding of molecular mechanisms of thyroid cancer. It has been well established that the PI3K/AKT pathway plays a fundamental role in thyroid tumorigenesis. Considerable success has been achieved in our lab in recent years on the research theme ?Molecular Events in the PI3K/AKT Pathway in Thyroid Cancer, particularly in characterizing the genetic and epigenetic molecular events in this pathway in thyroid cancer. To extend and bring this research to a new high level, we propose here to pursue a genome-wide search for novel tumor-promoting genes of thyroid cancer that are epigenetically controlled through aberrant methylation by the PI3K pathway and are among the fundamental molecular players in thyroid tumorigenesis. Based on our strong preliminary data we hypothesize that genome-wide aberrations in methylation and hence expression of important genes driven by the PI3K pathway is a fundamental mechanism in thyroid tumorigenesis; in this process many of such genes epigenetically controlled by the PI3K pathway are themselves novel tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that play an important role in thyroid tumorigenesis and represent novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic and prognostic molecular markers for thyroid cancer. In this context, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims on this project 1) To explore genome-wide CpG methylation alterations driven by the PI3K pathway and identify important genes epigenetically controlled, through such methylation alteration, by this pathway; 2) To test the oncogenic functions and roles of selected genes controlled epigenetically by the PI3K pathway and establish them as important candidate tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes in thyroid cancer; and 3) To test the clinical translational potential of the novel gene methylation markers identified for the diagnosis and prognostication of thyroid cancer. The project will be conducted using a recently upgraded comprehensive 850K CpG methylation microarray platform as well as our well-established high-throughput technical approaches and in vitro and in vivo experimental protocols. The proposed studies are in a research area of our strong expertise and will take advantage of our large thyroid biospecimen collection and clinicopathological database in achieving the study aims. This innovative proposal has a high potential to advance the field."
"9543109","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Engage is a novel therapy for late life depression, a disorder that worsens the outcomes of most medical illnesses, promotes disability, increases expense, and complicates medical care by clouding the clinical picture and undermining treatment adherence. Late-life depression has a modest response to pharmacotherapy, and although problem-solving therapy (PST) was found efficacious, it is rarely utilized by community clinicians. Engage targets behavioral domains of late-life depression grounded on neurobiological constructs using behavioral strategies of known efficacy selected for their simplicity. Reward exposure is the principal treatment vehicle of Engage. The first 3 sessions consist of direct reward exposure but the therapists search for barriers in 3 behavioral domains, i.e. negativity bias, apathy, and emotional dysregulation, and add strategies targeting these domains when needed. Engage uses a structured, stepped-care approach and makes personalization part of the treatment itself. The primary hypothesis of the study is that Engage is non-inferior to problem solving therapy (PST), a treatment with demonstrated efficacy in late life depression. Its secondary hypotheses postulate that Engage requires fewer training hours than PST, is non-inferior to PST in reducing disability and in inducing remission of depression. Exploratory analyses will focus on long-term efficacy of Engage (over 26 and 52 weeks) as well as mechanisms and predictors of its effects. The participants will be 300 (150 from each Center) older (>60 years) non-psychotic, non-demented persons with unipolar major depression who will be randomly assigned to 9 sessions of Engage or PST. We bring to this project two research groups with a history of a successful collaboration in 2 two-center R01 supported psychotherapy studies, complementary expertise in clinical biology, intervention development, clinical trials, and experience in directing multicenter studies. This application responds to two IOM reports, which predict that the workforce in geriatrics will be overwhelmed by the aging population, a problem that will reach cataclysmic proportions when the Affordable Care Programs come into being. Older adults seek services in community settings where the providers of initial care for depression are social workers and nurses without in-depth training in psychotherapies. Engage is designed for such clinicians and, therefore, may have broad scalability (used by many professionals) and reach by offering to many depressed seniors access to effective psychotherapy. The stepped approach to personalization used by Engage may make it applicable to other populations."
"9568362","?     DESCRIPTION:     Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is considered the signature injury of the recent US wartime conflicts, with approximately 15% of warfighters experiencing single or multiple mild TBIs (mTBI). PTSD is a frequent comorbidity in this population, with almost 35% of mTBI exposed Veterans reporting qualifying symptoms associated with their service in theater. A great deal of controversy remains over whether mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) contributes to the susceptibility for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or whether mTBI mechanistically underlies some aspects of presenting PTSD symptoms. There is a great deal of overlap in the symptomatology of mTBI and PTSD, suggesting that either a large subpopulation of mTBI exposures are also psychologically traumatic, or that there is an underlying biological substrate after single or multiple mTBIs that predisposes Veterans to PTSD or its associated symptoms. The presenting symptomatology of PTSD (i.e., emotion dysregulation and cognitive deficits) may have an underlying basis in the biomechanical disruption by TBI of the coordination of brain areas for emotional processing and memory. This same disruption may interfere with effective treatment, in particular prolonged exposure (PE), which incorporates an extinction paradigm. Animal models are necessary in order to unravel the effect of TBI on the brain circuitry underlying PTSD. We will therefore utilize the most biomechanically realistic model of diffuse brain injury, the porcine rotational acceleration model, in order to elucidate how mTBI affects the  circuitry underlying PTSD and the acquisition and extinction of PTSD-like behavioral phenotypes. We will utilize fear conditioning in order to produce a PTSD-like phenotype in swine. The limbic system, a group of brain regions involved in cognition, memory and processing of emotional salience, is highly linked via oscillatory activity between these networks.  Our central hypothesis is that diffuse TBI leads to a disruption within and between areas of the corticolimbic system, increasing dominance of the amygdala over other limbic structures and thus leading to a susceptibility to PTSD-like phenotypes and failure of extinction. TBI may also disrupt the very circuitry required to extinguish post-traumatic symptoms, and adversely affect sleep patterns involved in reconsolidation of memory. We will investigate the mechanisms underlying TBI- related PTSD symptoms and treatment resistance by examining neurophysiological changes in the cortico-limbic system and related behaviors, including sleep-wake architecture, after single and repetitive rotational acceleration injury. To accomplish these aims, swine will be injured repetitively (2x) at acceleration levels inducing mTBI, and then experiments will proceed at multiple time-points post-injury. Multiple electrode arrays that allow for extensive coverage of the cortico-limbic circuit will be implanted under anesthesia and monitored over a period of 3-4 weeks post-injury, during behavioral tasks dependent on cortico-limbic circuitry. Another group of animals will be fear conditioned post-injury in order to detect changes in fear acquisition (i.e., the development of a PTSD-like phenotype) post-TBI. Another group of animals will be fear-conditioned prior to injury so that the effect of subsequent injury (compared to sham injury) on the extinction of fear can be examined. As sleep disruption is a prominent overlapping symptom of PTSD and TBI, all animals, injured and sham injured will be monitored for changes in sleep-wake architecture. Rapid eye movement (REM) s eep macro- and microarchitecture will be examined as there is substantial evidence for REM sleep abnormalities in PTSD. In all experiments, sleep measures will be correlated with electrophysiological measures. The animals will then be sacrificed, and the electrophysiological findings correlated with histopathological analysis of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala and their connecting axonal tracts. The proposed studies will therefore assess the mechanism(s) underlying comorbid TBI and PTSD by examining the neurophysiological changes in the relevant cortico-limbic networks in a porcine model of diffuse brain injury."
"9456161","Project Summary/Abstract Tsetse flies transmit the human and animal forms of African Trypanosomiasis, neglected diseases, which affect marginalized populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Tsetse flies have a low reproductive capacity and low population numbers relative to other disease vectors as they reproduce by obligate viviparity (intrauterine larval development/nutrition and live birth). Trypanosomiasis is controlled primarily by vector control methods based upon pesticide-baited targets and traps to reduce tsetse populations. These strategies are effective, but have downsides, including pesticide associated toxicity and high implementation cost. Thus, improvement of the current control methods by increasing efficacy and reducing toxicity/associated costs as well as development of new strategies is desirable. This project will produce knowledge required for the development of control methods that exploit tsetse's unique reproductive biology and low reproductive capacity for vector control. Male seminal fluid proteins regulate important physiological and behavioral changes observed in mated female insects, including reduced receptivity to remating, increased blood meal volume, initiation of ovulation and morphological modifications to the female reproductive tract. Manipulation of the formation of the seminal secretions in males or the post-mating responses in the female has the potential to disrupt tsetse reproduction. The aims of this project will define the physiological, molecular and metabolic responses occurring in the female in response to mating/seminal secretion transfer as well as identify seminal biochemical compounds and their associated metabolic pathways. This study has 2 aims: 1. Characterize molecular and morphological changes associated with the female post-mating response. 2. Identify metabolites/pathways associated with male seminal secretions and metabolic changes in the female  associated with the post mating response."
"9390488","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular disease with rising prevalence and a high mortality rate. Current treatment is limited to open or endovascular surgery, a procedure for which only 10% of AAA patients are eligible, highlighting an urgent need for new mechanistic understandings of AAA. With a long term goal to identify new therapeutic targets for AAA, the current proposal will investigate the pathological roles of aldosterone (Aldo), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and high salt intake in AAA. Elevated plasma Aldo and high salt intake have been linked to a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases. MR antagonists have been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure. However, little is known of the roles of Aldo, MR, and high sal intake in AAA. Recently, the applicants discovered that administration of MR agonists, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) or Aldo to C57BL/6 male mice induced AAA in the presence of high salt. Importantly, DOCA- or Aldo-salt-induced AAA mimicked human AAA with respect to oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, smooth muscle cell (SMC) degeneration, metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, and elastin degradation. Treatment of mice with spironolactone or eplerenone, two clinically used MR antagonists, effectively attenuated DOC- or Aldo-salt-induced aortic aneurysm formation and rupture. Building on these exciting and novel findings, the applicants further demonstrated that, in isolated mouse aorta, administration of pathological plasma concentrations of Aldo and sodium activated MMP2 and induced oxidative stress, suggesting a direct pathological effect of Aldo and salt on aorta. Interestingly, denuding endothelial cells from isolated aorta had no effect on Aldo-salt-induced MMP2 activation and oxidative stress, indicating that MR in SMC (SMC-MR) is involved. Consistent with this concept, the applicants found that p47phox, a component of NADPH oxidase that has been implicated in human AAA, was markedly upregulated by Aldo-salt in the medial layer of abdominal aortic wall and co-localized with SMC a-Actin, which was completely abolished by treatment of mice with eplerenone. Moreover, treatment of mice with temporal, a free radical scavenger, diminished DOCA-salt-induced AAA. Therefore, the applicants hypothesize that increased plasma Aldo and salt activate SMC-MR and p47phox and thus result in oxidative stress, MMP activation, vascular inflammation, SMC degeneration, and elastin degradation, thereby contributing to AAA. Three specific aims are: 1) test the hypothesis that SMC-MR is required for Aldo-salt-induced AAA; 2) define the mechanism by which SMC-MR targets p47phox to induce AAA; 3) determine whether targeting the Aldo/MR/salt axis is effective for treatment of AAA. To achieve these aims, genetic animal models (SMC- specific MR knockout mice and global p47phox knockout mice) and various molecular, biochemical, and physiopathological approaches will be used. If proposed studies are successful, they will have a profound impact on current basic researches and clinical practices on the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of AAA."

With this application we propose a new leadership structure, a multiple PI/PD partnership with Tufts Medical Center (Tufts MC) under the direction of Dr. Marvin Konstam, and a major expansion of the RCC. We believe that this expansion will markedly enhance both our scientific contribution to the Network and our enrollment capabilities. As our clinical trial, we propose to study the effects of ranolazine in patients with heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF). About 50% of HF patients have a normal EF. There are currently no evidence-based treatments for HFNEF. We have published in vitro studies using excitable left ventricular (LV) myocardial strips obtained from patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting which show that the presence of concentric LV hypertrophy (LVH), which is common in patients with HFNEF, is associated with the appearance of increasing diastolic tension at abnormally low stimulation frequencies. We have also shown that the anti-anginal drug ranolazine, which inhibits the late sarcolemmal Na current, normalizes this rate-dependent diastolic dysfunction. Accordingly, we propose a 24 week randomized trial of ranolazine versus placebo in patients with HFNEF and LVH to test the hypothesis that ranolazine improves exercise performance, assessed as peak V02 during either treadmill or cycle exercise. Secondary outcome variables include results of a symptom questionnaire, submaximal exercise performance, and changes in LV mass, diastolic function, and serum biomarkers of neurohumoral activation. A positive result of this trial would lay the foundation for a larger, mor definitive trial of ranolazine in treating the very difficult problem of HFNEF.     RELEVANCE (See instructions): HF has become a problem of major proportions over the last two decades. Important strides have been made in improving functional capacity and survival in HF with reduced ejection fraction. However, progress in the approximately 50% of patients with normal ejection fraction has been disappointing. The proposed trial, along with expansion of our RCC, has the potential to positively impact this major clinical problem."
"9480413","Abstract (Shepherd and Shaw, R01, Statistical methods for correlated outcome and covariate errors in studies of HIV/AIDS) There is growing interest in using administrative electronic health record (EHR) data and other routinely collected data sources as cost-effective means to support HIV/AIDS research. Validation of observational cohort and EHR data demonstrate the substantial presence of errors in these types of data. There may be errors in failure and censoring times (e.g., time from ART initiation to clinical events), event classifications, and covariates (e.g., CD4 at ART initiation), with strong correlation between the magnitudes of errors in these variables. These correlated errors can bias estimation. Ideally, researchers could validate a subsample of their data and use information learned from this subsample to improve estimation for the entire cohort, thereby obtaining valid estimates without validating the entire database. However, the current lack of available methods and software to correct for these types of errors for time-to-event outcomes are major barriers to performing correct inference on these types of data. There is also little guidance on what records and variables to validate to optimize resources. This project will create novel statistical methods for estimation to reduce or eliminate bias caused by correlated errors in failure-time outcomes and associated covariates. The developed methods will use information on the structure of the measurement error, gained by data validation or audit subsets, to adjust estimation and correct for errors that remain in the unvalidated data. The project will develop and examine extensions of regression calibration, corrected scores, and multiple imputation methods, augmented with raking techniques to address these correlated errors. The project will also develop efficient data validation and audit sampling designs that use adaptive, multi-wave sampling in order to target successive validation and audit subsets towards informative subgroups of patients. Open source tools will be developed to allow researchers to implement these methods and study designs. The methods and designs will be applied to data from the International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) to estimate the incidence of tuberculosis and Kaposi's sarcoma and their outcomes, risk factor associations, and temporal trends among persons living with HIV in East Africa and Latin America."
"9390874","PROJECT-002 - LEUKEMIA RESEARCH PROGRAM (LR)  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The Leukemia Research (LR) Program within The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center  (OSUCCC) is co-led by two physician scientists; Drs. John C. Byrd and Michael R. Grever who bring together  34 peer-reviewed funded members from 9 Departments and 5 Colleges (Engineering, Pharmacy, Medicine,  Veterinary Medicine, and Arts & Sciences). The program is focused on the etiology, pathogenesis, prognosis,  and treatment of leukemia with emphasis on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), human T-cell lymphotrophic virus l  (HTLV-1) leukemia, large granular lymphocyte leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia  (CLL). LR Program-wide seminars, retreats, and disease-specific meetings provide an avenue for interaction  among scientists and physicians to improve the quality of scientific discovery made through research. The LR  Program integrates the use of novel technologies and translational and clinical support personnel provided  through OSUCCC shared resources to facilitate impactful discoveries that ultimately have the potential to  change the lives of patients with leukemia. LR Program discoveries span diagnostics through therapeutics,  many of which are actively tested in both investigator initiated clinical trials and also NCI sponsored Phase I  and II as well as cooperative group trials where our members have prominent leadership roles.  The Specific Aims of LR Program include: 1) to integrate genetic, epigenetic, RNA/protein, non-coding RNAs,  biochemical and immunosuppressive features of leukemic cells in order to enhance risk stratification and target  identification; and 2) to foster preclinical and clinical development of epigenetic, targeted molecular, and  immunologic therapeutics directed at the causes of leukemic transformation and progression.  LR Program members have published 557 manuscripts of which 48% are inter-programmatic, 53% are intra-  programmatic, 61% are multi-institutional; total collaborative publications are 93%. The Program has $8.7M in  annual direct costs of peer-reviewed funding of which $6.1M (70%) is from the NCI, including strong  programmatic funding in basic, translational, and clinical research. With regard to translational research, in five  years the LR Program members have accrued 1,660 patients to interventional clinical trials, 100% of which  were therapeutic accruals, and of those, 989, or 60%, were placed on investigator-initiated trials. Of the 1,660  patients accrued, 1,495 or 90% were on Phase I/II trials. LR Program members have led the development of  two therapeutic agents (ibrutinib and idelalisib) that were recently FDA approved for leukemia. Additionally, LR  Program members have developed two novel diagnostic tests that are now utilized in clinical practice. Our  future plans consist of targeted recruitment, continued enhancement of collaborative efforts, better molecular  classification of both AML and CLL for improvement in targeted therapies, and moving a number of preclinical  and clinical observations onto novel clinical trials."
"9463397","Project Summary  Over $50 billion is spent annually in the US treating chronic, non-healing wounds, many of which face life- threatening complications due to infections. Wound infections are difficult to treat due to the frequency of antibiotic resistance as well as the formation of biofilms, a community of bacteria covered by an extracellular polymeric substance. Biofilm-related infections can result in a substantial increase in bacterial tolerance and resistance to antibiotics compared to their planktonic phenotype. Given the issues of resistance, the complex nature of biofilms, and poor clinical outcomes associated with chronic wounds, it is urgent that alternative treatments be developed to address the bacterial protective mechanisms that maintain these difficult-to-treat infections.  Arrevus is pioneering a novel approach to provide an effective treatment option for chronic wound infections through the development of Designer Proline-rich Antimicrobial peptide Chaperone protein inhibitors (DPCs). ARV-1501, Arrevus? lead DPC, kills bacteria in two distinct ways; i) by disrupting the bacterial lipid membrane and ii) by selectively inhibiting the chaperone protein DnaK. DnaK is a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved prokaryotic heat shock protein critical for bacterial survival in stress conditions and is associated with bacterial biofilm formation. Preliminary studies show that ARV-1501: 1) has anti-infective capabilities both alone and in combination with other small molecule antibiotics; 2) can re-sensitize multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria to antibiotics; 3) does not exhibit off-target binding to the human homolog (Hsp70); and 4) has reduced bacterial load and enhanced healing in several wound infection models.  In this Phase I STTR, Arrevus will obtain proof-of-concept data to support the use of ARV-1501 as a therapeutic option for treating multidrug resistant wound infections. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the in vitro efficacy of ARV-1501 alone and in combination with clinically relevant antibiotics against MDR S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, two microbes commonly associated with wound infections. In Aim 1A, we will determine the antimicrobial efficacy, and in Aim 1B, we will determine the anti-biofilm activity. In Aim 2, we will assess the anti- biofilm and antimicrobial capabilities of ARV-1501 alone and in combination with a clinically-utilized antibiotic using the rabbit ear wound model, in collaboration with Robert Galiano, M.D. (Northwestern University). The rabbit ear model is clinically relevant and will allow us to determine the anti-biofilm properties of ARV-1501 alone (Aim 2A) and in combination with a synergistic antibiotic determined in Aim 1 (Aim 2B).  Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide the necessary efficacy data to support further development of ARV-1501 as a therapeutic agent for treating wound infections in Phase II. Development of an ARV-1501/antibiotic treatment for chronic wound infections has the potential to provide an alternative strategy to address these hard-to-treat infections and enhance patient outcomes."
"9566418","Abstract Current guidelines for diabetes care recommend individualized treatment plans for complex patients since tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate. However, little evidence exists to support the patient-centered decisions. Electronic health records (EHRs) provide an important source for clinical evidence on improving diabetes care, but suffer from usability deficiencies. Particularly the lab measures and vital signs have intermittent missing values where the irregular visit patterns may be informative about the patients' underlying medication status. Patient characteristics are also incomplete due to linkage error. We aim to impute the missing values in EHRs and improve the data quality to strengthen the evidence base for diabetes guidelines. The proposed work is motivated by ongoing clinical research to examine the role of patient complexity in the relationship between tight A1c control and the risk of adverse events, using a pre-existing EHR dataset of 8,304 patients with diabetes cared by the UW Health during 2003-2011. We propose Bayesian latent profile models under multiple imputation to account for the potentially non-ignorable visiting process, facilitate modeling a large number of EHR variables of mixed types and develop scalable computation algorithms. Specifically, first we build latent profiles by jointly modeling A1c values, patient characteristics and health outcomes. Second, we generalize the latent profiles by multiple pattern indices and combine the trajectories of multiple lab measures and vital signs with intermittent missing values, as well as accounting for incomplete patient sociodemographics. Third, we release open source computation software and disseminate new clinical findings to the healthcare delivery system. The investigation results will advance statistical methodology development for missing data in longitudinal studies, increase the compatibility of available patient medical records and strengthen the evidence base to support existing diabetes guidelines."
"9429441","PROJECT ABSTRACT This application is for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award entitled ?Microbiome-based diagnosis of pneumonia in the acute respiratory distress syndrome?. I am a Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Fellow at the University of Pittsburgh and I require additional training to develop expertise as a translational researcher in the microbiome of critical illness. The central objective of my research is to utilize emerging microbial DNA sequencing techniques for faster and more accurate diagnosis of pneumonia in critically-ill patients. The focus of my research is the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a serious form of inflammatory lung injury often caused by pneumonia and accounting for 10% of intensive care unit admissions in the US with 40% mortality. With diagnostic limitations of the current standard- of-care of microbial cultures, patients often receive empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotics that can be inappropriate or inadequate for their individual needs, and also promote antibiotic resistance ? a major public health threat. My preliminary data demonstrate feasibility and proof-of-concept that sequencing of microbial DNA directly from patient samples can lead to faster and more accurate diagnosis of pneumonia compared to cultures. The aims of the study are to develop sequencing-based definitions for pneumonia in (1) culture- positive and (2) culture-negative patients by integrating microbiome and host response data, and then 3) to assess the anticipated impact of sequencing on antibiotic selection. I will execute a prospective cohort study in patients with ARDS and use modern culture-independent sequencing techniques and computational biology methods to study the lung microbiome in relation to host-responses and microbiologic cultures. The proposed sequencing-based approach has the potential to improve accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis (capturing both cultivable and non-cultivable organisms) and to provide information to clinicians much faster than cultures. Thus, my proposal addresses a high priority issue for development of innovative diagnostics of infections to improve antibiotic usage and provides a unique translational training opportunity. I propose a research- intensive period of career development with hands-on and didactic training in advanced sequencing techniques, bioinformatics, computational biology and clinical trial design and implementation. The work will be conducted within the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, which has an outstanding record of training physician-scientists and a highly-developed infrastructure for the conduct of translational studies. I am supported by a committed mentoring partnership with convergent expertise in microbiome and critical care research, and a diverse Mentoring Advisory Committee. With support from the K23 Mentored Career Development Award, I will develop an independent project examining sequencing-based pneumonia diagnostics for an R01 proposal over the next five years."
"9390871","CORE-018: PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS)  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The Protocol Review and Monitoring System [PRMS] of the OSUCCC consists of a Clinical Scientific Review  Committee [CSRC] that reviews all new cancer-related clinical protocols for scientific merit prior to IRB  submission and monitors the scientific progress of ongoing studies including accrual rates. The main CSRC is  organized into two teams (with highly similar composition) that collectively meet twice monthly (each once per  month), facilitating rapid protocol review. The CSRC consists of 37 members representative of all the  OSUCCC research programs and includes clinical and basic researchers, biostatisticians, pharmacists, and  research nurses. Additionally, members with specific expertise in the areas of cancer prevention and control as  well as pediatrics are convened as CSRC sub-committees to provide focused review of these protocols. At its  twice monthly meetings, the main CSRC performs full scientific reviews of all cancer-related clinical protocols  initiated by local investigators or pharmaceutical industry sponsors and acknowledges NIH peer-reviewed  studies. Each CSRC member is expected to be present at each scheduled meeting, and a majority of the  voting members scheduled to be at a meeting must be present to attain a quorum for the meeting. Failure to  achieve a quorum at a meeting precludes any business being conducted. In addition to achieving quorum,  appropriate reviewer expertise must be present in order for business to be conducted. CSRC approval of a  protocol is required prior to its review by the OSU Cancer Institutional Review Board. Each protocol is reviewed  by four CSRC members (a primary reviewer, a secondary reviewer, a biostatistician, and a pharmacist).  Reviewers follow a written review template that calls for an analysis of the scientific hypothesis and rationale,  experimental design, patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment plan, statistical plan, pharmacy  considerations and proper prioritization. As of January 2009, all new research protocols undergo concurrent  review by the CSRC Logistics Review Committee (LRC), which is a sub-committee of the CSRC. The LRC was  implemented to facilitate trial activation and confirm proper research prioritization. The LRC does not evaluate  the scientific aspects of the protocol, but does evaluate the availability of the resources necessary to  successfully implement and complete the research protocol. The CSRC Executive Committee (EC) provides  oversight to the CSRC. It is led by the CSRC Chair. The EC consists of eight CSRC members that meet  monthly to review protocol accrual and scientific progress and ensure that protocol prioritization rules are  followed. The CSRC EC is responsible for communication with investigators whose clincial trials are not  meeting their accrual goals and providing support to facilitate accrual. The CSRC adheres to a set of well-  defined criteria for accrual monitoring and trial prioritization. Those ongoing studies that do not show adequate  accrual or fail to meet accepted standards of quality control based on formal audits are terminated. In 2014, the  CSRC closed 18 trials for low accrual. The EC also performs expedited reviews for appropriate studies (e.g.,  retrospective studies). In the last year (12/1/13 to 11/30/14), 199 new protocols were reviewed by the CSRC  with the following dispositions: 68 (34%) were approved as written, 55 (28%) were approved with stipulations,  14 (7%) were deferred, 57 (29%) were administratively acknowledged after having undergone previous NIH  peer-review, and 5 (2%) were disapproved. Twenty-eight non-interventional protocols were also  administratively approved by the CSRC EC."
"9564286","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts connections between the brain and spinal cord, causing devastating loss of mobility and independence. Most injuries are incomplete (iSCI), leaving intact at least some neural pathways to motor neurons that control movement. Although spontaneous plasticity in these spared pathways underlies some functional recovery, the extent of spontaneous recovery after iSCI is slow, variable and frustratingly limited. There is a critical need for new therapies that induce further improvements in persons with chronic iSCI. We recently demonstrated that repetitive exposure to acute intermittent hypoxia (rAIH), alone or in combination with walking training, stimulates motor recovery in persons with chronic iSCI. As an early stage investigator, I now propose to test four hypotheses concerning mechanisms of rAIH-induced motor recovery using multiple experimental approaches, including muscle electromyography, measurements of walking dynamics and leg strength, genotyping and pharmacological intervention. In Aim 1, we will focus on the neuromechanical bases of improved walking after rAIH, including increased motor gain (muscle activity) and coordination, as well as, reduced step-by-step variability. In Aim 2, we will test whether the functional benefits of rAIH when combined with training (strength or walking) are task-specific. We hypothesize that the cellular mechanisms that underlie the benefits of rAIH (alone or combined with training) in respiratory and non- respiratory motor function in rodent models applies also to humans with chronic, iSCI. Since AIH induces spinal motor plasticity in rats by a mechanism that requires serotonin-dependent synthesis of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in Aim 3, we will explore the BDNF-dependence of rAIH-induced motor recovery by assessing the impact of extent of functional recovery in individuals with bdnf polymorphisms known to undermine spinal BDNF function in humans. Finally, concurrent activation of competing cellular cascades during AIH (initiated by serotonin and adenosine, respectively) undermines respiratory motor plasticity in rats. By removing the adenosine-dependent mechanism, greater functional plasticity can be achieved. Thus, in Aim 4, we hypothesize that, by pharmaceutically removing the adenosine constraint on rAIH-induced spinal plasticity via caffeine administration, the therapeutic efficacy of rAIH will improve, increasing its potential asa viable treatment to improve motor function. Each aim is supported by substantial preliminary data, suggesting that the proposed experiments will advance our understanding of mechanisms giving rise to rAIH-induced motor recovery after iSCI. An important goal guiding our research is to identify ways to optimize rAIH-induced plasticity, thereby promoting meaningful functional recovery in persons with chronic iSCI."
"9422603","Abstract Directed cell migration is important in many normal and pathological processes including embryogenesis, wound healing, and tumor progression. The tensed actomyosin stress fiber (SF) network is largely responsible for generating contractile forces to establish the cell structures and shape needed for polarized migration. Over the past ten years, the field has classified SFs into three subpopulations, each differing in their connections to focal adhesions, molecular composition, and localization in a migrating cell. However, it is unclear how the mechanical properties of individual SFs in each of the subpopulations contribute to maintaining cell shape, tension, and migration. Furthermore, much of the existing knowledge on SFs has been indirectly inferred from observational studies of cells cultured on idealized two-dimensional substrates, which are not representative of the in vivo tissue microenvironment. In this fellowship proposal, I will study the mechanical properties of single SFs in each subpopulation and their contribution to generating tension to maintain cell shape and migration. I will address this in two aims, using several powerful biophysical tools. In Aim 1, I will investigate the mechanical properties of individual SFs by using femtosecond laser nanosurgery to sever single SFs to conduct loss-of-function studies. I will use fluorescence microscopy to examine changes in the redistribution of the tension released by the severed SF to the surrounding cytoskeletal network. Furthermore, I will also examine the traction forces exerted onto the extracellular matrix by each of the stress fiber subpopulations using model-based traction force microscopy. In Aim 2, I will investigate the role of the stress fiber subpopulations in cells cultured in polyacrylamide microchannels, which have been shown previously to capture important features of confined invasive migration in vivo. I am interested in studying how these complex environments affect stress fiber subpopulation formation. I will also repeat the laser nanosurgery and traction force experiments outlined in Aim 1 in cells cultured in these microchannels. Finally, I will compare the roles of the stress fiber subpopulations in both the idealized 2D substrates in Aim 1 and the microchannels in Aim 2. Through these studies, I hope to enhance the field?s understanding of how the actin cytoskeleton regulates tension and cell shape for directed migration."
"9465122","Project summary The 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa, caused by the Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV), resulted in over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths. This has been a sobering reminder of the growing threat of the filoviruses for global public health. Driven by the unprecedented dimension of this outbreak, most of the efforts to develop vaccines against the different species of ebolaviruses has been focused on EBOV. However, other ebolavirus species such as Sudan virus (SUDV) and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) have also caused sizable outbreaks in the past 20 years and the species causing future EVD outbreaks cannot be predicted. The vaccines currently in development, including adenovirus-based vaccines and VSV-ZEBOV that was successfully tested in a Phase III clinical trial in Africa, are specific to EBOV and do not provide cross protection against SUDV or BDBV. A major obstacle for elicitation of broadly neutralizing responses is the fact that most conserved regions of the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP), including the receptor binding site (RBS), are largely concealed on the viral surface. Using a special immunogen cocktail we have recently isolated several broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs), characterized their epitopes in collaboration with Integral Molecular, and for the first time, identified a cocktail of two antibodies that simultaneously protects against EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV. This body of knowledge can now be exploited to develop a single vaccine that protects against all ebolaviruses. Our proposal is based on two key and novel observations. i) We have identified several residues in the base of the EBOV GP trimer that, when mutated, increase the exposure of broadly neutralizing epitopes on the apical face of GP, including the RBS that is otherwise largely concealed. We have also demonstrated that immunization with such mutants broadens the antibody response towards SUDV and BDBV. ii) We have demonstrated that a proteolytically remodeled form of GP representing the post-entry form of GP in the host endosomes binds to the most potent bNAbs with very high affinity, suggesting that this ?cleaved GP? (GPCL) can be a candidate pan- ebolavirus vaccine. Building upon these observations, this Phase I project is designed in three specific Aims. In Aim 1, using the information gained from our extensive alanine scanning mutagenesis studies, a variety of mutants will be generated on the backbone of VSV-EBOV GP pseudotype virus, and their ability to elicit broadly neutralizing responses will be evaluated. Aim 2 focuses on generation and functional testing of immunogens based on GPCL. Additional specific mutations identified in Aim 1 will be incorporated into GPCL immunogen and evaluated in immunogenicity studies. In Aim 3, the best candidates identified in Aims 1 and 2 will be tested in proof of concept efficacy studies in murine challenge models of EBOV and SUDV. Upon successful proof of concept, we anticipate a phase II to demonstrate efficacy of the vaccine against EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV in non-humane primate models of infection as well as initiation of IND enabling studies."
"9384753","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing evidence demonstrates that cancer cells from solid tumors are highly heterogeneous, but it has been challenging to identify and to isolate those extremely tumorigenic tumor-repopulating cells as surface marker methods have been proven to be unreliable and their effectiveness has been controversial. During the last funding cycle, we developed a novel mechanical method of selecting and growing a subpopulation of cancer cells from melanoma cells using a soft fibrin matrix and demonstrated that they are highly tumorigenic in wild-type syngeneic and even nonsyngeneic mice. In this competitive renewal, we propose to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of how forces regulate gene expression, which is crucial in elucidating force-induced differentiation of highly tumorigenic tumor-repopulating cells. Our preliminary results suggest that epigenetic changes of H3K9 methylation levels are a link between force and Sox2 expression in the tumor-repopulating cells. We further show that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity is high in self-renewing tumor-repopulating cells but low in invading tumor-repopulating cells in the soft 3D matrix, that FAK activity in the cytoplasm and H3K9 methylation in the nucleus is inversely associated, and that silencing FAK leads to H3K9 methylation and inhibition of self-renewal of tumor-repopulating cells. Importantly, a local force of physiologic magnitudes via integrins on the cell surface is shown to be able to unfold chromatin segments and induce gene expression, suggesting a direct force-propagating pathway for gene expression in a live cell. Built on these preliminary results, we propose 3 specific aims to elucidate mechanotransduction mechanisms in the living cell: Aim 1: To elucidate how a surface force regulates methylation of H3K9 and self-renewal gene expression in tumor- repopulating cells; Aim 2: To elucidate how FAK activity and H3K9 methylation are regulated in TRC growth; Aim 3: To determine how a surface force alters gene expression in the nucleus of a cell. Our preliminary results support the feasibility of all 3 aims. We will employ several bioengineering approaches to apply forces to the living cell, and combine FRET technology, 3D imaging, BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) transgene techniques to visualize, to quantitate, and to map mechanotransduction processes in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of the living cell. The long term goal is to understand how forces and mechanical microenvironment in the 3D matrix regulate expression of self-renewing genes and differentiation genes, fundamental in elucidating how highly tumorigenic tumor-repopulating cells sustain self-renewal in soft low-force microenvironment."
"9406983","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We are grateful for the constructive comments and suggestions from the prior review to improve this application. The overall objective of this resubmission study (R01NR014846) is to conduct a population-level 3-waves longitudinal investigation of 300 adult children caregivers in order to quantify the relations between intergenerational solidarity and needs for caregivers of Chinese older adults with significant cognitive impairment. More specifically, we will conduct three waves of data collection and employ mixed effects models to examine three primary objectives: 1) Quantify the relations between intergenerational solidarity to the trajectory of caregivers' psychological distress; 2) Quantify the relations between intergenerational solidarity and caregivers' preparedness; 3) Quantify the relations between intergenerational solidarity and caregiver's help seeking behaviors in providing care for Chinese older adults with significant cognitive impairment. Our secondary objectives are to: 4) examine the gender differences in the above aims 1-3; and 5) explore the barriers, challenges, and cultural variations in adult children's expectation and adherence of intergenerational solidarity in providing care for Chinese older adults with cognitive impairment.  Despite the rapid growth of Chinese populations, there is great paucity in our current understanding of caregivers' needs for Chinese older adults with significant cognitive impairment. Due to cultural beliefs, many families believe dementia is a form of mental illness. The word dementia (F) literally translates into two characters: Crazy and Catatonic. The stigma, shame and negative responses experienced by patients and families interfere with their willingness to seek appropriate medical care. This marked gap in our knowledge is further exacerbated by the linguistic and cultural complexities and nuances when studying these issues. Moreover, there has been inadequate community support necessary to empower the Chinese community to be fully engaged as equal partners in research on culturally sensitive issues. Accordingly, we will leverage principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR) to quantify the relationship between important cultural factors and caregiving needs for Chinese older adults with cognitive impairment. In this application, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator and an experienced multi-institutional interdisciplinary team will build on our prior NIH funded CBPR projects to collaborate with Chicago Chinese community groups. The findings from this proposal will inform clinician, investigator, community, social services and policy makers to: a) identify risk/protective factors; b) better understand pathways for addressing caregiver needs; c) inform future prevention and intervention studies; and d) inform the practice and policy to improve health and wellbeing in caregiver populations."
"9510176","PROJECT SUMMARY   The hallmark pathophysiology of typical pertussis is severe paroxysmal coughing (whooping cough) persisting for weeks after initial onset. In young infants, the disease can be more severe and sometimes fatal. Neither antibiotics nor anti-tussive cough medications have any beneficial effect for individuals suffering from pertussis, and in the face of increasing pertussis epidemics, novel therapies are needed. In the mouse model, Bordetella pertussis infection is characterized by marked lung inflammatory pathology peaking at 2-3 weeks post-inoculation, but overt pertussis symptomology cannot be studied in this model since mice do not cough (to any stimulus). In a recently developed non-human primate model of pertussis, young baboons experimentally infected with B. pertussis develop classic symptoms of pertussis, including prolonged paroxysmal coughing. The baboon model therefore provides the possibility to test hypotheses on disease etiologies and identify potential therapies related to the pathophysiology of pertussis.  In our recent work in mice, we have investigated sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor- targeting drugs for their anti-inflammatory effects in B. pertussis-infected lungs. S1P is a phosphorylated sphingolipid that binds and signals through five receptors. Treatment with exogenously administered S1P receptor-targeting drugs can attenuate pulmonary inflammatory pathology in mouse models of LPS- induced acute lung injury and influenza virus infection. We found that intranasal treatment of B. pertussis-infected adult mice with S1P receptor-targeting drugs at therapeutic time points significantly reduced lung inflammatory pathology, the best measure of pertussis disease in these animals.  In this proposal, we aim to investigate the therapeutic potential of the S1P receptor-targeting drug FTY720 for treatment of pertussis in experimentally infected baboons. FTY720 (Fingolimod) is an approved drug in humans for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, and other S1P receptor- targeting drugs have gone through phase III clinical trials, demonstrating the translational potential of this approach. This work may therefore identify a drug that can be repurposed for treatment of pertussis. To test the hypothesis that administration of FTY720 to experimentally infected baboons will significantly reduce pertussis disease, we will compare the effectiveness of aerosol administration versus oral delivery of the drug (the latter is used in humans) to 6-9-month-old baboons, which manifest typical pertussis symptoms, as well as compare the effectiveness of drug administration versus antibiotic treatment. In addition, by analyzing lung inflammation in these animals, we will be able to test the hypothesis that lung inflammatory pathology (as also seen in infected mice) is associated with the severe cough symptomology of pertussis."
"9408449","Project Summary Abstract Recent studies indicate that physical exercise exerts benefits on cognitive health, at least in part, through effects on hippocampal neurogenesis. Other lines of investigation indicate that physical exercise is essential for the optimum health, differentiation, and tissue integration of therapeutic stem cell implants. The current proposal is focused on assessing the potential ability of this compound, BCI-838, to mimic and/or potentiate the proneurogenic and procognitive effects of physical exercise when studied in either the ?A? oligomer only? model and a MAPT P301L model of tauopathy. Developing effective treatments for both cerebral amyloidosis and cerebral tauopathy is considered to be within the mission of the RRD section of VA ORD. In order to assess the potential ability of a Group II mGluR antagonist (BCI-838) to mimic and/or potentiate the proneurogenic and procognitive effects of physical exercise, Dutch mutant APPE693Q ?A? oligomer only? mice and MAPTP301L tauopathy mice will be undergo 3 mo treatment with either (i) voluntary exercise only, (ii) proneurogenic drug treatment only (Group II mGluR antagonist, BCI-838), or (iii) both. The treated mice will undergo behavioral tests to assess their cognitive performance and anxiety levels. After finishing behavioral tests, their hippocampi will be used for an assay of neurogenesis and RNAseq assay of transcriptome. Because of the implication of BDNF in exercise-stimulated neurogenesis, we will also analyze each type of mouse (wildtype, A? oligomer, tauopathy) for drug or exercise response after crossing with either (i) a floxed/conditional Ntrk2(also known as trkB)-/- mouse or (iii) a floxed/conditional Ntrk2F616A. The mouse is engineered such that all trkB signaling is acutely abolished following oral treatment with the drug NMPP1. Together, the floxed trkB-/- and the floxed Ntrk2F616A provide scenarios of chronic and acute deficiencies, respectively, of trkB signaling. The floxed Ntrk2F616Awill also ensure that trkB signaling is abrogated in all relevant cells. A third option for depleting the hippocampus of trkB is the injection of AAV-trkB siRNA. The results of these studies could inform a novel approach to neurodegenerative diseases aimed at stimulating hippocampal neurogenesis, through the use of physical exercise, mGluR antagonists, trkB modulators, or some combination of two or more of these. Such an approach could address a major unmet need among the over 500,000 Veterans now living with dementia.

Paskett, PhD, MSPH and Mary Ellen Wewers, RN, PHD, MPH, has 52 members from 19 OSU  departments within the OSU Colleges of Medicine, Public Health, Arts and Sciences, Law, Nursing, Education  and Human Ecology, Dentistry, and Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, as well as Nationwide  Children's Hospital and Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Program members provide a wealth of behavioral,  basic, clinical, policy, outcomes, and social scientific knowledge and expertise not only to the CC Program, but  to the OSUCCC as a whole. The overall CC Program goal is to conduct research to reduce the incidence,  mortality and morbidity of cancer, which is accomplished by employing a transdisciplinary research team  approach. The Specific Aims of the CC Program are to: 1) Identify molecular, genetic, and behavioral factors  related to cancer incidence and mortality; 2) Develop and test behavioral interventions to prevent or detect  cancer early; and, 3) Assess and intervene on issues of cancer survivorship. An additional developing aim of  the CC Program is to address policy in relation to cancer prevention, detection, and care. Within these aims,  research focuses on cross-cutting themes including underserved/minority populations within our catchment  area, communication research, tobacco use and toxicity (including regulatory science), and behavioral  strategies that capitalize on our members' strengths, such as epidemiology, biology and behavior. The  program now has 2 NCI P50-funded Centers, both showcasing not only our multi-level focus but also the  transition from observational to interventional studies. In addition, many of our interventions, e.g., Patient  Navigation and Bio-Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Stress after Breast Cancer, have been incorporated into  clinical care. Moreover, our research has contributed to policy changes, most notably the establishment of a  smoke-free campus at OSU. During this past funding period (2009 - 2014), the Program members published a  total 611 articles in peer-reviewed journals of which 32% have intra-programmatic collaboration, 20% have  inter-programmatic collaborations, and 404 (66%) of the publications represent multi-institutional  collaborations. Many of these publications fall within each of these categories bringing the total collaborative  publications to 85%. CC Program funding stands at $6.8M of which $6.2M is peer-reviewed funding and of  that, $3.9M (63%) is NCI funding. CC Program investigators have enrolled 9,205 participants to research  studies over the last 5 years, 64% to externally peer-reviewed studies and 34% to institutional studies, 1.2% to  cooperative trial group studies and 0.8% to industry studies. Of these, 6,964 (76%) were enrolled on  interventional studies and 2,241 (24%) on non-interventional studies. Future goals focus on increasing  research in: 1) policy, allowing us to take advantage of health care policy initiatives; 2) molecular and genetic  epidemiology and 3) patient outcomes, fostering more inter-programmatic research with clinicians."

"9525542","Project Abstract This project is a pilot clinical trial of a new brain stimulation treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder. OCD is a mental illness that affects 4-7 million people in the US. Of those, 50-70% still have substantial symptoms after being treated with medication or talk therapy. Recently, clinicians have started trying to treat OCD with deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS involves surgically placing electrodes into the brain, then sending electrical stimulation currents through those electrodes. Most investigators think that DBS for OCD works by affecting brain circuits called the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops, or CSTC loops. The belief is that OCD is caused by the CSTC loops being too strongly connected, so that signals get stuck in them and become the stuck, perseverative, obsessional thinking of OCD. To interrupt these loops, investigators have placed DBS into the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS), the S of CSTC. VC/VS DBS has helped several patient who had very treatment-resistant OCD. However, about half do not get better. We hypothesize that this is because DBS does not always influence cortico-striatal loops correctly, because it only affects a single area in this multi-area circuit. Our main objective (Aim 1) is to test a stimulator that affects the deep brain and the cortex (brain surface) at once and tries to break the abnormal CSTC synchrony. It drives two brain areas at slightly different frequencies, keeping them out of sync. Our second objective is to test whether activity in the CSTC loop correlates to the symptoms of OCD. No study has proven that these two are linked in humans, because it is difficult to record from the human brain, especially over long periods of time and from deep brain areas. We will use a novel technology, the Medtronic PC+S sensing DBS, to record the brain's activity while delivering the stimulation treatment (Aim 2a). As patients' symptoms improve, we expect to see that connectivity and synchrony between the surface and deep brain decreases along the same trajectory. We will also capture recordings during symptom flares and as patients participate in symptom-triggering activities such as exposure therapy sessions. This will help us further determine how well this brain activity correlates to symptoms. Finally, to help capture clearer signals, we will also collect those recordings while patients do a fear task that is linked to OCD severity, using EEG to further understand the cortico-striatal response to DBS (Aim 2b). This study leverages a broad interdisciplinary team of psychiatrists, statisticians, a neurosurgeon, and electrophysiologists, all with experience in OCD and brain stimulation."
"9406878","OVERVIEW SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite important advances in the treatment of learning disabilities (LDs), the dominant approach to intervention?direct skills instruction?fails to meet the needs of 25-40% of students with learning disabilities (LDs). Research is therefore required on innovative approaches that target the specific needs of subgroups of LD students (LD subtypes) to expand the framework for LD intervention. This LD Innovative Hub addresses an LD subtype that spans math problem solving (MPS) & reading comprehension (RC). This subset of the LD population (a) has been understudied, (b) experiences disproportionately poor response to intervention, and (c) has a distinctive set of needs. This Hub brings together a transdisciplinary team of researchers, spanning learning sciences, second language learning, LDs, and developmental psychology, to investigate a high-risk innovative approach to LD intervention tailored for this understudied and vulnerable population. The Hub?s approach involves embedding language comprehension instruction in direct skills intervention, with instructional scaffolding to explicitly connect MPS, RC, & language comprehension demands. The goal is to improve both outcomes with a unified approach to intervention. This scientific focus represents a unifying theme across the Hub?s Core and Project to achieve 4 aims: (1) advancing scientific understanding of LDs on a high-impact but understudied public health topic to identify directions that provide the field with novel solutions for improving outcomes; (2) relying on a transdisciplinary approach to build the intellectual infrastructure & a body of compelling, mature research findings to permit the transition of this Hub to an LD Research Center and other NIH program or funding opportunities; (3) cultivating a new generation of LD researchers; and (4) ensuring the relevance of this Hub?s scientific contributions and the future contributions of this Hub?s new generation of LD researchers for underrepresented groups."
"9604634","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Saliva performs a number of extremely important biological functions that are instrumental in maintaining oral health. It has been estimated that more than 5 million people in the US suffers from salivary gland dysfunction. Secretion of saliva is driven by concerted activities of a number of ion channels and transporters. Although, it is believed that calcium is the primary intracellular factor that regulates fluid secretion, the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of cytosolic calcium is not clearly understood. This is primarily due to the lack of information regarding the mechanism of regulation of calcium channels present in salivary glands. Furthermore, no information is available as how increase in cytosolic calcium modulates saliva secretion. Moreover, in Sjgren's syndrome patients, although the acinar tissues appear to be normal, they do not function properly and have a decreased calcium response to agonist-stimulation. This observation raises the possibility that calcium channels might be altered in this pathological condition. Results obtained from our awarded grant indicate that TRPC1 is the primary calcium channel in salivary glands and is intimately involved saliva secretion. To understand the regulation of TRPC1 channel we have shown that in human submandibular gland cells, TRPC1 interaction with STIM1, Cav1, and Orai1 dictates TRPC1 mediated calcium entry. Furthermore, these protein-protein interactions were confined to specific domains in the plasma membrane, however nothing is known if similar mechanisms are also present in vivo in salivary gland tissues. Therefore, in this renewal we intend to thoroughly characterize the role of cytosolic calcium in salivary gland function and to determine the relationship between transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC1) -1 and saliva secretion. The hypothesis of this study is that because calcium influx via TRPC1 plays a pivotal role in the physiological function of salivary glands, characterization of calcium channels in salivary glands will be important to understand the mechanism of saliva secretion, which could represent as drug targets in salivary gland dysfunction. We will coordinate our efforts in order to determine the functional significance of TRPC1 channel in regulating saliva secretion and how it leads to salivary gland destruction. We will also investigate the role of lipid rafts in the assembly/activation of the TRPC1 channel in mouse submandibular gland cells and will identify the mechanism involved in the regulation of TRPC1 via STIM1 and Orai1. The results of our studies are expected to provide new insights into the role of calcium channels and the molecular mechanism involved in saliva secretion. Greater understanding of these events responsible for saliva secretion will be important in elucidating new therapy for salivary gland dysfunctions."

"9528235","The goal of studies proposed in this application is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of the adaptor protein HSH2 in the B cell lineage and to structurally and functionally characterize low molecular weight (LMW) species of HSH2 expressed uniquely in germinal center B cells. Proper function of the humoral immune response is dependent on the process of class switch recombination, which involves recombination of variable gene elements on the immunoglobulin heavy chain with distal constant region gene elements to generate class switched antibodies that exhibit the same antigenic specificity, but have the ability to perform distinct effector functions required for mediating an optimal immune response against pathogens. Expression of the adaptor protein HSH2 is tightly regulated in B cell subpopulations in the periphery. High-level full length HSH2 expression is observed in innate like B cells (marginal zone and B1a/b B cells) that do not undergo class switching. Conversely, low-level full length HSH2 expression is observed in follicular and germinal center B cells that ultimately generate class-switched antibody secreting cells. Analysis of mouse models expressing high versus low levels of HSH2 have demonstrated that the expression of HSH2 inversely correlates with the production of class-switched antibody secreting cells and class-switched antibody in response to challenge with model antigens. The scientific premise of the proposed studies is that regulation of HSH2 expression plays a critical role in controlling the production of class-switched ASCs and Abs, and that delineation of the molecular mechanisms that regulate HSH2 expression are highly significant with respect to understanding how the humoral immune response is regulated. Two specific aims are proposed in this application. Because preliminary studies have shown that HSH2 expression is regulated via a post-translational mechanism mediating its turnover, experiments in Specific Aim 1 will be performed to analyze the B cell degradome, transcriptome and proteome to identify the protease responsible for rapid degradation of HSH2 in B cells. These studies have the potential to identify a novel post-translational regulatory process that plays a critical role in controlling the production of class-switched antibodies. Specific Aim 2 will focus on structural and functional characterization of LMW species of HSH2 that are uniquely expressed in germinal center B cells and that may play an important role in regulating the germinal center response leading to production of class-switched antibodies. Mass spectrometry will be used to characterize LMW species of HSH2, which will then be expressed via retroviral transduction of stem cells and adoptive transfer experiments to assess their function during the germinal center response following challenge with T-dependent antigen. The proposed studies are highly significant with respect to the development of strategies to manipulate the humoral response to enhance vaccine efficacy, as well as the humoral response against microbial pathogens. !"

Study patient recruitment within this RCC will be enhanced through utilization of real-time databases and diversity of site populations. Creation of new Network Assets is planned, using common data fields that will bridge individual Network trials to multiply the scientific yield of the Network. These Assets will inform current challenges in HF care, such as preventing hospitalizations, identifying new pathologic mutations in dilated cardiomyopathy, and characterizing patients with improved LVEF. The Harvard RCC will provide collaborative leadership for design and implementation of studies that address vital mechanistic and therapeutic questions that cannot be answered without NHLBI sponsorship. One example is a 3-arm comparative effectiveness study to determine Iron Repletion Effects on Exercise Capacity and Cardiac Function in Heart Failure (IRONOUT HF). This study will add to the understanding of the physiologic impact and explore treatments of iron deficiency in HF. The primary endpoint will be change in peak oxygen consumption after 24 weeks of intravenous iron, oral iron, or placebo. If benefit is shown, oral iron will be assessed for non-inferiority compared to the more expensive and inconvenient therapy with intravenous iron. This study will also assess skeletal muscle oxygen utilization during low level exercise, and relate changes in hemoglobin, iron stores, the iron-regulatory protein hepcidin, and novel iron-dependent metabolomic profiles to changes in exercise capacity in order to identify patients most likely to benefit from iron repletion. The Clinical Research Skills Development Core supports a rigorous course curriculum, hands-on-laboratory experience, and a Mentor Review Board to train and inspire new HF clinical investigators. Utilizing the Network Assets, an Apprentice Investigator Network is planned where fellows throughout the HF Network will collaborate to become the next generation of clinical investigators."

The candidate's career goal is to become an independent investigator in the field of cardiovascular imaging. The K25 Quantitative Career Development Award is of critical importance for transitioning to independence. The award will provide additional training, mentoring and protected time for research to develop a clear understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and clinical aspects of atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, enhance Dr. Brunner's grantsmanship skills, and to gain advanced experience in performing clinical imaging studies. The K25 award will provide Dr. Brunner with the necessary experience to develop a strong independent program in cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Brunner's preliminary studies, recent publications, and new data since the first submission and multidisciplinary training form the basis of this application and present a logical continuation of his previous research and training. The Texas Medical Center is a superb environment that provides the necessary facilities and educational resources for Dr. Brunner to pursue a targeted mentoring phase in order to develop into an independent investigator. Mentoring Team and Career Development: Dr. Brunner and his primary mentor Christie Ballantyne MD, an internationally recognized leader in atherosclerosis, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and lipoprotein research, have assembled an outstanding mentoring team including Lawrence Lavery, DPM, MPH, an international expert in wound healing and diabetic ulcers; Dipan Shah, MD a national expert in clinical cardiovascular imaging; Ashok Balasubramanyam, MD an international expert in diabetes and cardiovascular disease; Raja Muthupillai, PhD a national leader in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI physics; Vijay Nambi, MD/PhD a national expert in cardiology, atherosclerosis and ultrasonography; and Joel Morrisett, PhD an internationally known leader in vascular imaging and atherosclerosis. Dr. Brunner's mentors have tremendous experience in research and mentoring junior investigators, as evident by NIH funded projects including an institutional T32 training grant for +15 years. His mentoring team and Dr. Brunner have agreed on metrics for every year of his career development. Based on past productivity, Dr. Brunner will publish 5 manuscripts in the first 2 years, 3-5 articles annually in years 3 and 4, and 4-8 in the last year. Dr. Brunner will be the fist author on at least 50% of his published work. Dr. Brunner's immediate career goal is to obtain a funded career development award. His 3-year goal is to complete education and training. His 4-year goal is to write an RO1 NIH grant to secure continuous funding. His 6-7 year goal is to be promoted to Associate Professor with tenure and his 10-year goal is to be a national leader in cardiovascular imaging and to mentor junior scientists. Research Plan: Diabetes mellitus is a multi-facetted disease associated with macrovascular (large vessel disease) complications such as PAD and microvascular complications (small vessel disease). Up to 40% of ischemic diabetic ulcers do not heal after 1-year following either open bypass surgery or endovascular revascularization. This presents a conundrum, i.e., lower extremity ischemia persists in what otherwise appears to be a patent vessel. Several studies suggest that alterations in the microcirculation may contribute to the poor wound healing of ischemic diabetic ulcers. However, the association of microcirculation with wound healing in diabetics with ischemia remains unknown. Identifying patients who are unlikely to achieve wound healing at the outset, would likely benefit patients and the health care system. This field is severely hampered by the lack of clinical measures to quantify microvascular circulation. Therefore, this proposal will elucidate th role that skeletal foot muscle microcirculation plays in diabetics with ischemic ulcers. Dr. Brunner has previously demonstrated the feasibility of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol to assess muscle perfusion (microvascular circulation) in healthy controls and PAD patients. The applicant's latest data show that skeletal muscle perfusion, as measured with contrast-enhanced (CE)-MRI is markedly reduced in PAD patients (including diabetics) compared to healthy controls, confirming results by other groups. His data also reveal that muscle perfusion shows heterogeneous patterns across muscle compartments indicating perfusion abnormalities, and CE-MRI skeletal muscle perfusion characteristics correlate inversely with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a known marker of microvascular disease. This proposal will test the hypothesis that microvascular circulation (skeletal muscle perfusion), as measured with CE-MRI in the foot, is impaired in diabetics with ischemic ulcers compared to comorbidity matched controls and that baseline microvascular circulation is more impaired in diabetics with non-healing ulcers at 1 year after clinically indicated lower-extremity revascularization. The proposed non-invasive MRI studies will, for the first time, provide quantitative data on the skeletal foot muscle microcirculation in diabetics with ischemic ulcers. These studies will advance our understanding of the role that microvascular circulation plays in diabetics with ischemia before and after clinically indicated arterial revascularization."
"9395960","Project Summary:  The limbs of tetrapod vertebrates are composed of four basic segments: the limb, forelimb, wrist/ankle, and hand/foot. The identity of these segments is determined during limb formation by specific combinations of Hox genes. As the limb bud grows away from the main body axis, two waves of Hoxd gene expression occur. The first wave specifies the limb and forelimb. Then, following a short period of low Hoxd expression, a second wave of expression specifies the hand and foot portions. Cells that are produced during the transient step between these waves will form the wrist and ankle. Remarkably, these two phases of expression result from topological changes within the HoxD gene cluster and flanking regulatory domains. During formation of the arm and forearm, enhancers in the telomeric regulatory domain (T-DOM) drive the first collinear wave of expression. Then in proliferating distal limb bud cells, the T-DOM is inactivated, followed shortly by activation of the centromeric regulatory domain enhancers (C-DOM), driving the second wave of Hoxd expression and formation of the hand. The HoxA transcription factor HOXA13 is essential to this transition, acting to repress T-DOM and then activating C-DOM. The goal of the work proposed here is to understand how changes in enhancer status drive the topological transition between the two waves of Hoxd expression. To do this, we will perform two key experiments to challenge the conversion of each regulatory domain from active to inactive, or vice-versa. Specifically, we will first disrupt the activation of C-DOM by deleting an important autopod (hand/foot) enhancer called II-1. Our preliminary data indicates that HOXA13 acts through II-1 to drive the second wave of Hoxd expression. We will then target a copy of this enhancer into T-DOM, providing HOXA13 with an enhancer element that it normally acts through to activate C-DOM, but now within the chromatin context of T-DOM, which is being silenced in the same cells. We will evaluate changes in the chromatin state induced by these genetic perturbations by monitoring chromatin modifications via histone ChIP-Seq (H3K27me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27Ac) and ATAC-Seq. We will monitor for changes in gene expression quantity by RNA-Seq, and changes in the location of expression by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Furthermore, because we expect these mutations to induce large-scale changes in chromatin topology and possibly force continued activity from native T-DOM enhancers, we will utilize Capture Hi-C to monitor changes in HoxD topology. One prediction from these experiments is that each modified regulatory domain will resist complete conversion from one state to the other, due to the influence of this enhancer, with significant changes in chromosomal topology and gene expression. This experimental approach mirrors some natural mutations in chromatin structure that influence human development and health. Together these experiments will shed light on the molecular mechanisms of limb patterning, developmental gene regulation, and the influence of enhancers on genome topology."
"9402632","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emphysema is a leading cause of disability and death in the United States and worldwide. Millions of people suffer from this disease, which often goes undiagnosed for many years and irreversibly destroys lung parenchyma. It is unclear how the disease progresses, but there are emerging investigations indicating that the development and extent of emphysema may follow certain pathogenic pathways. In recent years, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction therapy has been gaining significant attention as a treatment for emphysema to reduce hyperinflation, improve lung function, and relieve symptoms (e.g., short of breath) because of its minimally invasive characteristic. However, it is difficult to determine which patients could actually benefit from this bronchoscopic therapy. The primary challenge is the lack of an accurate, quantitative, and non-invasive way to assess an individual's inter-lobar collateral ventilation (CV). Preliminarily studies by some investigators and us revealed that pulmonary fissure integrity (completeness) depicted on CT images may play a crucial role in interlobar CV, but the exact contribution to the interlobar CV remains unclear. We propose to advance our previous work to comprehensively investigate pulmonary fissure morphology, emphysema distribution patterns, and their 3D spatial integration. Our ultimate goal is to develop a risk stratification model for assessing function decline, COPD progression, and responses to endobronchial valve (EBV) therapy. Our assumption is that the interlobar CV is affected by multiple factors, such as the existence of incomplete fissures surrounded by emphysema, and not simply fissure integrity. Therefore the current approaches to assess interlobar CV by fissure integrity on CT images may be insufficient. If successful, the developed computer tool may not only aid in assessing COPD progression and possible developing optimal patient management practices, but also significantly simplify pre-operative work-up in identifying patients for EBV therapy. We have the following specific aims: (1) continue to populate our chest CT examination database, (2) further develop our 3D fissure and lung models to integrates fissure morphology and emphysema severity and distribution, (3) evaluate the functional implications of features morphology, emphysema distribution patterns, and integrative lung model, and (4) develop and validate a risk stratification model for function decline, COPD progression, and responses to EBV therapy."

"9433686","Project Summary  The hippocampus plays a critical role in the formation of episodic memories. The current predominant hypothesis is that memories are gradually established across distributed cortical networks under the in?uence of hippocampal activity. However, our understanding of the nature and extent of hippocampal in?uences on cortical circuits remains incomplete. Part of the challenge has been that any subthreshold modulation of cortical neurons is inaccessible to extracellular recordings, which have been the main tool for studying of cortico-hippocampal interactions. We propose to combine whole-cell recordings in auditory cortex (AC) with optogenetic control of the projections to this area from the hippocampal complex (HC), in order to quantify the in?uence of the HC-AC projections on the membrane potential dynamics of individual cortical neurons as a function of brain state and learning. We aim to use this approach to identify cortical neurons that receive direct hippocampal input, and characterize their properties and the plasticity of the corresponding synapses in vivo. Finally, we aim to use optogenetic perturbations of the HC-AC projections during learning events and hippocampal ripples to establish the functional role of these projections in memory formation, and to study the timing of their participation in the consolidation process. Quantifying the subthreshold modulation of cortical neurons by hippocampal inputs can provide sensitive measures of the functional coupling between these areas and bring us closer to a mechanistic understanding of their interactions and their role in memory formation."
"9405900","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am a junior investigator in pediatric sleep medicine with advanced training in translational research. My research is focused on the pathophysiology and complications of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and their influence on nervous system function, including sensation, cognition and behavior. OSAS is common, affecting 2-3% of children. It is associated with significant morbidity such as growth failure, systemic, and pulmonary hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, cognitive and behavioral deficits. The latter is of paramount importance as the brain undergoes crucial development during childhood and thus, the long-term consequences of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction may have great impact on children's future adult life. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that children with OSAS have abnormal cerebral flood flow (CBF) regulation during wakefulness and sleep. We further hypothesize that this impairment correlates with the degree of behavioral and cognitive dysfunction, and improves after treatment of OSAS. This proposal comprises a mechanistic research study that will evaluate CBF, cerebral oxygen saturation, and cerebral blood volume measured by diffuse optical spectroscopy/diffuses correlation spectroscopy during wakefulness and sleep in children with OSAS compared with controls, and correlate these findings with a comprehensive neurobehavioral testing battery. Children with OSAS will be retested 6 and 12 months after adenotonsillectomy evaluate CBF, cognitive and behavioral changes after treatment. Controls will be reevaluated 6 and 12 months after baseline to assess CBF, cognitive and behavioral changes over time in the healthy children. This is a most significant area of research as early brain insults result in increased risk of morbidity compared with similar later insults. My comprehensive career development plan includes didactic training in advanced Biostatistics, Optical Physics and Spectroscopy, Measurement and Assessment, and Clinical Trial Design; and mentorship by leaders in pediatric sleep medicine, neurology, psychology, and physics. This plan will draw on outstanding resources, such as the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute, Clinical Translational Research Award, Sleep Center, and Neurovascular Imaging Laboratory; in addition to the Diffuse Optical Imaging and Spectroscopy Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania. My short term goals are to: (1) dedicate 75% effort to this research and training program and (2) to submit an R01 proposal based on these findings by year 4 of this award. My overarching long-term goal is to become an independent and established academic pediatric physician-scientist with an established NIH-funded clinical translational research program to investigate the pathophysiology of pediatric OSAS, the brain consequences of untreated OSAS, and the impact of treatment on the developing brain. Additional goals are to (1) mentor the next generation of clinical investigators and training-grant recipient with an emphasis on minority researchers and (2) participate in Hispanic advocacy groups to raise awareness of OSAS in underserved populations.

"9446383","PROJECT SUMMARY:  Our proposed comprehensive model of DNA radiation-induced damage describes physicochemical events from the initial track structure and DNA ion-radical-excited state formation through hole and electron transfer, to chemical events involving free radical processes that lead to secondary radicals and, finally, to combination and redox processes that result in DNA damage such as base and sugar damage, strand scission and associated base release. The overall goal of the current proposed effort is to test several aspects this overall model, to modify it as appropriate, and thereby elucidate fundamental mechanisms of radiation damage to DNA by radiations of varying linear energy transfer (LET). These studies will be performed under conditions that emphasize the direct effect of radiation, and will employ magnetic resonance spectroscopies (ESR, NMR), product analyses (HPLC, LC- MS/MS), gamma and cyclotron heavy ion-beam irradiation, as well as theoretical modeling including time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The first aim will determine the protonation state of the hole (guanine cation radical (G?+)) in a G-quadruplex. Subsequently, it will test the feasibility of hole transfer process from a single guanine base to a guanine in G-quadruplexes within a DNA-oligomer as well as the hole transfer process from a G-quadruplex to DNA base analogs of varying redox potential such as the easily oxidized pseudoisoguanine (PIG). It will also whether G-quadruplex is an ultimate local sink of radiation-produced electrons. These studies will test the hypotheses that the G-quadruplex, owing to its low redox potential, will protect against radiation-induced hole and electron transfer processes as well as excitation events and are of significance to radiation damage to telomeres. The second aim involves the role of ion-beams in DNA damage in nucleohistone and in DNA and will test the hypothesis that the yield of sugar radicals from LEE and excited state processes increase as LET increases along the beam path. C3??dephos will be used as a marker for LEE-induced processes along the beam path. The ratio of purine to pyrimidine base release will be used as a marker for excitation- induced strand breaks. We will test the hypotheses that at the Bragg peak, where fewer radicals are stabilized in nucleohistone or in DNA owing to the ion-radical recombination events, changes will occur in the individual DNA damage product yields and their nature from that found in the ion-beam LET plateau region. The third aim will employ theoretical calculations to further test and confirm molecular mechanisms proposed in each of the above-mentioned aims. In addition, several hypotheses will be tested. The most important is that redox properties calculated with DFT can predict the fate of DNA- radical intermediates. This aim directly aids Aim 1. These efforts will allow us to establish new insights into the fundamental radiation-induced physicochemical processes which are important for biomedical research."
"9612356","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Enabled Memory Training for Schizophrenia     Advances in science supporting the growth and adaptability, or neuroplasticity, of human brain cells into late adulthood provide new promise for interventions designed to preserve and re habilitate brain function. The merging of brain science and computer technology has created a consumer market for software designed to train brain functions, such as memory and attention, following the rationale that brain circuitry can be strengthened like muscles in response to repetitive exercise. So called computer-based cognitive training software can be purchased privately at low cost, can be used on mobile devices, is designed to be enjoyable and motivating, and can be self-administered without clinical oversight. However, while accessibility and portability are advantages of computer-based interventions, there i s also an important and often overlooked shortcoming: it cannot be assumed that compromised brain areas, or normally expected approaches to performing cognitive training exercises, will be utilized during this training. Instead, compensatory mechanisms that have developed naturally around weakened or damaged brain tissue may be used preferentially. Therefore, as compensatory mechanisms are learned and reinforced during training, underutilization of the damaged tissue may lead to further weakening, rather than strengthening, of its natural function. The proposed research will attempt to address a critical limitation of current cognitive training software through the development of a brain-computer interface (BCI) enabled training program. Use of BCI technology in rehabilitation has primarily focused on spinal cord injury and motor neuron disease, where BCI enables the user to control external devices by brain activity transmitted via electroencephalogram (EEG). In a novel application of BCI, this project will examine how interactive control over training software functions could be used to monitor and reinforce targeted brain activity during training. This project will extend ongoing research on computer-based cognitive training in schizophrenia, which has produced a large pool of EEG recordings of patients and healthy community members performing a memory task. Analysis of archived data using advanced classification approaches will provide patterns of EEG activity associated with correct and failed memory trials, and differences in EEG that best distinguish patients from healthy comparison subjects. Next, a prototype training program will be built based on the same memory task but enhanced by a gaming environment and BCI control. Conventional EEG-based BCI software will be used for online signal processing, classification of EEG features, and communication with the training prototype. The memory training prototype will feature BCI control over trial start, difficulty level, and user response according to parameters for optimal brain activity identified in the archived data. Finally, usability and efficacy of the memory trainng prototype will be evaluated in a pilot stud y of schizophrenia and healthy volunteers under two training conditions: 1) using BCI parameters selected for optimal performance and, 2) using BCI parameters selected for suboptimal performance. The suboptimal condition will serve as a control for the active training condition, using the same BCI-enabled features but set to respond to EEG activity associated with failed memory trial performance. Primary outcomes will be based on comparison of EEG recordings and memory performance under the two training conditions, determining that targeted brain activity can be enlisted under BCI control, and that performance is enhanced when brain activity is in an optimal state. Usability and acceptability of the training prototype will be assessed by questionnaire."
"9426062","Project Summary  A large body of empirical work has focused on risky behavior and mental disorders during adolescence, but our knowledge of the neurobehavioral developments in prosocial behavior is quite limited. The result is a portrait of adolescent brain development that focuses risk and psychopathology over more positive behavior. This focus is unfortunate because several prosocial behaviors that involve giving to others ? ranging from volunteering to providing instrumental or social assistance ? have been linked to healthy psychological, behavioral, and physical profiles. Giving resources and assistance to others is associated with lower mortality, fewer objective and subjective health problems, and lower depression. The health benefits of giving to others warrant an increased focus on the neurobehavioral developments that underlie this core aspect of prosocial behavior during adolescence, a key point of development that sets the stage for lifelong health and well-being.  We aim to advance the field by utilizing a longitudinal design to pursue four specific aims: (1) clarify developmental changes in prosocial behavior during adolescence by longitudinally examining a specific, fundamental prosocial behavior (i.e., giving) and how it increasingly depends upon the situation (i.e., the potential recipient, the cost of giving); (2) examine how neurodevelopment in the reward, mentalizing, and cognitive control neural networks tracks with giving behavior; (3) assess how social relationships, perspective- taking, empathy, and values may relate to giving and neural development; (4) explore potential gender differences in average levels of giving and neural processes.  Using a cohort-sequential longitudinal design, a total of 180 participants will be assessed at three times, every two-years, across a five-year period. The total sample will consist of three overlapping age cohorts of 60 participants each and will cover the age span from 9 to 17 yrs. (Cohort 1: 9-13 yrs., Cohort 2: 11-15 yrs., Cohort 3: 13-17 yrs.). At each time point, participants will participate in an established decision-making task optimized for the fMRI scanner in which they will be asked to make real financial contributions to their families, friends, and a stranger under varying conditions of cost to themselves. While making decisions, participants' brains will be scanned for activation and functional connectivity between regions and networks that have been implicated in mentalizing, cognitive control, and reward-related behaviors. Adolescents also will complete questionnaires and daily diary checklists that will assess aspects of social relationships, perspective-taking, empathy, and values thought to predict prosocial behavior."
"9471728","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have been associated with increased prevalence of both traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among veterans. Recent data demonstrate that those with TBI-related injuries concurrent with PTSD, experience worsening of symptoms in the delayed post- deployment period. The compounded effects of PTSD-TBI make the diagnosis, management, treatment, and rehabilitation of those affected a challenge in VA, military, and civilian medical facilities. It has become increasingly important to recognize symptoms in veterans with comorbid PTSD-TBI compared to those symptoms associated with TBI or PTSD alone, in the rehabilitation period. One mechanism to have recently come into focus to explain the compounded effects of comorbid PTSD-TBI is impaired cortical activation, a condition that has been observed following either TBI or PTSD alone. TBI itself results in hypoactivity of cortical neurons, which is mirrored in patients affected with onl PTSD. Surprisingly, to date, there have been few preclinical studies to evaluate the impact of combined TBI and PTSD on neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex, adding to the significance and conceptual innovation of the proposed project. This knowledge gap will be addressed in the current application by examining cortical hypoactivation in comorbid PTSD-TBI, using mouse models of mild, non-contusive TBI and PTSD. Cortical hypoactivation will be evaluated at numerous levels, including markers of excitatory neurotransmission, dendritic structure, cortical volume, neuronal activation and cortically-mediated behaviors. The strength of this application is the comprehensive analysis of cortical function from receptor expression and activation to behavioral measures and use of novel imaging modalities to examine the longitudinal progression of symptoms. In addition, rehabilitative interventions using novel glutamatergic compounds, such as memantine, will be employed as translationally-relevant therapies for comorbid PTSD-TBI. We hypothesize that the combination of PTSD-TBI will exacerbate behavioral and molecular endpoints, functional/structural assessments of excitatory neurotransmitter levels, dendritic morphology, cortical volume, neuronal plasticity and cortical activation compared to either condition alone and that these deficits will be reversed by neurotherapeutic intervention. We will test this hypothesis using the following Specific Aims: 1.) Evaluate the influence of comorbid PTSD- TBI on cognitive behaviors, neuronal structure and markers of excitatory neurotransmission compared to either condition alone, 2.) Quantify the long-term impacts of comorbid PTSD-TBI on cortical neurotransmitter levels (neurochemical), volume (structural) and neuroactivation (functional) using novel magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques in a longitudinal manner in vivo compared to either condition alone, 3.) Evaluate the ability of neurotherapeutic treatment to improve/restore structural and neurotransmitter-related deficits associated with PTSD-TBI and thereby, to improve cognitive behaviors and cortical function."
"9407222","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) exert a huge public burden that will accelerate with the growing rates of obesity. These conditions share a pro- inflammatory state, yet shared underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The community of commensal microbes that reside in the gut has emerged as a modulator of inflammation, immune function and metabolism. Genetic knockout of innate immune components can recapitulate many aspects of MetS that are mediated by altered microbiota. Studies in human disease cohorts show the feasibility of finding microbial profiles associated with CVD, T2D and MetS, and implicate specific pathways of microbial metabolism (e.g., biosynthesis of short-chain fatty acids [SCFA] and trimethylamine-N-oxide [TMAO]) that interact with diet and may modulate inflammation, metabolism, and risk of CVD, MetS and T2D. However, our understanding of how these pathways interact with microbial taxonomy and function, host pathways and environment (e.g., diet) remains incomplete. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the function of the gut microbiota may provide a unifying mechanism for many of the overlapping metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes observed in CVD, MetS and T2D. Specifically, we will test focused hypotheses about the roles of the SCFA and TMAO pathways, including their relation to microbial species and function, diet, host genotype, and CVD, MetS and T2D. We will also pursue secondary, unbiased analyses into the association of microbiota composition and function with CVD, MetS and T2D. We will test these hypotheses in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Gen3 and Omni2 cohorts, a middle-aged, multi-ethnic, community-based sample of 3800 men and women. In Aim 1, we will use 16S rRNA gene sequence and calculated microbial pathway/functional information to test hypotheses about the relation of stool SCFA and plasma TMAO levels to gut microbial species and function, diet, and prevalent CVD, MetS and T2D. In Aim 2, we will identify host genes that influence: (a) stool SCFA and plasma TMAO levels, (b) microbial taxa/functions associated with stool SCFA or plasma TMAO, and (c) taxa/functions associated with prevalent CVD, MetS or T2D (while identifying host features shared vs. private to more than one of these diseases). In Aim 3, we will test whether meta-genomic, metatranscriptomic and metabolomics microbiota profiles of stool samples at baseline and in close proximity to incident CVD or MetS confer additional mechanistic insights. Understanding how specific microbial pathways relate to diet, host genes, and disease risk may ultimately lead to novel therapies that modulate microbial function or host- microbe functional interactions. This application combines FHS genotypes, phenotypes and expertise in CVD and metabolic disease with a team experienced in the Human Microbiome Project and drawing biomedical insights from microbiome studies. The data from this study will be a community resource and benefit microbiota studies in the broader community."
"9506493","Invasive aspergillosis (IA), caused predominantly by Aspergillus fumigatus, is the most common cause of fungal associated mortality in patients with chronic and severe immunosuppression caused by hematological cancers, transplantation, prolonged corticosteroid therapy, and genetic immunodeficiencies. IA mortality rates of 50% are common in heavily immunosuppressed leukemia patients and transplant recipients. No new classes of antifungals have been commercialized since 2001. The ineffectiveness of existing antifungal drugs warrants new therapeutic strategies. Cancer cells frequently express checkpoint proteins, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, to evade attack by the immune system. Antibodies that target these proteins have shown much promise in treating certain cancers. Importantly, checkpoint blockade approaches to treating life-threatening IA infections that are unresponsive to conventional therapy have not yet been evaluated. We hypothesize that anti?PD-1 and/or anti? CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade, either alone or in combination with conventional antifungal agents, will be beneficial in an immunosuppressed murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade as a treatment for IPA. Our working hypothesis for this aim is that checkpoint blockade will be beneficial in IPA. 5  106 A. fumigatus conidia will be delivered to the lungs via intranasal administration in 8-week-old female BALB/c mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and cortisone acetate as per our previous studies. Starting 6 h after infection, mice will be given a daily intraperitoneal injection for 8 days, of either saline, anti?CTLA-4(100 ?g), anti?PD-1(250 ?g), or a combination of both checkpoint inhibitors (CPI?s). Intraperitoneal injection with Isotype IgG antibodies will serve as controls. The experiments will be terminated on day 9. We will assess the effects of CPI?s by measuring mouse survival, pulmonary fungal burden as assessed by both histology and quantitative PCR, and pulmonary and serum mRNA and protein levels, of Th1-signature cytokines (IFN-?, IL-6, and TNF-?, that are important in host responses in IPA) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10, that are associated with negative outcomes in IPA). Specific Aim 2: Determine the efficacy of checkpoint blockade along with antifungal therapy to treat IPA. Our working hypothesis for this aim is that CPI when administered in combination with antiifungals, will be more effective than CPI regimen alone. We will use the CPI regimen that elicits the best response in Aim 1 along with 1 of 2 antifungal drugs that have anti-Aspergillus activity, caspofungin (an echinocandin with immune enhancing properties) and posaconazole (a triazole with immunological neutral effects). We hypothesize that the combination of CPI and caspofungin would result in a more effective immune mediated clearance compared to CPI alone or compared to CPI plus posaconazole. This innovative preclinical study will determine if checkpoint blockade can serve as a novel strategy to treat life threatening opportunistic fungal infections."
"9613293","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) cause the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans, with ~400 million infections annually. The mechanisms by which the host immune response to DENV provides either protection or enhancement in a subsequent infection with a different DENV serotype are poorly understood, and this has been a major hindrance in vaccine development. The suboptimal results from the first proof-of-concept dengue vaccine efficacy trial highlight the critical need t better understand the immune response to natural DENV infections and vaccine candidates and to identify robust correlates of protection. This P01 Program applies state-of-the-art immunological methods in the context of long-term ongoing clinical and epidemiological studies of natural DENV infections in Nicaragua as well as Phase 2 and 3 vaccine trials of the Takeda tetravalent live-attenuated dengue vaccine (TV-LAV). We propose to study qualitative and quantitative features of B and T cell immune responses in humans under a coordinated P01 Program including three projects: 1) B cell and antibody responses to natural dengue virus infections; 2) B cell and antibody responses following live attenuated dengue virus vaccination; 3) T cell responses following DENV natural infections and live-attenuated dengue virus vaccination. The overall hypothesis is that DENV-nave and DENV-exposed individuals develop fundamentally different protective B and T cell responses upon exposure to a new DENV infection or live vaccine. Moreover, we posit that it is the quality as well as the quantity of neutralizing antibodies that determines protective efficacy. The P01 is highly synergistic in that samples from the same individuals and/or sample sets, as well as specific assays and methodologies, are being shared among the Projects, which are supported by an Administrative Core, Immunology Core, and Clinical & Data Management Core. The P01 also leverages a number of existing grants and contracts supporting dengue studies, vaccine trials, and epitope mapping programs. We have formed a Consortium of world-renowned investigators with extensive experience and on-going programs in dengue clinical, immunological, and virological research and vaccine development - thus ensuring a high-quality successful research program, especially since the investigators have a long history of productive collaboration (>190 joint publications). The P01 should result in: 1) Improved understanding of what constitutes protective adaptive immunity in 1 and 2 DENV infections and in nave and previously DENV-exposed recipients of a dengue TVLAV, which can inform future vaccine formulations; 2) Identification of natural and vaccine-induced B cell/antibody and CD4+/CD8+ T cell correlates of protection that can be used to assess existing and future vaccines; 3) Identification of potential therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and T cell peptide vaccines; and 4) Mapping of novel epitopes and generation of recombinant viruses that can serve as new epitope-specific diagnostic tools."
"9427108","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We and others have shown that the nonapeptide, oxytocin (OT), circumvents leptin resistance and elicits body weight (BW) loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents, nonhuman primates and obese humans, by reducing both food intake and increasing energy expenditure (EE). The discovery of recruitable brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has renewed interest in targeting BAT to elicit weight loss by increasing EE. OT neurons that project directly from the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN) to the hindbrain nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) are positioned to regulate energy homeostasis by reducing food intake and increasing BAT thermogenesis. In Specific Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that OT-induced stimulation of sympathetic outflow to interscapular (IBAT) contributes to its ability to elicit weight loss in DIO rodents. To test this, we will determine whether disrupting sympathetic activation of IBAT blocks the ability of fourth ventricular (4V) OT administration to increase EE and elicit weight loss in male and female DIO rats. We will also determine if sympathetic outflow to both IBAT and white adipose tissue mediate the effects of OT on EE by testing the extent to which pharmacological blockade of beta-3 adrenergic receptors impairs the ability of 4V OT administration to increase EE in male and female DIO rats. Endpoints will include EE, IBAT temperature (TIBAT), norepinephrine turnover (NETO), food intake, and BW. We anticipate these studies to establish a key role for sympathetic outflow to IBAT in the mechanism by which OT increases EE and elicits BW loss. In Specific Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that increased OT receptor (OTR) signaling within the NTS elicits prolonged weight loss through distinct mechanisms that simultaneously reduce food intake and activate IBAT to increase EE. To accomplish this we will reduce NTS OTR signaling by using both viral and pharmacological approaches. This strategy will enable us to identify the extent to which these OTRs are required for effects of both exogenous 4V OT administration and activation of endogenous OT signaling via chemogenetic excitation of pPVN OT neurons, the sole source of endogenous OT relevant to sympathetic outflow. If we find that disrupting NTS OTR signaling attenuates the ability of both exogenous and endogenous OT to reduce food intake as well as increase EE, these studies will establish a key role for an OT-containing neurocircuit projecting from pPVN to NTS in the control of energy balance. We also hypothesize that deficient NTS OTR signaling mimics the metabolic and behavioral impairments associated with DIO and leptin resistance, and abrogates the anti-obesity effect of chronic systemic OT treatment. To test this, we will administer a Cre- expressing AAV into the NTS of Oxtrflox mice to ablate OTRs from NTS neurons and measure responsiveness to systemic leptin or chronic systemic OT. Together, our findings will delineate whether NTS OTRs mediate the anti-obesity effects of OT through a mechanism that requires increased SNS outflow to IBAT and direct future studies to address whether intranasal OT may reverse human obesity by stimulating BAT thermogenesis."
"9415987","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bone loss is among the most disabling and costly conditions suffered by Americans, and can be caused by traumatic injury, inflammatory and infectious diseases, congenital defects or oncologic resection. Conventional treatment involves harvesting bone grafts from the patient or another tissue donor for repair of the defect. These approaches face limitations such as donor site morbidity, insufficient or poor quality donor tissue, and potential immunogenicity. Stem cell-based therapy offers a promising alternative approach for the repair of bone loss such as cranial and long bone defects, however, treating large bony defects remains one major challenge. A critical barrier to progress in the field is the lack of suitable cell carriers that can support stem cell survival, and guide vascularized and mineralized bone formation in situ. To address the above challenges, our proposed multidisciplinary approach aims to validate the efficacy of microribbon-based scaffolds as a novel type of cell carrier for enhancing stem cell survival and mineralized bone matrix deposition in vivo. The proposed work will be accomplished by an interdisciplinary research team comprised of basic and clinician scientists, with complementary expertise in biomaterials, stem cells, molecular imaging and animal models to validate the efficacy of novel tissue engineering strategies for bone repair. We have demonstrated the unique microribbon morphology confers markedly enhanced mechanical strength of the scaffolds, with interconnected macroporosity to support cell proliferation and extracellular matrix formation. We hypothesize that: (1) osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in microribbon-based scaffolds can be enhanced by tuning the stiffness and biochemical cues of microribbons; and (2) the macroporosity of microribbon-based scaffolds would lead to enhanced cell survival, faster vascularization and enhanced bone tissue formation in vivo. To test these hypotheses, three specific aims will be pursued including (1) Develop and characterize poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based microribbons for forming 3D macroporous cell niche with independently tunable biochemical and mechanical cues; (2) Determine the optimal biochemical ligands and stiffness of PEG-based microribbons that support osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stromal cells in vitro; and (3) Assess the efficacy of microribbon-based scaffolds for repairing bony defects in vivo using a murine cranial defect model. We expect the findings from this proposal would improve the current treatment options for bone loss, a debilitating condition that afflicts individuals across all populations and ages, and correspondingly reduce the associated socio-economical burden on society."
"9508757","Abstract Increasing evidence indicates that proper host-microbe interactions in the gastrointestinal tract are crucial for human overall health and well-being. Dysregulated host responses to gut microbiota are major contributors to allergic, immunologic, and infectious diseases, resulting in very high economic and quality of life burdens. Yet, prevention or early diagnosis and treatment of these diseases remain a challenge due to our limited knowledge of the mechanisms underlying host-microbe homeostasis. Our long-term goal is to gain a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which host-microbe homeostasis is precisely controlled to improve the diagnosis and the treatment of human diseases caused by dysregulated host-microbe interactions. The objective of this application is to determine roles of hnRNPI (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein I), which we recently identified as a novel regulator of neonatal immune tolerance, in downregulating TLR signaling and inducing intestinal immune tolerance. Development of intestinal immune tolerance is a fundamentally important step in establishing host-microbe homeostasis, and is associated with transient suppression of TLR signaling. Transient suppression of TLR signaling activity has been reported to be critical for microbe colonization in the neonatal intestine and development of endotoxin tolerance in adulthood. The precise mechanisms underlying TLR signaling suppression remain unclear, but have been shown to correlate with proteolytic degradation of IRAK1, a key component of TLR signaling. Using a mouse model in which hnRNPI is ablated in intestinal epithelial cells, we demonstrate that hnRNPI downregulates protein level of IRAK1 and suppresses activity of TLR ?mediated NF-?B signaling in the neonatal colon. To better understand hnRNPI-mediated TLR signaling suppression, here we propose to investigate whether hnRNPI controls neonatal intestinal immune tolerance through downregulating MyD88-mediated TLR signaling. Moreover, we propose to investigate the role of hnRNPI in the development of endotoxin tolerance in adulthood. Completion of the proposed studies will build a solid foundation for our future in-depth mechanistic studies on hnRNPI- dependent TLR signaling regulation, which will likely uncover novel mechanisms important for the control of intestinal innate immunity."
"9468328","Abstract  Results in our publication demonstrate for the first time that Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), a commensal bacterium of the human skin, functions as a probiotic bacterium that employs carbohydrate fermentation to restrain the over-growth of Propionibacterium acnes, a skin opportunistic bacterium associated with acne vulgaris. To intensify the ability of S. epidermidis to beat out its competitor (P. acnes), the ?-lactose monohydrate (ALM), a selective fermentation initiator, has been used to exclusively trigger the fermentation of S. epidermidis. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by ALM fermentation of S. epidermidis effectively suppress the growth of P. acnes in vitro and in mice. We thus hypothesize that SCFAs within acne lesions are key components to rein in the overgrown P. acnes. The deficiency of SCFAs in human skin may promote the progression of acne vulgaris.  SCFAs will act as adjuvants in the post-antibiotic adjuvant therapy for treatment of acne vulgaris. The post-antibiotic adjuvant therapy will reduce the required dose and side-effects of antibiotics. We have recently obtained acne biopsies in collaboration with Dr. Tissa R. Hata, a Director of the Dermatology Clinical Trials Unit at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). These acne biopsies have been used to establish ex vivo acne explants. The effectiveness of SCFA or the SCFA/antibiotic combination on suppression of P. acnes growth and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines will be evaluated by using ex vivo acne explants. Furthermore, we will explore the action mechanism of SCFAs on reduction of inflammatory acne vulgaris via inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC).  Three Specific Aims are proposed to validate our hypothesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will obtain the P. acnes-selective SCFAs, and examine the role of the inhibition of HDAC by SCFAs in the reduction of P. acnes-induced inflammation. In Specific Aim 2, we will explore the essential roles of SCFAs in the inhibition of P. acnes growth using SCFA-deficient/germ-free mice, and quantify the concentrations of SCFAs in human ex vivo acne explants derived from different stages of acne vulgaris. In Specific Aim 3, we will {use the human ex vivo acne explants to evaluate the post-antibiotic adjuvant therapy using the combination of antibiotic and SCFA or ALM, and detect the possible anti-comedogenic and toxic activities of SCFAs.}  We here introduce a new concept that probiotic bacteria within acne lesions express carbohydrate fermentation and produce the SCFAs to rebalance the acne dysbiosis. If successfully, SCFAs naturally produced by commensal bacteria in the human microbiome can be used as antibiotic adjuvants for treatment of various human infections."

"9382430","Summary Type IA or insulin dependent diabetes (T1D) is caused by autoimmune destruction of insulin producing ? cells in the pancreatic islets by T lymphocytes. The detection of IgG autoantibodies to insulin and other ? cell autoantigens in pre-T1D suggests that T-B lymphocyte interactions are a critical early event in the loss of immune tolerance that leads to T1D. Research in this laboratory is focused on the function of B lymphocytes that recognize the key ? cell autoantigen, insulin. By engineering NOD mice to express an insulin autoantibody as a B cell receptor transgene, we discovered that B lymphocytes make unappreciated contributions to the pathogenesis of T1D as antigen presenting cells. Anti-insulin B lymphocytes were found to process and present pathogenic epitopes from insulin B chain to diabetogenic T cells. In all previous studies insulin epitopes were identified by T cell responses to synthetic peptides and natural insulin epitopes on diabetogenic MHCII (IAg7 in NOD and DQ8 in humans) were not know. By combining the novel resource of our anti-insulin B cells with advanced proteomics, we have overcome the barrier to detection of natural insulin epitopes and have discovered an unexpected quantity and quality of insulin-related peptides eluted from IAg7 on anti-insulin B cells. Features of the insulin ?immunopeptidome? differ strikingly from synthetic peptides used to mimic epitopes. Pathogenic B chain motifs are in low abundance relative to other insulin-related epitopes and they reside on larger peptides that may support more complex interactions. Surprisingly, a large majority of insulin- related residues from IAg7 reside in multiple epitope clusters encompassing the c-peptide of proinsulin. These findings suggest: i) natural B chain epitopes may reside on larger polypeptides and drive more diverse responses than detected with synthetic peptides (e.g. B9-23); ii) features of c-peptide epitopes eluted from IAg7 indicate anti-insulin B cells capture proinsulin at the site of attack in the islets; iii) properties of proinsulin c-peptide that favor MHCII loading govern thymic education of anti-insulin T cells. These hypotheses will be tested in three aims of the proposal. First, we will identify naturally processed B chain epitopes from IAg7 on B cells that drive unique autoaggressive T cells in T1D. Second, the role of insulitis in loading proinsulin- peptides onto IAg7 in anti-insulin B cells will be determined, and quantitative proteomics will be developed to test this potential biomarker. Third, the functional significance of proinsulin peptides eluted from IAg7 for generation of beneficial T cells that leave the thymus will be assessed. Each of these aims is positioned for rapid translation into human T1D by providing more effective reagents for detection and regulation of autoaggressive T cells, developing a biomarker of early islet invasion, and identifying T cells better suited for maintaining immune tolerance."
"9412378","Military occupational exposure to blast overpressure from improvised explosive devices can lead to mild traumatic brain injury (blast-TBI), resulting in debilitating persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) and psychological dysfunction, but diagnoses and treatment options are limited. Common PPCS complaints of Veterans with blast histories include both cognitive difficulties and physiological symptoms. Likewise, common psychological dysfunctions include impulse control disorders, substance abuse, post traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety, but the causal mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore, increases in preclinical research efforts using rodent models are required to provide much needed insight into the underlying mechanisms by which blast-TBI contributes to subsequent dysfunction. While rodent models of blast-TBI have largely focused on potential memory-related cognitive effects, no study to date has utilized rodent models to examine the effects of blast exposure on impulsivity or attention, which are common and recurring complaints of blast exposed Veterans and are highly implicated in psychological dysfunction among civilian populations. Likewise, the neuromodulator dopamine plays a critical role in reward processing and decision making, and in civilian populations, perturbations of phasic dopamine release have been implicated in a variety of psychological dysfunctions that are similar in nature to those seen following blast-TBI. Surprisingly, few studies to date have investigated a role for dopamine dysfunction following blast exposure. The current proposal seeks to fill these knowledge gaps and will combine a mouse model of blast-induced TBI, fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to measure subsecond nucleus accumbens (NAc) phasic dopamine release, and behavioral measures of impulsivity and attention. Aim one will examine the near and long-term consequences of single and repetitive blast exposure on the mesolimbic dopamine system using FSCV and electrical stimulation of discrete brain regions. Aim two will examine the near and long-term consequences of single and repetitive blast exposure on measures of impulsivity and attention, and will determine a potential role for augmented phasic dopamine release following blast in these behaviors. In rodent models, maladaptive measures of impulsivity and attention have been linked to an increase in phasic NAc dopamine neurotransmission. Therefore, based on the large number of blast-TBI Veterans presenting with impulsivity and attention impairments and our preliminary data demonstrating a blast-induced increase in impulsivity related behaviors and stimulated phasic dopamine release, we hypothesize that blast exposure will result in increased NAc dopamine release that in turn drives maladaptive measures of impulsivity and attention. These experiments are intended to further our understanding of the behavioral and neurochemical mechanisms underlying blast-TBI dysfunction, and will be an important preclinical step in elucidating potential treatment targets and strategies.  My overall goals of the CDA2 application are: (i) To create a translational research program to investigate the near and long term effects of blast-TBI on subsequent cognitive, psychological and dopaminergic dysfunction. (ii) To develop new skills and understanding of rodent models of blast-TBI, as well as the clinical issues facing Veterans with and without blast-TBI histories so that my research is both informed by and has the potential to inform future preclinical and clinical lines of research. (iii) To gain working knowledge and expertise in statistical techniques for use with advanced behavioral assays and large data sets. (iv) Lastly, by virtue of these goals, to clearly differentiate myself as an independent VA investigator who is both unique from my mentors and complementary to their efforts in helping Veterans with blast-TBI histories."
"9510696","ABSTRACT The enterically transmitted hepatitis E virus (HEV) has a unique dual life style: while shed as non-enveloped virions in feces, it circulates in the bloodstream as quasi-enveloped virions (eHEV). While the quasi- envelopment provides effective protection for free virions against antibodies, our new data suggest that this strategy is not perfect because antibodies are able to neutralize eHEV intracellularly and limit virus spread. In addition, large quantities of viral RNA-free capsid antigen (free antigen) are present both in the supernatant of HEV-infected cells and in the sera of HEV-infected humans and macaques for reasons that are not under- stood. Our preliminary data suggest that the HEV free antigen is produced as a result from translation initiated at an alternative start codon of the capsid gene and is able to reduce antibody-mediated neutralization of HEV. However, it is not essential for the HEV life cycle. We hypothesize that HEV free antigen serves as an antigen decoy to further dampen the host antibody response during HEV infection. Our long-term goal is to better un- derstand the mechanisms by which HEV free Ag modulates host immunity and contributes to HEV pathogene- sis. The objectives of this project are to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying the bulk accumulation of HEV free antigen (Aim 1) and to determine if free antigen functions as an antigen decoy (Aim 2). The completion of this study will fill a significant gap in our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenesis of HEV."
"9468232","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The long term goal of this research is to understand how the ability to use talker voice characteristics to understand speech in multitalker environments develops from childhood to adulthood. The proposed research is designed to characterize the way children are able to utilize acoustic voice cues to separate competing speech in multitalker environments. It is well established that children are more susceptible to competing speech sounds compared to adults and emerging evidence suggests this can have a detrimental impact on learning. In multitalker environments, children?s speech-in-speech understanding can often improve by utilizing the same sound segregation cues as adults. For example, children can benefit from a sex mismatch between competing talkers but the relative contribution of the individual voice characteristics to this benefit is unknown. In this study, we will investigate children?s ability to benefit from talker differences in fundamental frequency (F0) and vocal tract length (VTL), the two primary voice characteristics that differentiate male and female voices. The overall goal of the proposed research is 1) To evaluate the independent effects of target/masker voice differences in F0 and VTL on children?s ability to segregate target from masker speech, and 2) To determine when the ability to benefit from combined differences in vocal characteristics between target and masker speech matures in children. The central hypothesis is that the ability to use differences in voice characteristics to separate target from masker speech follows a protracted pattern of development, and that children will derive less benefit when cues are presented in isolation than when these cues are combined. This central hypothesis will be tested by first isolating F0 and VTL to see their independent influence on speech-in-speech understanding. These two cues will then be combined in order to determine whether cue redundancy could reduce the child/adult differences that are observed in these contexts. Previous research has demonstrated that adults are able to benefit from these two cues and that this benefit extends to adults with hearing loss who wear hearing aids. The findings from the proposed research are expected to lead to a more complete understanding of how acoustic voice characteristics contribute to children?s speech-in-speech understanding and will pave the way for the development of intervention strategies for children with hearing loss."
"9390875","PROJECT-003: MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND CANCER GENETICS PROGRAM (MBCG)  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The Molecular Biology & Cancer Genetics (MBCG) Program at The Ohio State University Comprehensive  Cancer Center (OSUCCC), led by Michael Ostrowski, PhD and Matthew Ringel, MD, unites a highly  productive, collaborative and cancer focused team of 44 basic and translational scientists representing 7  colleges and 18 academic departments at The Ohio State University. Program science is centered in four  major cancer-focused scientific themes: small non-coding RNAs and cancer, human cancer  genetics/genomics, signal transduction and therapeutic resistance, and tumor microenvironment. Program  members utilize state-of-the-art approaches to 1) identify genes and pathways that fuel tumor cell initiation and  growth, and 2) provide mechanistic details of how these genes and pathways contribute to tumor progression  and therapeutic resistance. Our overall goal is to define the mechanisms that account for the association  between genes and cancer and to exploit this knowledge in order to reduce the incidence of death from  cancer.  The Specific Aims of the MBCG Program are: 1) to identify human genes, including non-coding genes such as  those encoding microRNAs, that either through direct mutations or epigenetic mechanisms, result in an  increased predisposition to cancer; 2) to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression and  function of the genes contributing to normal development, cancer progression, and therapeutic resistance; 3) to  utilize the knowledge gained from gene identification and gene functions in tumorigenesis in order to reduce  the incidence of death from cancer.  During the prior funding period of the OSUCCC P30 CCSG, MBCG Program members published 810 research  papers, including 104 high impact (> 10) manuscripts in journals such as Cell, Cancer Cell, Science, Nature  Medicine, Nature Cell Biology, Journal of Clinical Oncology, and Journal of Clinical Investigation.  There is extensive collaboration, with 21% intra-programmatic, 31% inter-programmatic, and 66% multi-  institutional publications. Overall, 81% of MBCG publications are collaborative. MBCG Program members are  principal investigators (PIs) on seven NCI programmatic grants, including a P01 and U01 in breast cancer (P01  CA097189, U01 CA154200), a P01 and P50 SPORE in thyroid cancer (P01 CA124570, P50 CA168505), a  P01 in epigenetics (CA129242) and two U01s in lung cancer (U01 CA152758, U01 CA166905). They are PIs  on CCSG-approved grants whose direct funding is currently $9.39 million, with $7.5 million in NCI funding  (80% of total CCSG-approved funding). Program members are principal investigators on 21 active protocols  that have accrued 5760 patients over the past five years. MBCG studies are predominantly interventional but  non-therapeutic, and non-interventional as most of our interventional therapeutic work is accomplished  collaboratively within the Translational Therapeutics and Leukemia Research Programs."
"9469922","ABSTRACT Each year, over half a million head and neck cancer patients are treated with radiotherapy, which results in the severe dry mouth syndrome, xerostomia, due to co-radiation of healthy salivary glands. Poor quality of life in such patients is a result of conditions associated with xerostomia such as hyposalivation, dental caries, fungal infections, decaying teeth, and taste and masticatory dysfunctions. Current therapies to rescue hyposalivation provide temporary relief and are largely ineffective; thus, new therapies for permanent tissue repair are needed. Our lab has deep expertise in cutting-edge salivary glands stem cell research, and was the first to demonstrate the clinical potential of KIT+ (c-Kit, CD117) stem/progenitor cells in rescuing hyposalivation. However, this population of stem/progenitor cells decreases with age, currently compromising our ability to efficiently use these cells for therapy. Our current work shows that transcription factor SOX10 plays a major role in the proliferation and differentiation potential of KIT+ cells. For example, epithelial depletion of Sox10 results in loss of KIT+ and pro-acinar cells in the fetal stages. However, it is unclear whether SOX10 is required for expansion and multi-potency, i.e. the ability to differentiate into all epithelial cell types, of KIT+ cells through adulthood. Based on existing evidence, we hypothesize that SOX10 plays a central role in the expansion and differentiation of all KIT+ cells. To test this hypothesis, we will lineage trace epithelial KIT+SOX10+ cells in the submandibular gland using inducible mouse systems. We will also assess forced overexpression of SOX10 to expand KIT+ cells. Overall, these studies will elucidate whether SOX10 marks multi-potent KIT+ stem cells, and can be applied to expand KIT+ stem cells. The scientific ideas proposed here will expand our knowledge of salivary gland stem cells, and will significantly improve future hyposalivation rescue stem cell-based therapies."
"9516256","Project Summary/Abstract RNA modification enzymes are ubiquitous among the three domains of life and necessary for the proper function of many cellular RNAs. RNA substrates may be unstructured or highly base-paired as in tRNA or rRNA. Direct inspection of the sequence of highly base-paired RNAs is challenging because of the deep and narrow major groove of the RNA helix. How RNA modification enzymes achieve specificity for highly base- paired substrates is an open question. Two mechanisms feature prominently: protein promoted melting of base pairs to form interactions between the protein and the Watson-Crick faces of nucleotides or protein recognition of a specific three-dimensional RNA shape indirectly driven by RNA sequence. It is previously unknown how general these mechanisms are among RNA modification enzymes and if a few paradigms exist which can explain the specificity mechanisms of many classes of RNA modification enzymes. This proposal will use characterization of the structure and mechanism of the erythromycin resistance methyltransferase enzyme family to address the problem of RNA modification enzyme specificity, moving toward the goal of identifying common mechanistic strategies used for specific modification of highly base-paired RNA substrates. Erythromycin resistance methyltransferase enzymes methylate a specific adenosine residue of rRNA adjacent to the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome sterically occluding the binding of multiple antibiotics that target the ribosome. The enzymes contribute to the significant public health problem of antibiotic resistance and also are an excellent model system for basic science. In Aims 1 and 2, steady-state and pre-steady state kinetics assays will be performed to understand how protein structure and RNA sequence and structure drive specificity. Wild type protein and rRNA substrates will be used along with site-directed mutants of both enzyme and rRNA towards the goal of building a kinetic mechanism for RNA methylation and understanding how specific protein-RNA interactions contribute to the mechanism. Aim 3 encompasses experiments using small- angle x-ray scattering to build a three-dimensional model of enzyme interaction with rRNA. Throughout the Aims we will assay two evolutionarily distinct members of the erythromycin resistance methyltransferase family to determine if there is an idiosyncratic or conserved mechanism for this enzyme family."
"9494914","Summary In contrast to conventional T cells that recognize peptides on MHC proteins, CD1 molecules present lipid antigens to T lymphocytes. The abundant expression of CD1a hallmarks Langerhans cells in the skin, a subtype of dendritic cell with antigen-presenting functions. CD1a is able to bind and display a broad spectrum of lipid antigens derived from exogenous sources, such as bacteria, or host origin. The complex immune system of the skin is critically involved in responses to extrinsic insults like allergens, as well as in autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis. However, the in vivo role of CD1a on Langerhans cells remains enigmatic, since CD1a is expressed in humans but lacking in most animal models. Our hypothesis is that CD1a on Langerhans cells is critical to control inflammatory skin diseases. We will support this hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Investigate the impact of CD1a on inflammatory skin diseases. To overcome the obstacle of CD1a lacking in normal experimental animals, we propose to use human CD1a-transgenic mice to study the impact of CD1a on skin inflammation. In preliminary data, we show that the lipidic substance urushiol from the plant poison ivy induces severe skin inflammation in a CD1a-dependent fashion. The immune response is driven by CD1a- expressing Langerhans cells that elicit the generation of CD4 T cells, producing the inflammatory cytokines IL- 17 and IL-22. Based on these findings, we propose to investigate the in vivo functions of CD1a in models of psoriasis using our CD1a-transgenic system. 2) Elucidate the mechanism of lipid presentation and recognition in skin inflammation. For this purpose, we will analyze antigen specificity (TCR repertoire) of CD1a-restricted T cells. We plan to generate new tools such as CD1a tetramers and novel techniques for lipid loading of CD1a molecules. Further, we will develop new kinetic measurements for binding of lipids to CD1a. Using structural biology, we resolved the crystal structure of the CD1a/urushiol complex. This forms the basis for subsequent structural studies on the ternary complex between TCR and lipids presented by CD1a, and will also help to identify dominant lipid antigens in inflammatory skin diseases. Finally, we aim to translate our findings to the human system and investigate poison ivy responders and patients suffering from psoriasis with regard to their T cell responses mediated by CD1a. To conclude, we propose CD1a as a novel target for future therapeutic strategies against inflammatory skin diseases."
"9412497","Despite significant advances in identifying genes implicated in ASD, the neural circuit mechanisms that contribute to impaired social behaviors and communication in ASD remain elusive. This lack of knowledge represents a critical gap in the development of circuity-based treatment. Social interactions demand complex neural computations, including sensory processing of social cues, decisions to determine appropriate behavioral responses, and planning and execution of the motor programs necessary to enact these behaviors. Using neuroimaging studies, the general structure of neural networks involving amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and ventral hippocampus have been associated with ?social circuitry?. However, their exact neuron ensembles and how they mediate social behaviors remains poorly defined. Our overarching hypothesis is that the functional connectivity of these circuits is altered in ASD. The neural process responsible for social behaviors most likely results from the emergent properties of transiently active neural ensembles in social behavior circuits. In this application, we propose, for the first time, to use novel and innovative tools that enable neurons in these ensembles to be permanently tagged and subsequently manipulated in the living animal. Combining recent advances of Dr. Yong-hui Jiang (PI) and Dr. Fan Wang?s (Co-investigator) groups creates a unique opportunity to explore this direction. Jiang?s group recently produced an autism model with Shank3 complete deficiency by deleting exon 4-22 (?e4-22) that has strong ?construct? and ?face? validity for SHANK3-related ASD. Shank3?e4-22-/- mice recapitulate the ASD-like behaviors with impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as aberrant functional connectivity. Wang?s group developed a highly innovative technique: Capturing Activated Neuronal Ensembles (CANE). This novel technique ?captures? and ?manipulates? neuronal ensembles in mouse brains during behavior interaction. Combining the best autism model and innovative techniques provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore the most important question in modeling autism. We hypothesize that the complete deficiency of Shank3 leads to altered neural ensembles in social circuitry that underlie the observed impaired social behaviors. Our objective is to use the CANE method to identify the neural ensembles that underlie autism behavior in Shank3 mouse model. The causality between impaired circuit and behaviors will be investigated by in vivo recording and optogenetic manipulation. Our study is first application of the CANE method to dissect the social circuity in a genetically modified ASD mouse model and represents the first step toward the development of circuit specific treatment for ASD. More importantly, the success of this project will support a paradigm shift in how we model autism, as well as delineate the circuitry for other behaviors."
"9405607","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of women in the United States and African-American women have strikingly high rates of CVD-related death and disability compared to White women. These stark racial disparities have persisted for decades, have increased among young to middle-aged women, and are not explained by traditional clinical risk factors or socioeconomic status (SES). Racism-related stressors have been proposed as one potential pathway through which race impacts cardiovascular health; but most studies have focused on interpersonal experiences of racism, which may actually underestimate the impact of racism- related psychosocial stress on CVD. The proposed research is designed to determine whether a novel, racism-related stressor -expectations of racism --is a risk factor for early CVD in African-American women. We have compelling cross-sectional preliminary data demonstrating that among African-American women, expectations of racism are associated with measurable indices of CVD; independent of actual experiences of racism, and other forms of psychosocial stress. This application builds upon this prior work by using innovative methodologies from public health and psychology to determine whether, in what contexts, and how this unique psychosocial stressor contributes to CVD risk in African-American women over time. We will examine expectations of racism and increases in early CVD risk over a 2-year follow up in a community sample of 400 healthy African-American women aged 30-45. Early CVD risk will be assessed via changes in carotid intima media thickening (CIMT), a measure of atherosclerosis, and 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), a measure of autonomic physiologic arousal and a potential mechanism linking expectations of racism to IMT. Additionally, because research suggests that expectations of racism are largely influenced by context, we will examine whether associations are more pronounced among women with high (vs. low) levels of exposure to interracial contact (assessed via novel measures of activity spaces that can determine the average percentage of time spent in integrated vs. segregated environments). Finally, in order to determine how high levels of expected racism contribute to physiological responses and psychological distress on a day-to-day basis, we will conduct a daily diary study in a subsample of women, to examine daily ABP reactivity to interpersonal stressors, as well as day-to-day affect. Secondary aims will examine additional psychosocial stressors and cultural resources as potential moderators, and rumination, negative affect and social disconnectedness as potential mediators. Findings from this study will ultimately be used to develop psychosocial interventions to help African-American women at risk for CVD cope with the threat of expected racism."
"9468981","Project Summary & Abstract  The various cellular components of the tumor microenvironment undergo metabolic changes to support tumor growth and metastasis. Cancer metabolism is a clinically relevant and exciting field of study, as it provides additional mechanistic insight into the onset and progression of this disease. An improved understanding of this highly complex process can lead to the development of novel therapies, and characterization of a tumor's metabolic phenotype may provide additional criteria for determining prognosis and therapy selection. Towards the latter, the field of hyperpolarized MRI has emerged with the goal of establishing an imaging modality that can non-invasively measure enzymatic flux in vivo.  One way in which cancer metabolism is altered involves arginine utilization, stemming from the overexpression of various arginase isoforms in cancer cells and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), which is thought to promote cellular proliferation and immunosuppression. Elevated arginase activity in the plasma of cancer patients is associated with increasingly aggressive histological grading, and non-invasive quantification of intratumoral arginase activity with hyperpolarized MRI may be an improved prognostic metric. Furthermore, with the rising population of TAM-depleting immunotherapies, differences in arginase flux before and after the initiation of TAM-depleting therapies may correlate to changes in TAM infiltration and provide insight into therapeutic efficacy, which is another potential application of this modality.  In addition, two arginase isoforms exist (arginase-1, A1, and -2, A2) which differ in cell-type-specific expression and subcellular localization. Cytosolic A1 is favorably expressed in TAMs, whereas mitochondrial A2 is expressed to some degree across most cell types, including cancer cells. The population and concentrations of downstream enzymes also differs between the cytoplasm and mitochondrion, leading to the hypothesis that A1 and A2 have different, cell-type-specific, pro-tumor functions in TAMs and cancer cells. The individual cell-type-specific contributions of A1 and A2 to cellular metabolism and proliferation have yet to be studied in the setting of cancer. With therapies that target arginine metabolism currently in Phase I and II clinical trails, this knowledge will support the development of the future iterations of this class of therapy.  I have optimized the synthesis of [6-13C,6-15N3]-L-arginine as a dual purpose probe for 1) use as a hyperpolarized MRI probe for in vivo arginase activity measurements, and 2) LC/MS-based isotopic tracing metabolomics experiments to test the working hypothesis. Information gained from this project may yield new tools and metrics for patient stratification, and will add to the general understanding of cancer metabolism and its role in cancer cell proliferation, collectively contributing towards the improvement of patient care and providing additional mechanistic insight into this disease. In addition, the skills and knowledge gained from this research proposal and training plan will prepare me to achieve my goal of becoming a physician scientist."

The use of animal models in cancer research, particularly inbred and genetically engineered mice, has increased exponentially over the past several years due to technological advances and completion of the sequencing of the human and mouse genomes. Virtually every OSUCCC member utilizing experimental animal models will need at least some of the services provided by the CPMPSR. The Specific Aims of the CPMPSR are: 1) to provide support for preclinical efficacy and toxicity studies utilizing a variety of animal species; 2) to provide consultative services to OSUCCC investigators for optimal experimental design, sample submission and data analysis, recommendations as needed for various ancillary tests, referrals to other OSUCCC shared resources and cores, and referrals to investigators' laboratories with specific expertise (e.g., more specialized clinical pathology testing, electron microscopy, imaging, behavioral and physiological testing); and, 3) to provide consultations to investigators at the time of grant applications and manuscript submissions by providing details about methods and pathologic findings. The services provided by CPMPSR, directed by Dr. Krista La Perle include macroscopic and microscopic tissue evaluations, clinical pathology testing, comprehensive histology and immunohistochemistry, microscopic slide imaging and quantitative analysis. The CPMPSR also provides comprehensive phenotypic characterization of genetically-engineered mice, including detailed characterization of embryos. Radiography is performed by the CPMPSR to enhance morphologic evaluations on post-mortem specimens. The CPMPSR regularly interacts with other OSUCCC shared resources such as the Microscopy Shared Resource and Biomedical Informatics Shared Resource. Over the past grant period, the CPMPSR was utilized by all five OSUCCC Research Programs studying carcinogenesis and using preclinical models for drug development. CPMPSR provided services to 117 OSUCCC members, and these members accounted for 53% of usage.

"9436940","PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Faculty Diversity in Biomedical Research (K01) is to support Dr. White's development into an independent biomedical researcher and leader in pulmonary disease, genetic epidemiology, pharmacogenetics, and health disparities research with a focus on obese-asthma in minority children. Obese-asthma is a severe asthma phenotype highly prevalent in children; specifically, Latino and African American children carry the majority of the disease burden. Dr. White's long-term career goal is to create a research program centered on the identification of genetic and genomic risk factors associated with risk of obese-asthma and obese-asthma related phenotypes (i.e. exacerbations, drug response) in minority children. The proposed mentored research for this application is to apply an integrative genomics approach to identify common and rare genetic variants, and gene expression patterns, associated with obese-asthma in African American, Puerto Rican, and Mexican American children. To support this research and Dr. White's goal of becoming an independent researcher, this K01 proposal includes formal mentored training through didactic coursework, hands-on internships and tailored tutorials in genomic analysis and health disparities research, immersive workshops in advanced next generation sequencing analysis, R01 grant writing, and responsible conduct in research. This training will be applied to the completion of the proposed research via three specific aims: (1) identify common and rare variants associated with obese-asthma risk using whole genome sequencing data, (2) identify genes that are differential expressed in children with obese-asthma versus those without obese-asthma, (3) use a heuristic approach to prioritize variants associated with obese-asthma in the discovery population in five independent replication populations. To achieve these goals, Dr. White has assembled a multi-disciplinary mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Esteban Burchard, Director of the UCSF Center on Genes, Environment, and Health, and several co-mentors including Drs. Max Seibold, Nadav Ahituv, Noah Zaitlen, Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, and David Erle. The University of California, San Francisco is the ideal environment for the proposed training as it provides access to experts in asthma, genetics, epidemiology, bioinformatics, and world-class biomedical facilities and equipment. Dr. White is an African American statistical geneticist, with a history of productive collaboration with her mentoring team as well as a documented commitment to mentoring young scientists from under-represented minority groups. Completion of the proposed research and career development activities in this application will inform the development of an R01 proposal and enable Dr. White to develop an innovative research program in obese-asthma genetics and genomics. With support from this award, Dr. White can become a leader in genetic epidemiology and continue to serve as a research mentor and role model for young minority scientists."
"9381771","ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY  Nausea and vomiting are frequent and debilitating symptoms experienced by women being treated for breast cancer. These symptoms occur repeatedly due to the surgical procedure, anesthesia during surgery, opioids for pain, adjuvant therapy, especially chemotherapy, and perhaps the disease itself. Current guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology indicate that the goal for treatment-induced nausea and vomiting should be complete control. However, this goal has remained elusive. Results from research show that 20-30% of women continue to experience these symptoms following surgery or chemotherapy, even when well established, evidence based clinical guidelines are followed. Given that over 240,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016, this is a highly significant problem. Treatment-induced nausea and vomiting (TINV) have a profound impact on the health and well-being of women with breast cancer. They are related to significant morbidity (dehydration, wound dehiscence, pain, and immobility), increased length of stay, increased hospital costs and poor patient satisfaction.) Because the factors that influence variability in TINV and the mechanisms underlying TINV are not clearly understood, this innovative study will employ a prospective, comparative design to study 300 women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer (Stage I, II, IIIa) who will be recruited prior to scheduled breast cancer surgery. We hypothesize that substantial variability in TINV occurs during the first year of treatment following surgery for breast cancer, that this variability will cluster into distinct groups and groupings will be explained by individual (age, race, history of nausea and vomiting), disease/treatment (medications) and genomic factors; and co-occurring symptoms (sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety, pain). TINV data, using the nausea and vomiting subscale of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Gastrointestinal (PROMISGI), will be collected prior to initial surgery through one year of treatment. Co- occurring symptoms will be measured using the PROMIS29. TINV is controlled by activation of multiple cellular receptors including those for serotonin, dopamine, histamine, acetylcholine, opioid and substance P. These common neural mechanisms mediate TINV regardless of the etiology and will be the targets for the genomic analysis of this study. An understanding of the precise relationship between these targets and the TINV phenotype, and the stratification of symptoms into subgroups according to their underlying biological mechanisms are required for the development of precision medicine strategies. In addition, a retrospective study using banked samples linked to rich symptom phenotype data (including nausea and vomiting) in women with breast cancer will be completed to address replication of significant genetic findings. The results of this rigorously conducted prospective study will inform subsequent research to develop and test personalized targeted interventions to control TINV in women undergoing breast cancer treatment."
"9481553","Abstract The advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has largely eliminated the incidence of encephalitis-like in- ?ammation in human immunode?ciency virus-1 (HIV-1) patients; however, HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) persists in virologically suppressed patients. HAND is observed in 50% of HIV-1-infected individuals in coun- tries with widespread access to cART [8]. Recent data obtained from humanized mouse models of HIV-1 infection indi- cate that tissue macrophages are a long-lived HIV-1 reservoir even under ef?cacious cART [2, 3], suggesting that tissue macrophages, including microglia and splenic macrophages, can drive chronic in?ammation in their resident tissues. Concurrently, next-generation sequencing technologies have vastly expanded our knowledge of factors that regulate the development and homeostasis of tissue macrophages (e.g., microglia, splenic macrophages, etc) [9, 10, 11], permitting an examination of their relevance to disease processes. Among these is the master regulator transcription factor Mafb, which has been shown to contribute to the expression of tissue macrophage-associated transcripts [12] as well as the repression of anti-viral and immune-related genes [11]. My preliminary data shows that Mafb overexpression in the BV2 microglial cell line upregulates the tissue macrophage-associated transcripts Mertk and C1qa, while significantly reducing TNF-a and CCL4 production in response to stimulation with HIV-1 Tat. The primary goal of this proposal is to determine mechanistically how Mafb suppresses pro-in?ammatory signaling in microglia and whether the MLK3 inhibitor URMC-099 promotes the stability of the Mafb protein under in?ammatory conditions. To this end, I propose two aims. First, I will use an inducible CRISPR/Cas9-based activation (CRISPRa) approach to titrate Mafb expression in BV2 mouse microglia and in C20 human microglia cell lines to determine whether Mafb gene dosage is inversely correlated TNF-a and CCL4 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. I will determine whether Mafb acts as a transcriptional suppressor at these loci using chromatin immunoprecipitation in Mafb-overexpressing microglia and lu- ciferase reporter assays in HEK293T cells. Second, I will determine whether inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) prolongs the half-life of Mafb protein following HIV-1 Tat stimulation of microglia in vitro and in tissue macrophages (including microglia and splenic macrophages) in vivo using HIV-1 infected humanized NOD/SCID/IL2Rgc-/- (hNSG) mice. Altogether, the proposed experiments will identify key roles for Mafb in de?ning features of tissue macrophage physiology, particularly within the context of chronic HIV-1 infection. Accomplishment of these goals may also inform therapeutic strategies for a wide variety of in?ammatory conditions in which tissue macrophages contribute to collateral tissue damage and worsened disease outcomes."
"9420242","Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation?s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140 in number of human proteins and >500 in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward."
"9470555","Cardioprotective RhoA Signaling in Mitochondrial Quality Control Mitochondrial fission and removal of smaller, damaged mitochondria by mitophagy are processes that play a significant role in mitochondrial quality control. Failure to engage mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control under cardiac stress results in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Thus, mitochondrial fission and mitophagy are believed to serve cardioprotective function. Signaling by activation of the small molecular weight GTPase RhoA has previously been shown to prevent activation of mitochondrial death pathways, providing cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury and other cardiac damage. I hypothesize that activation of RhoA directly increases mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, and thus protects against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury through improved mitochondrial control. The proposed goals are to determine the mechanisms of RhoA signaling in regulation of cardiac mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, and to determine the involvement of RhoA regulated fission and mitophagy in cardioprotection from ischemia/reperfusion injury. Preliminary data strongly suggests that RhoA increases mitochondrial fission, and through the downstream kinase target Rho-associated Protein Kinase (ROCK) regulates the mitochondrial fission protein Dynamin-related Protein 1 (Drp1). There is also preliminary evidence that RhoA increases mitophagy, and through the downstream kinase target Protein Kinase D (PKD) regulates the mitophagy protein PTEN-induced Putative Kinase 1 (PINK1). The proposed study would demonstrate that, in addition to the known role of RhoA signaling in cell fate by preventing cardiac cell death signaling, RhoA also sustains mitochondrial quality control under the cardiac damage that would be induced by myocardial infarction, through parallel and cooperative increases in mitochondrial fission and mitophagy."
"9209519","PROJECT SUMMARY Brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, glioma, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis devastate the lives of millions of patients and their families. Despite decades of research costing billions of dollars, these and other brain diseases sorely lack diagnostic tools, effective disease- modifying therapies, adequate symptomatic managements, or even well-defined mechanistic causes. These failures stand out particularly in light of incredible advances in basic scientific knowledge. Thus there is a critical need for clinicians to be involved in basic research on human brain disease since they are well suited to identify new treatments. The University of Iowa Clinical Neuroscientist Training Program is designed as a more efficient pathway to train outstanding neurology and neurosurgery residents in basic research, with the goal of increasing the percentage of trainees who continue in a long career as productive clinician-scientists."
"9613297","SUMMARY (PROJECT 1)  The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) cause the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of  humans, with ~100 million cases annually and over 3 billion people worldwide at risk of infection. A major  challenge in development of vaccines is that whereas infection with one DENV serotype leads to durable  immunity against the same serotype, subsequent infection with a different (heterotypic) serotype is the major  risk factor for severe disease. The mechanisms by which the host immune response to DENV provides either  protection or enhancement in secondary (2) infection are poorly understood. However, the vast majority of 2  DENV infections are asymptomatic, suggesting an effective protective response can be mounted. The overall  approach of Project 1 is to take advantage of unique sample sets from long-term ongoing studies of dengue in  Nicaragua to address complex questions about dengue B cell immunology in a relevant epidemiological  context. It is designed so that the data generated from characterization of the antibody (Ab)/B cell immune  profile can be (1) analyzed in relation to infection outcome and disease severity in Project 1; (2) combined with  CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in the same sample sets (Project 3) to identify immune correlates of  protection in natural infections (Core C), and (3) compared to vaccine-induced Ab/B cell responses and  correlates of protection obtained using the same methodologies (Project 2). Each aim also addresses key  questions in dengue immunology using both polyclonal Ab analysis and monoclonal Abs. The overall  hypothesis is that the protective Ab/B cell response is fundamentally different after a 1 vs. a 2 DENV infection,  and that it is the quality as well as the quantity of neutralizing Abs that determines the protective efficacy. Moreover,  we posit that strongly serotype cross-neutralizing Abs after a 2nd infection are derived from existing memory B cell  (MBC) precursors and target novel epitopes (Core B). Specifically, we hypothesize that neutralizing Abs that are  type-specific and directed to the hinge region of the envelope protein predominate after a 1st DENV infection,  whereas the neutralizing Ab response is directed to serotype cross-reactive epitopes after a 2nd and 3rd infection  (Aim 1). Next, we hypothesize that the quality (e.g., epitope repertoire), breadth, and magnitude of the pre-existing  neutralizing Ab/B cell response will influence the outcome of subsequent DENV infection (disease versus no  disease) (Aim 2). Finally, during an acute 2 infection, we hypothesize that the quality (epitope specificity and cross-  reactivity) and magnitude of the B cell and neutralizing Ab response will correlate with protection against severe  disease (Aim 3). To test these hypotheses, we will characterize the serum Abs and MBC profile after a 1st, 2nd  or 3rd DENV infection, prior to a documented subsequent DENV infection, and during an acute 2 heterotypic  DENV infection. These studies should provide insight as to the B cell/Ab response after natural DENV  infections and generate much-needed immune correlates of protection."

"9441519","PROJECT SUMMARY: The unique susceptibility of pregnant women to influenza virus infection, as well as the ability of maternally-derived immunity to provide fetal/neonatal protection has increased attention to maternal immunization. However, influenza vaccine coverage has been historically lower than expected in this population. Currently, data on influenza vaccine safety and efficacy during pregnancy are inadequate, which could be one of the main reasons for lower vaccination coverage in pregnant women. Initial assessment of the risk-benefit of maternal vaccination in prevention of viral infection requires a comparable animal model. This proposed study will establish a pregnant sow model to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a candidate influenza vaccine during pregnancy. In our previous studies supported by NIH (1R15A1090582), we generated a candidate influenza vaccine (TX98-129), which expresses a chimeric HA derived from HAs of four genetically distinct swine influenza A viruses (H1N1) that had history of zoonotic transmission. In this proposed study, we will perform in vivo evaluation of the candidate TX98-129 vaccine in pregnant sows. Our research team will recruit highly motivated pre-veterinary undergraduate students to participate in the project, in which students will receive broad training in vaccinology and animal model systems. Specific Aims are: 1) To assess the safety and efficacy of the candidate influenza vaccine in pregnant sows and fetal development; 2) To determine the effect of vaccine-induced maternal passive immunity on protecting neonatal pigs from influenza virus infection; 3) To integrate pre-veterinary undergraduate students into the research. Outcomes of this study will provide comparative information on the effect of our candidate influenza vaccine on maternal immunity and fetal development. The pregnant sow/fetus model will be a highly comparative system for future evaluating the effect of vaccines, therapeutic drugs and other treatments on prevention of viral infection during pregnancy, as well as to study their impact on human fetal development and consequences. In addition, the collaborative research environment created in this project will provide multidisciplinary training opportunities for undergraduate students."

"9171067","Project Summary Deaths from suicide continue to be a major public health concern, particularly among youth and young adults, for whom suicide ranks as the second leading cause of death. Despite growing research on suicide, knowledge about the proximal behavioral and psychosocial mechanisms that facilitate the development of suicidal thinking and/or the transition to suicidal behavior. Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is the intentional destruction of body tissue without suicidal intent, typically cutting or burning the skin, and has been identified as a particularly robust risk factor for suicide. Studies find that up to 19% of college students report engaging in NSSI during their college years, placing many at elevated risk for suicide. Remarkably little is known about the temporal course of NSSI and suicide ideation/ behavior, or about why and how NSSI confers its risk for suicide. The proposed study aims to fill these knowledge gaps through an 18-month longitudinal study of self-injuring college students. Using the integrative motivational- volitional theory of suicide as a guide, the current study proposes that the behavioral severity of NSSI, lack of effectiveness of the NSSI in achieving coping functions, and self-identification with NSSI are mechanisms contributing to the development of suicidal ideation. Whereas, habituation to pain and fearlessness about death, attentional bias towards self-injury, and impulsively engaging in NSSI are mechanisms mediating the transition from NSSI to suicide behavior. College students reporting current NSSI will be recruited to complete behavioral-reaction time tasks and self-report measures of the study variables within a laboratory setting at baseline, 6-, 12-, and 18-months post baseline. Latent growth modeling will be used to examine how the proposed NSSI mechanisms mediate changes in suicidal ideation and attempts over time. The results will provide essential information to the field of suicide prevention, and have the potential to significantly impact clinical practice by identifying specific mechanisms and markers of suicide risk that can be translated into assessment and intervention strategies."
"9553881","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective, reliable, and reproducible biomarkers are clearly needed to assist with accurate diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD), especially at early stages, as well as for facilitating differential diagnosis and disease monitoring. The proposal is designed to meet several major challenges of current biomarker research, specifically: 1) significant variations associated with antibody-based protein assays, 2) low sensitivity and specificity of blood based markers, and 3) detection of PD at early stages. To address the problems of antibody-based assays, our strategy is development of targeted mass spectrometry-based techniques, such as selected reaction monitoring (SRM), to identify unique peptide markers derived from proteins either showing promise in previous proteomics profiling, or known to be critical to PD pathogenesis, e.g., ?-synuclein, parkin and LRRK2, in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To facilitate discovery and validation of blood based biomarkers, a specific population of central nervous system derived plasma exosomes, the cargo-carrying microvesicles recognized recently to transport biomolecules among different cells or organ systems, will be isolated before SRM analysis. The unique peptide markers will be tested in several large, well-established cohorts, e.g., Udall Centers affiliated with the University of Washington and University of Pennsylvania, DATATOP (Deprenyl and tocopherol antioxidative therapy of parkinsonism) and PPMI (Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative), with cross-sectional and longitudinal samples collected, along with extensive clinical characterization. Finally, to improve early diagnosis, we will make use of two cohorts consisting of subjects at elevated risk for PD (i.e., asymptomatic subjects with LRRK2 mutations or anosmia/hyposmia), with the goal of discovering biomarkers capable of identifying subjects with early or premotor PD. The studies designed for this project, if successful, have the potential to result in a panel(s of biomarkers that are robust, with less variation than can currently be achieved, and in a body fluid that is readily accessible in a regular clinical setting. Markers for early diagnosis and progression of PD are critical in understanding how to arrest or slow PD progression."
"9456975","Project Summary  Work by early anatomists identified long-range projections from somatosensory cortex that descend to the spinal cord dorsal horn, and these projections have been hypothesized to exert top-down control over somatosensory circuits. However, assessing the function of the somatosensory corticospinal neurons has proved intractable due to a lack of tools necessary for dissection of spinal cord neural circuits.  I propose to use modern molecular genetic tools in conjunction with electrophysiological and behavioral analyses to assess the role of descending corticospinal inputs to the spinal cord dorsal horn. Leveraging anatomical findings using molecular genetic and viral tracing techniques, I will assess how activation of somatosensory corticospinal neurons influences dorsal horn processing of tactile information. To gain insights into the components of corticospinal-recipient circuits, I will silence individual interneuron subtypes within the dorsal horn and ask which subtypes are critical for cortical modulation of afferent input. In behaving animals, I will manipulate the activity of somatosensory corticospinal neurons to ask how these neurons contribute to tactile perception. Together, this work will reveal fundamental roles of descending corticospinal circuitry in the control of tactile information processing, and thus their influence in perception of an animal's tactile environment. Because normal tactile sensation is often disrupted in injury or disease, a better understanding of top-down control may contribute to therapies for mechanical allodynia after peripheral nerve injury, as well as for mechanosensory gating deficits exhibited in schizophrenia and some autism spectrum disorders (ASD)."
"9208006","Summary Throughout its history, the Department of Neurology at Mount Sinai has excelled in training academic neurologists, and is historically #3 by total number and #1 by percentage of trainees among US programs in generating academic neurologists (Arch Neurol. 2011;68(8):999-1004). Over the past decade, the Department has directed itself towards facilitating and improving the training of outstanding neurologist-researchers. Our R25 research residency, first established in 2012, is a burgeoning element for the development of future neurologist-scientists. The present application to renew the NINDS- supported research- resident training program is a cornerstone of an effort that involves all aspects of the department and all stages of career development. Over six years we have recruited sixty new faculty members, including many neurologist-scientists, redesigned the preclinical neuroscience course, developed a 12 week neurology/psychiatry/neuroradiology/neurosurgery/research third year clerkship, increased the size of our residency from 18 to 24 residents, designed a new neuroscience-at-noon neurology residents program taught by faculty from half a dozen departments, established formal residency research and junior faculty mentoring programs, received approval for four new fellowship programs and recruited outstanding academic and research-oriented resident cohorts, two of whom are currently in the program. The PI, Dr. Sealfon, has been continuously funded by NIH for 28 years, has previously directed a T32 program and is wholeheartedly committed to the training of neurologist- scientists. As is typical of our collegial and dynamic institution, our experienced research training faculty is selected from several departments in addition to Neurology. The training program will provide a formal closely-mentored clinical or basic research experience during residency and fellowship to develop the skills, data and publications to submit a career development award and to succeed in a research- intensive department like ours. Success of the program will be judged by the trainees rate of obtaining K08 and K23 awards, their academic placement and their researchcontributions."
"9443293","Summary Osteoporosis has a devastating impact on the health and quality of life of women and men. Several FDA approved drugs are available for the treatment of osteoporosis. However, in the US a low and declining number of patients at high risk for fractures do not receive adequate treatment because of the cost and the side effects of currently available drugs. This trend has generated ?a crisis? in the treatment osteoporosis. Thus, there is a critical need to identify inexpensive, safe and effective interventions for both the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Interestingly, there is strong evidence that the gut microbiome regulates bone homeostasis in health and disease, and that probiotics protect against bone loss. In 2016, we published in JCI that sex steroid depleted germ-free mice do not undergo trabecular bone loss, demonstrating a role of the microbiota in the bone loss induced by sex steroid deprivation. We showed that Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and VSL#3 probiotics completely protected ovariectomized (ovx) mice from bone loss by decreasing bone resorption. Furthermore, these probiotics increased bone mass in estrogen replete controls by stimulating bone formation. New preliminary data confirm that LGG and VSL#3 exert bone anti-catabolic effects in ovx mice, as well as bone anabolic effects in estrogen replete controls. Based on preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that probiotics stimulate bone formation by generating the short-chain fatty acid (SCAFA) butyrate in the gut. Butyrate has been shown to induce regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion in the intestine. We show preliminary data that probiotics, or direct feeding of butyrate, also induces the expansion of the Treg population in the bone marrow (BM). Mechanistically, we show that Treg expansion induces the release of the osteogenic Wnt ligand Wnt10b by BM CD8+ T cells. Wnt10b then activates Wnt signaling in osteoblastic cells, leading to increased bone formation. Our published studies show that probiotics prevent bone loss in ovx mice by reversing an increase in gut permeability induced by ovx. We now hypothesize that probiotics block bone resorption in ovx mice by decreasing gut permeability via activation of ERK dependent signaling pathways in gut epithelial cells, leading to lower intestinal inflammation. We also hypothesize that probiotics block the trafficking of activated immune cells from the gut to the BM. Finally, we show that probiotics can change gut microbiome diversity, suggesting that probiotics prevent inflammation and bone loss in ovx mice by restoring gut microbiota diversity. Our hypotheses will be tested in 3 specific aims: 1) To determine if LGG and VSL#3 probiotics stimulate bone formation in intact mice via a SCFAs/Treg/ CD8+T cells/Wnt10b dependent mechanism, 2) To identify the molecular events at the gut epithelium that mediate probiotic protection against bone loss following sex steroid depletion, and 3) To determine whether probiotics mechanistically influence bone metabolism by preserving a eubiotic microbiome diversity. The outcomes of these studies are relevant to the mission of NIH by addressing novel and inexpensive interventions for osteoporosis."
"9410534","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to identify genes important to schizophrenia. In the first cycle of our project, we demonstrated that damaging de novo mutations in persons with schizophrenia, from otherwise healthy families, disrupt genes that are co-expressed in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during fetal development. Compared to their unaffected siblings, schizophrenia patients were significantly more likely to harbor such alleles. Proteins encoded by these genes functioned in neuronal migration, synaptic transmission, signaling, and transcriptional regulation. Integration of genetic data and expression data suggested possible schizophrenia-related processes and even potential targets for treatment. In the next cycle of our project, we ask whether these and other candidate genes are enriched for severe mutations in schizophrenia, by comparing mutation profiles of each gene for all cases and controls in the NIMH repository. In Aim 1, we will select ~500 candidate genes from among those with de novo damaging mutations in schizophrenia or autism, using network analytic tools to suggest those genes most likely to be causal and to identify other candidate genes. In a preliminary study, we show that an expanded network seeded by the 54 genes with damaging de novo mutations in our cases is significantly enriched for genes involved in chromatin modification and synaptic function, and for genes with de novo mutations in schizophrenia or autism from other studies. In Aim 2, we will sequence 500 candidate genes in DNA from all European American and African American schizophrenia cases and controls from the NIMH repository, ~12,000 subjects total. For each gene, we will sequence coding regions, UTRs, and non-coding potential regulatory regions. We will compare distributions of damaging alleles of cases and controls gene-by-gene and by network-defined functional groups. In a preliminary study, we identified novel truncating mutations in 3 different genes, each in one of 24 patients sequenced for 281 genes from a co-expression network. We use a method of pre-capture pooling and hybridization that yields a sequencing cost per complete gene per sample of 13 cents. In Aim 3, we will use C. elegans to characterize the roles of schizophrenia candidate genes in neurodevelopment. In candidate genes with orthologs in C. elegans, we will measure the consequences of RNAi-reduced expression on neurological phenotypes, including defects in axon guidance, dendritic branching, or neurotransmitter-specific neuron function. Then, for selected human mutations, we will create transgenic animals to examine the consequences of replacing the C. elegans gene with the human mutant vs normal gene. Together, these aims are designed to identify genes or clusters of genes important to schizophrenia."
"9522273","Dissecting the pathways controlling tunable responses to TCR signaling Summary Stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) leads to activation, a process that includes changes in T cell metabolism, survival, proliferation, cytokine responsiveness, migration behavior, and effector functions. Life versus death, as well as lineage decisions of T cells are determined in large part by the strength of TCR signaling. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the transcription factor IRF4 is upregulated by TCR stimulation in CD8 T cells, and that the maximum level of IRF4 achieved is dependent on the strength of TCR signaling via the Tec kinase ITK. In turn, IRF4 promotes T cell differentiation into massively proliferating antiviral effector cells in a dose-dependent manner. Yet, mechanistic insight into how TCR stimulation produces a dynamic range of responses defined by distinct gene expression patterns is currently lacking. Our preliminary studies indicate that the Tec kinase ITK is a focal point for the tunable component of TCR signaling. Previous studies showed that ITK is not required for all TCR signaling; instead, in its absence, TCR signaling is significantly reduced. From these studies, the clear function of ITK was difficult to discern, as some aspects of T cell activation appeared normal in the absence of ITK, whereas other T cell functions were greatly impaired. Our current data, using IRF4 upregulation as an example of TCR tuning, provide a framework to understand these apparent discrepancies. These studies have revealed that variations in antigen density and in TCR affinity can modulate gene expression patterns shortly after activation of naive CD8 T cells. Dissecting these pathways shows that the two second messengers generated by activation of phospholipase C-?, the major substrate of ITK, cooperate to regulate all-or-nothing (digital) versus graded (analog) responses to changes in TCR signal strength. The relative balance of these differing inputs determines which responses exhibit the broadest range of tunability to TCR signaling. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the magnitude of ITK activity is determined by the multiplicity of ITAM phosphorylation at the TCR, and that variations in ITK activity tune the calcium response that regulates transcription factor activation. Further, we propose that ITK- dependent tuning of TCR signal strength controls a program of gene expression that is established within hours after TCR stimulation, and thus impacts the differentiation pathways of activated cells. To test these hypotheses, we propose to determine how variations in TCR signal strength lead to graded versus digital expression of entire programs of gene expression at the global and single cell level, and how these patterns are established by the first wave of transcriptional activation following T cell stimulation. We will also assess whether the magnitude of ITAM phosphorylation regulates the dynamic range of ITK-dependent TCR signaling. Finally, we will examine whether the full dynamic range of ITK-dependent TCR signaling is required to generate a broad repertoire of pathogen- specific T cells that provide enhanced responses to variants of the primary infecting pathogen. These experiments will provide important insights into the downstream consequences of alterations in TCR signal strength, allowing a more informed approach to manipulating T cell activation pathways for applications in the fields of vaccinology and immunotherapy."
"9390066","Abstract Our proposal investigates mechanisms of ?2-adrenergic receptor (?2AR) dysfunction that underlies airway hyper-responsiveness in asthma accounting for paradoxical loss of asthma control observed with frequent use of ?-agonist. Asthma pathology is associated with elevation of nitric oxide (NO) and indeed, patients with higher fraction of exhaled NO (FENO) have greater hyper-reactivity and airflow obstruction with paradoxical loss to ?-agonist challenge and re-challenge (Bonini et al., AJRCCM, 2013). ?-agonist activation of ?AR causes airway smooth muscle relaxation via cAMP in parallel leading to ?AR phosphorylation, desensitization and internalization. ?AR desensitization is well understood but mechanistically, little is known about ?2AR resensitization to recover active ?2ARs on cell surface. We recently uncovered mechanisms regulating ?2AR reactivation pathway wherein, dephosphorylation/reactivation of the ?2AR by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is blocked by phosphoinositide 3-kinase ? (PI3K?), which serves to inhibit ?2AR resensitization limiting ?AR response in the cell to ?-agonist [PI3K?-PP2A axis] (Vasudeven et al., Mol Cell, 2011). It is not known whether desensitization and/or resensitization mechanisms underlie the loss in ?- agonist response with elevated NO in asthma. Contrary to NO mediating ?2AR desensitization via S- nitrosylation of proteins, our preliminary data in primary murine airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) reveal that NO causes ?2AR dysfunction not via desensitization rather, via resensitization pathways. NO activates PI3K? by S-nitrosylation of PI3K? blocking PP2A activity thereby, inhibiting ?2AR resensitization. Further, PP2A activity is determined by its methylation and we find that nitrosylated PI3K? inhibits PP2A activity in part by de-methylation. Consistently, primary ASMCs from asthmatic patients have markedly more intracellular phosphorylated-?2ARs, less cAMP response to ?-agonist, greater PI3K? activity and lesser PP2A activity compared to non-asthmatics at plasma membrane and endosome. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that NO inhibits ?2AR resensitization by nitrosylation/activation of PI3K? which inhibits PP2A and limits ?2AR reactivation in asthmatic airways with high NO. The result is cumulative loss of functional cell surface ?2ARs, pre-disposing cells to greater sensitivity for broncho-constrictors, i.e. airway hyper-reactivity (AHR). In strong support of our hypotheses, PI3K? null (PI3K?-/-) mice have minimal AHR, and AHR returns in the PI3K?-/- upon PP2A inhibition. To address our hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively determine the effects of elevated NO on ?2AR resensitization (Aim1) and its role in airway hyper-responsiveness (Aim 2), and to identify mechanisms of NO-mediated non-canonical activation of PI3K? that inhibits PP2A and ?2AR resensitization in asthma (Aim 3)."
"9459996","ABSTRACT Sporadic point mutations and large copy number variants (CNVs) contribute significantly to the etiology of autism but most of the genetic architecture has not yet been understood. Most CNVs associated with autism are large and the majority of pathogenic genes have not been proven. The goal of this proposal is to significantly increase the yield of high-impact autism mutations by focusing on the discovery of understudied classes of rare variants from whole-genome sequence data being generated from 35,000 samples from autism families. This proposal focuses on rare, gene-disruptive mutations and leverages the additional sensitivity afforded by whole-genome shotgun sequencing data, novel CNV discovery methods, and particular patterns of gene-disruptive and missense mutation to increase yield of pathogenic mutations. Our target will include the discovery and validation of smaller and more complex structural variants (including CNVs), clustered de novo missense mutations, and private, gene-disruptive mutations transmitted preferentially from mothers to sons. We will test these candidates by rapid targeted sequencing in 15,000 additional cases where patient recontact and familial follow-up is possible. We propose to select 10 genes with the highest burden of mutation for further clinical evaluation, phenotypic variability, and comprehensive genetic characterization. This proposal specifically focuses on application of novel genomic methods, recurrent mutations, and inheritance patterns to discover pathogenic variants in order to develop a more sophisticated model to explain the genetic architecture of autism. As part of this effort, we will quantify and compare the risk of different classes of mutation for autism and investigate transmission disequilibrium differences depending on the parent of origin and gender of proband. The end product of this analysis will be the identification and characterization of new classes of highly penetrant genic mutations that contribute significantly to etiology of autism, providing targets for clinical diagnostics and future therapeutics."

While recent studies challenge this conventional wisdom, raising the possibility that that some lineages of P. vivax may have evolved to use receptors other than Duffy for erythrocyte invasion, there is scarce evidence to this notion and the intrinsic invasion mechanism is largely unknown. In this Academic Research Enhancement Award (AREA) R15 proposal, we will examine the genetic basis of erythrocyte invasion and ligand-receptor interactions of P. vivax in Duffy negative humans. There are two specific aims: 1) to identify genetic variants of Plasmodium vivax between Duffy positive and Duffy negative individuals by whole genome sequencing, and 2) to investigate the binding activity of genetic variants identified in Aim 1 and other potential erythrocyte-binding proteins in Duffy negative individuals. As our study sites in Ethiopia have a large number of P. vivax cases and a significant proportion of Duffy negative individuals, we have a unique opportunity to study the biology and transmission of P. vivax in Africa with predominantly Duffy negative individuals. This integrative, multi-disciplinary project will offer tremendous opportunities for field-based, hands-on laboratory, and bioinformatics research experiences to both undergraduate and graduate students in the Department of Biological Sciences. Moreover, this award will strengthen the research environment and inter-departmental collaborations within UNCC. The issues addressed in this application are paramount to the understanding of P. vivax epidemiology and disease burden. Some P. vivax strains could have evolved the ability to infect Duffy negative Africans and these parasites may become an emerging cause of severe disease across Africa. This research will provide genomic information of P. vivax from endemic Africa and identify alternative erythrocyte- binding ligands that allow P. vivax to infect Duffy negative individuals. Our findings may reveal novel vivax erythrocyte invasion mechanisms and will significantly advance our understanding of malaria parasite genetic variation and evolution."
"9481635","PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this grant application is to request funds to partially support planning, organizing and hosting HIV Research for Prevention 2018: Vaccine, Microbicide and ARV-based Prevention Science Conference (HIVR4P), international conference. HIVR4P 2018 is the third in this conference series, the world's first and only scientific meeting dedicated to biomedical HIV prevention research. Its primary goals are to help create opportunities for trans-disciplinary interactions in biomedical prevention research; expand discussions of crosscutting issues as new HIV prevention options are developed, and increase coordination and communication among international groups. The pursuit of effective biomedical HIV prevention options has progressed further and faster in the last few years than at any time since the epidemic began. Breakthroughs in vaccines, ARV-based microbicides, monoclonal antibody injections, PrEP, treatment for prevention and other prevention technologies create new opportunities to reduce the impact of the global epidemic. This progress also brings opportunity for scientific debate and creates new challenges as we continue to move HIV biomedical prevention research forward. Most importantly, these advances teach us that effective HIV prevention will require a combination of approaches. This third biennial meeting will take place 22?25 October 2018 at the Madrid Marriott Auditorium Hotel & Conference Center, in Madrid, Spain. This international conference will once again bring together researchers, advocates, clinicians, policy makers, private sector partners and public health experts to present, discuss, and debate the latest research in ARV-based prevention, vaccines and related areas of HIV prevention. It will build on and link to the successes of the previous conferences. The 2018 conference will continue to drive greater coordination, cross-fertilization and increased collaboration. It will also provide a forum to address cross-cutting issues, emphasizing the importance of combination prevention, and it will break down any existing research siloes between different prevention technologies. HIVR4P 2018 will have a significant impact on the advancement of scientific research in unique prevention areas with the potential to make significant progress in the prevention of HIV infection. The conference will attract between 1,400?1,500 members of the HIV prevention community and will provide 200 full and 100 partial scholarships as well as subsidized registration rates for early-career and lower-middle income country (LMIC) scientists. Information presented at the conference will be disseminated to give free, worldwide access to all who are unable to attend in person. Peer-reviewed abstracts will be published online in an open access journal, and posters will be available online as e-posters. All sessions will be available as webcasts and daily rapporteur reports summarizing scientific advances will be posted on the conference website."

"9508720","ABSTRACT Monoclonal antibodies are used to treat various human diseases by binding and inhibiting disease associated antigens, but many antibodies with proven in vitro activity fail to exhibit efficacy in vivo. Some of the most difficult targets to inhibit in vivo include the molecules that have a high rate of synthesis, which require high doses of antibody for treatment. Because antibody binding stabilizes the antigen through endosomal recycling, a high affinity antibody tends to increase the target antigen concentration compared to the baseline (i.e. no antibody), making it progressively more difficult to neutralize the antigen. In this regard, an antibody that can inhibit an antigen without increasing its serum stability may exhibit improved in vivo efficacy. In particular, reducing the serum concentration of a pathogenic antigen using an engineered antibody should provide therapeutic benefits. We propose to engineer such antigen clearing antibody by introducing mutations for pH dependent (PHD) antigen binding. A PHD antibody with high affinity at neutral pH and weaker affinity at acidic pH can eliminate an antigen by forming a stable antibody-antigen complex in the serum that dissociates in the endosome after endocytosis. Dissociated antigen is sorted to the lysosome for degradation, while the antibody is recycled by binding to endosomal neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). The pH dependent interaction is used by some natural receptor-ligand complexes to remove circulating ligands, supporting the generality of this strategy for removing circulating antigens. We will further engineer the antibody to bind FcRn with increased affinity at pH 7.4 to improve the efficiency of antibody capture at the cell surface. Increasing the FcRn affinity is predicted to overcome a kinetic bottleneck due to fluid-based endocytosis and accelerate the rate of antigen endocytosis and degradation, further potentiating the antigen clearing capability of PHD antibody. In this proposal, we will evaluate the use of an engineered PHD antibody in the treatment of Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) intoxication. SEB is a virulence factor secreted by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) that cause infection in crowded communities and hospitals. Since SEB can cause a toxic shock at a low concentration, treatment of SEB intoxication should include inhibition and elimination of circulating SEB. Current treatment options for SEB intoxication include antibiotics to inhibit bacterial growth and synthesis of SEB, but antibody-based immunotoxicotherapy against the toxin is not clinically available. Considering that SEB causes food poisoning and is a known bioterrorism agent, there is an urgent need for effective treatment against SEB intoxication. We will engineer and test if PHD anti-SEB antibody can lower the SEB concentration in mice under transient and steady-state infection conditions. We will also measure the secretion of SEB-induced inflammatory cytokines and the survival rate of mice after SEB injection to determine the efficacy of the antibody. The proposed study is the first of its kind in which an engineered PHD antibody is used to treat a toxin-induced disease, and it is expected to generate important molecular insights to guide future development of novel antibody therapeutics."
"9470160","Project Summary/Abstract Periodontal disease affects up to 47% of the adult population in some form and is linked to a number of serious systemic diseases. Despite the significant health and economic burden of periodontal disease, much remains unknown about the effect of the dysbiotic bacterial community and immune response in the oral cavity. Treponema denticola, along with Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis, compose the ?red complex? of bacteria, prominently associated with severe periodontal disease. The major outer sheath protein (Msp) of T. denticola is known to dysregulate functions of host cells, including neutrophils. Neutrophils are key cells of the body's innate line of defense against pathogens in the gingival tissue, yet during periodontal disease, they are rendered ineffective. Regulation of phosphoinositides (PIPs), important cellular lipid metabolites, through appropriate lipid kinase and phosphatase activity are crucial to orchestrating neutrophil function and driving the immune response. Msp upsets the cellular PIP balance through inhibition of PI3K and activation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Despite being one of T. denticola's most prominent virulence factors, the exact mechanism behind Msp's ability to limit neutrophil chemotaxis by manipulating the PI3K/PTEN lipid metabolism pathway is not well understood. We hypothesize that exposure to Msp, in isolated form or as a component of outer membrane vesicles, will limit neutrophils from responding to T. denticola, but also secondarily to other members of the ?red complex?, promoting bacterial interaction and survival of the polymicrobial biofilm in the oral cavity. The overall objective of this project is to characterize how T. denticola impairs neutrophil function as a means to dysregulate the innate immune response, with the goal to identify the mechanism by which Msp interferes with PI3K signaling and phosphatase activation and characterize how the interaction of Msp with neutrophils supports the dysbiotic bacterial environment of severe periodontal disease. These goals will be accomplished by 1) determining the role of Msp in activating the lipid phosphatase SHIP1 and how Msp interacts with different isoforms of the lipid kinase PI3K to alter normal neutrophil signaling response and 2) characterizing the impact of T. denticola and Msp interaction with neutrophils to alter the ability of neutrophils to respond to other pathogens. This work will fill a gap in knowledge of the pathogenicity of T. denticola and its role in driving the manipulation of the neutrophil response in polymicrobial infections. Furthermore, the mentoring and training plan outlined in this proposal will aid in the attainment of the professional skills necessary to develop a successful independent academic research program in the future."
"9504038","Enteropathogen infections in the first two years of life?with or without acute symptoms?are associated with serious morbidities, including diarrhea, gut impairment, growth faltering, and cognitive deficits. A critical current question in the field of enteric diseases research is why some enteric infections are symptomatic and some are asymptomatic. Characteristics of the infant gut microbiome may influence the course of enteric infections, but the implications of microbiome-enteropathogen interactions are not well understood. Increasing data suggests that cumulative enteropathogen infections early in life, even when asymptomatic for diarrhea, are associated with chronic gut conditions, such as environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), that influence child health. In this study, we will test the hypothesis that gut microbiome characteristics are associated with differential responses to enteropathogen infections for acute and chronic child health outcomes by carrying out a community-based birth cohort study of 360 newborn infants from three sites along a rural-urban gradient in northern coastal Ecuador. This setting provides an ideal location to examine interactions between the gut microbiome conditions and enteric infections, because we leverage a population where our team has worked for 15 years that is a high enteric pathogen transmission setting with known variability in gut microbiome characteristics yet relative similarity in other social, behavioral and genetic factors that might determine host response to enteric infections. We will use state-of the-art diagnostic and genomic techniques to characterize enteropathogen infections and gut microbial communities at multiple time points over their first two years of life, controlling for other factors related to delivery mode, diet, and nutritional status that are known to be associated with gut conditions. Through this approach, we will isolate the effects of the gut microbiome on the health impacts of enteropathogen infection. The differences in microbiome diversity that we have previously observed between urban and rural sites also provides the opportunity to examine the environmental determinants of gut microbiome composition and development in infants. Our specific aims (SAs) are designed to provide important insights into: SA1) how environmental conditions affect the developing infant gut microbiome and pathobiome; SA2) whether the infant gut microbiome modifies the acute (diarrhea) and chronic (EED and growth faltering) outcomes of enteric pathogen infection; and SA3) how the gut microbiome responds and recovers from enteric pathogen infection. This project moves beyond the discovery phase of gut microbiome studies by concurrently studying gut microbiome and health outcomes to gain insights into functional implications of gut microbiome conditions. The results will guide environmental interventions and development of preventative and therapeutic approaches to improve child health outcomes, and will provide information to identify the signatures of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in microbial communities of the gut."
"9456064","Ray PA-16-162 Project Summary Eczema is a chronic skin inflammatory disease infecting 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults and increasing. Researchers have struggled to understand the genetic and environmental factors that appear to play a role in eczema's increasing prevalence. The majority of current studies focus on one or two specific types of Genome-wide data in association with eczema such as SNPS, DNA methylation levels, or gene expression levels. Current statistical methods have forced this limitation as none exist, to our knowledge that allow clustering of subjects across multi-dimensional and multi-faceted variables. Therefore, in this project we aim to introduce a novel clustering approach that will cluster subjects across genes which contain SNP information, DNA methylation levels, and gene expression levels. Summarized clusters will then tested for associated risk of eczema or any allergic disease. Genetic patterns associated with eczema will then be further explored to better identify the behavior genetic data and it's uniqueness. The method will be built in R Gui as a free downloadable package making it accessible and easy to use. We will apply the proposed method to the third generation Isle of Wight cohort data. The third generation cohort data consist of children born (2010-current time) from the original cohort of children born between 1989 and 1990 on the Isle of Wight in the UK and contains Genome-wide datasets, disease and exposure status, and allergy information across multiple follow-ups. The implications of this study not only impact the statistical field with a new clustering approach but the eczema and allergy field as well as no other studies have been able to analyze three Genome-wide datasets in concert associated with the risk of allergic diseases."
"9627020","ABSTRACT A major goal in clinical neuroscience is to develop efficient treatments to prevent or minimize the loss of brain function caused by pathological decreases or increases of neuronal activity, which are hallmarks of a wide variety of neurological disorders. Interestingly, in some instances, the brain has evolved mechanisms to partially correct abnormal neuronal function. Understanding the adaptive mechanisms that restore brain function would not only provide insight into the functioning of the normal brain but also guide future approaches to ameliorate loss of brain function caused by disease or injury. We propose to start a research program to investigate the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which the brain maintains constant behavioral output, even when neuronal activity is naturally variable or it is perturbed. Our preliminary evidence with songbirds indicate that the brain circuits involved in song production demonstrate a high level of behavioral resilience both at short and long timescales. At the short timescale the patterns of firing of premotor neurons directly involved in song production vary from day to day, although there is no measurable variability in the song. At the long timescale, we genetically perturbed the activity of these premotor neurons and this caused a dramatic disruption of song. However, manipulated birds fully recovered from the perturbation, and were able to produce their original song after around 10 days. We will build on these results to explore the neuronal mechanisms that ensure behavioral resilience in a brain circuit involved in a complex behavior using gene delivery, optogenetics, in vivo functional imaging, behavioral analysis, and computational modelling."
"9397983","Mild but isolated closed head injury is typically thought to have no long-term sequelae, with rapid recovery and no defined injury on a clinical head CT scan. Short-term neurological problems include changes in memory, alertness, cognitive function, concentration, but these typically recover within 7-10 days. This period has clear EEG, vascular and metabolic changes, which clear over time. However, if further traumatic brain injury [TBI] episodes occurs shortly after the first (within 1-2 days) then the outcome is more limited and multiple mild, TBI episodes may give rise to post-traumatic encephalopathy. Post-traumatic encephalopathy has components of axonal injury, microvascular changes due to local vessel shearing and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and neuronal damage. Our proposal will address mechanisms of brain dysfunction and treatment associated with multiple closed head injury episodes. Our hypothesis is that closely spaced closed head injury episodes (ie, every 24 hours, total of 3 occurrences) will result in chronic, irreversible behavioral, metabolic, neurovascular, and physiological changes to the brain, in comparison to more widely spaced (every 10 days) closed head injury episodes (also 3 occurrences). Further, we hypothesize that delayed brain stimulation, using either extracranial (diffuse) or intracranial (focused, fornix/septum) stimulation (for 1 month, at 3 months after the injury episodes) will enhance recovery responses, leading to improved memory and physiological function which outlasts the stimulation period. We will analyze underlying mechanisms of long-term impairment following repeated (X 3) mild, closed head injury (ie, concussion). This will be accomplished by comparing the outcome of three injury conditions: sham controls; animals exposed to repeat injury (3 total episodes) occurring over short a time interval (every 24 hours); and, animals exposed to repeat injury (also 3 episodes) occurring over longer time intervals (every 10 days). After a period of recuperation we will evaluate the effects of delayed (at 3 months after injury episodes) intermittent brain stimulation, using either extracranial electrodes or intracranial septal/fornix electrodes, with stimulation over 4 weeks to enhance recovery and hippocampal plasticity after the head injury. We will assess the outcome at 5-6 months with multiple types of behavioral testing and physiological analysis using a comprehensive, in vivo hippocampal physiological approach. Mechanisms to be studied in this acute, in vivo preparation will include assessment of brain metabolism, neurovascular coupling, hippocampal plasticity (long-term potentiation) and cholinergic innervation. We anticipate these data will help understand pathophysiology associated with repetitive concussion and possible treatment methods to enhance recovery of function and brain plasticity."
"9402117","The purpose of this ancillary project is to evaluate prolonged sedentary behavior as a potential therapeutic target for intervention after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). More than 1.1 million patients are hospitalized annually for ACS in the United States alone. With the advent of new technologies and medications, most patients hospitalized with an ACS survive, however they remain at high risk for recurrent cardiac events and mortality; underscoring a critical need to identify prognostic risk factors that can be targeted for intervention. One such risk factor may be sedentary behavior. Evidence suggests that sedentariness is a ?toxic? health behavior (and not merely the absence of physical activity), conferring pathophysiological changes that greatly contribute to morbidity/mortality risk. ACS patients are particularly prone to high volumes of sedentariness after hospitalization; accruing, on average, 12-13 hours/day, with many exceeding 15 hours daily. This raises the question as to whether reducing sedentary behavior may represent another therapeutic target for secondary prevention of ACS patients independent from, and in addition to, physical activity. No existing guidelines for secondary prevention in ACS patients, however, mention sedentary behavior as a risk factor to be treated. This omission may be due to a lack of empirical evidence, as no study to date has assessed whether objectively- measured sedentary behavior incurs increased morbidity/mortality risk post-ACS, independent of cardiac disease severity and physical activity. The NHLBI-funded ?Post-Hospital Syndrome? (PHS) study provides a unique opportunity to evaluate sedentary behavior as a prognostic risk factor among ACS survivors. This study comprises a cohort of 1,000 ACS patients who present to the emergency room and are followed throughout their hospital stay to determine whether in-hospital stress, sleep, physical activity, and/or weight loss are associated with 30-day rehospitalization. In this ancillary study, we propose to additionally measure sedentary behavior objectively for 30 days post-discharge among 862 PHS study patients using triaxial accelerometers that can distinguish both posture and movement. We will also ascertain ACS recurrence and mortality at 1-year follow-up. Finally, we will assess biomarkers of inflammation, procoagulant activity, and dyslipidemia in- hospital and at 1-month follow-up. These data will be used to primarily evaluate whether objectively-measured sedentary behavior is associated with risk of 1-year recurrent events/mortality among post-ACS patients. These data will also be used to inform future interventions to reduce sedentary behavior among ACS survivors by (1) determining the type of activity (standing or walking) that sedentary-reduction strategies should be targeting, and (2) identifying an intermediary target (e.g. inflammation, procoagulant activity, dyslipidemia) to assess intervention efficacy. The results of this study could have a major impact on secondary prevention guidelines for ACS patients by determining whether they should be modified to promote reductions in sedentary behavior. Thus, our findings could have a powerful, sustained impact on public health."
"9528032","Project Summary The candidate in this Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award (K25) will be supported in training and research as she makes the transition from mathematics to microbiology. This candidate will combine rigorous training in the ?eld of microbiology with her quantitative and mathematical skills in order to gain an in- depth understanding of bacterial virulence factors associated with in?uenza infection. The training and research will be performed in the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital under the mentorship of Dr. Jonathan McCullers (experimental microbiology) and co-mentorships of Dr. Frederick Adler (theoretical population biology, University of Utah) and Dr. Alan Perelson (theoretical virology and immunology, Los Alamos National Laboratory). The candidate's long-term goal is to establish research independence at the interface of experimental and theoretical microbiology. The objective and goal of this research plan is to de- termine the relative contributions of Streptococcus pneumoniae genes to pathogenesis of in?uenza infections through experimental and theoretical methods and tools. The K25 award will support a research and training program that includes intensive coursework, attendance at conferences, meetings and seminars, hands-on train- ing in experimental microbiology, and a research plan that provides detailed quantitative studies to understand the host-pathogen interactions during bacterial infections in in?uenza-infected hosts. The proposed framework integrates targeted experimental studies, inference of population genetics, and rigorous mathematical modeling. The speci?c aims of this proposal are to: (1) perform experimental in vivo studies of in?uenza-S. pneumoniae infections in mice, (2) develop/re?ne mathematical models and computational simulations of the kinetics of viral- bacterial interactions, and (3) analyze data, estimate parameters and test speci?c hypotheses with regard to the in?uenza-S. pneumoniae dynamics. In the experimental studies, we will measure the ?tness, frequency, and pathogenicity of bacterial mutants produced within the contexts of naive infections and in?uenza infections. Using the mathematical models and simulation, the data will be analyzed in order to obtain quantitative information about the kinetic differences of each individual bacterial mutant and of the entire population of mutants. The it- erative combination of experiments, mathematical models, and computational simulations will result in a detailed and quantitative understanding of the viral-bacterial coinfection dynamics. Such an approach is of critical impor- tance to understand the complex interplay of viral-bacterial interactions and for identi?cation of novel targets for vaccine and antimicrobial development expected to be important to combat these pathogens."
"9504994","Abstract Q fever is a worldwide zoonotic disease that is caused by the obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium, Coxiella burnetii. Human Q fever can develop into a severe chronic, potentially fatal disease. However, there is no vaccine commercially available for prevention of human Q fever in the US. Additionally, it is difficult to treat chronic Q fever patients with various antibiotic regimens. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an emergency alternative prophylactic and therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of Q fever. This application aims to prove the concept that monoclonal antibody can be utilized as a prophylactic and therapeutic strategy against intracellular bacterial pathogens. Despite C. burnetii being an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen, our recent work demonstrated that passive transfer of a phase I lipopolysaccharide specific monoclonal antibody 1E4 conferred significant protection against C. burnetii aerosol infection in SCID mice and a humanized variable fragment of 1E4 (huscFv1E4) was able to inhibit C. burnetii infection in mice and human macrophages. These results demonstrate the utilities of huscFv1E4 as a rapid, effective emergency treatment for control of Q fever. Thus, the objective of this application is to further prove the feasibility of using huscFv1E4 for effective emergency prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against Q fever. Two specific aims were designed to test the central hypothesis that passive administration of huscFv1E4 will provide immediate protection against C. burnetii infection. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of huscFv1E4 against C. burnetii aerosol infection in mice. Specific Aim 2 will examine if huscFv1E4 alone or combination with antibiotic would be more effective for treatment of C. burnetii infected mice. As an outcome of this study, we expect to prove the feasibility of using huscFv1E4 for prevention and treatment of Q fever. This will have significant positive effects on human health, because it is the critical step towards developing effective emergency prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for control of Q fever."
"9390852","CORE-013: PROTEOMICS SHARED RESOURCE (PSR) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The OSUCCC Proteomics Shared Resource (PSR) provides CCSG investigators access to advanced mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation, ancillary instrumentation for sample preparation, and expert staff to enable proteomic research, including data analysis. Two tenured faculty experts in mass spectrometry and proteomics, Drs. Michael Freitas (MBCG) and Vicki Wysocki, serve as PSR Director and Senior Faculty Advisor, respectively. They provide scientific leadership to the PSR with expertise in cancer proteomics, protein chemistry, bioinformatics, and mass spectroscopy methods development. The PSR offers numerous proteomics services to users that fall under the categories of protein identification, characterization, and quantification. The ability to confidently identify proteins is the central role of the PSR. Examples of protein characterization analysis include: identification of post-translational modifications, alternate splice forms, de novo protein sequencing and protein-protein interaction analysis. The Specific Aims of the PSR are to: 1) provide advanced mass spectrometry based proteomics services; 2) provide innovative proteomic data analytics and bioinformatics platforms; and, 3) provide consultations with investigators on experiment design and train users on the operation of several self-operated MS instruments within the shared resource. Over the last grant period, there have been substantial upgrades to equipment in the PSR. Early in the grant period, three mass spectrometers were acquired with the help of federally funded awards: a Bruker Maxis Q-TOF, a Bruker UltrafleXtreme MALDI TOF-TOF, and a Bruker AmaZon ion trap with electron transfer dissociation (ETD). This year, three additional mass spectrometers, two high-end instruments (a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion and a Bruker 15 T FTICR along with a Thermo Quantiva triple quadrupole for targeted (MRM) analyses) are to be installed in the PSR with funding from two NIH S10 awards and also OSUCCC and other institutional support. These state-of-the-art MS instruments will improve services offered to OSUCCC members by providing significantly higher throughput shotgun proteomics, improved post-translational modification analysis, improved isotopic fine structure analysis for metabolomics, and greater capacity and data quality. The PSR has supported 37 OSUCCC members from all five OSUCCC research programs including 1 K24, 1 N01, 8 P01s, 2 P50s, 19 R01s, 8 R21s, 2 RC2s, 1 T32, and 2 U01s. The PSR has also contributed to over 74 OSUCCC member publications during the last grant period, 11 of which were in publications with a journal impact factor >10. The future plans for the PSR involve a constant effort to develop and adopt new innovative techniques and methods for protein analysis, and to acquire state-of-the-art mass spectrometry and chromatography instrumentation. Specifically, the PSR will fully integrate the 3 recently purchased major instruments, to introduce methods for 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional chromatography, and provide proteogenomics data integration. The PSR leverages extensive institutional support, and seeks only 14.2% support from CCSG funds. The Proteomics Shared Resource is part of the Analytics Grouping."
"9434620","Abstract Heart failure and arrhythmias occur together, are marked by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and are major, unsolved public health problems. Despite this, ROS can be beneficial. However, clear molecular mechanisms supporting the benefits of ROS are lacking. The potential for ROS to be ?good and bad? is called the ROS paradox. This Outstanding Investigator Award application will propose innovative approaches to understanding and dissecting healthy from pathological ROS. The goal of this research program is to test a disruptive concept that ROS activation of the multifunctional calcium and calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) by isoform and organelle selective pathways determine physiological and pathological outcomes of ROS signaling. We discovered that oxidation activates CaMKII (ox-CaMKII, Erickson Cell 2008) and established that ox-CaMKII?, the major CaMKII isoform in heart, causes heart failure and arrhythmias. Our newest studies extended these findings to show that ox-CaMKII? also contributes to asthma. In sharp contrast, our new preliminary data indicate that ox-CaMKII?, an isoform enriched in skeletal muscle, is beneficial and enhances endurance, insulin sensitivity, lean phenotype, PGC-1?, and expression or brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a myokine that improves exercise capacity and protects against myocardial injury. Our group discovered that CaMKII is present in mitochondria and that mitochondrial-targeted inhibition of CaMKII protects against common forms of myocardial injury associated with high ROS (Joiner Nature 2012). Here we propose to pursue new models of global (i.e. body-wide) mitochondrial CaMKII inhibition in flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and mice developed for the proposed OIA studies. Mitochondrial CaMKII inhibited flies have a prolonged lifespan and resistance to paraquat induced oxidant injury, while mice with global CaMKII inhibition have reduced mortality in sepsis and increased weight gain. We performed new phosphoproteomic and metabolic analyses that identified unanticipated mitochondrial CaMKII targets with central roles in metabolism and ROS production. Our preliminary computational modeling and experimental data suggest that physiological activation of mitochondrial CaMKII contributes to a beneficial metabolic fight or flight response that increases ATP; however, sustained and excessive mitochondrial CaMKII activity causes dilated cardiomyopathy due to loss of complex 1 and ATP deficiency. We and our collaborators will use state of the art computer modeling, imaging and metabolic studies, and generate a panel of mouse and Drosophila models using CRISPR/Cas9 to dissect contributions of CaMKII to specific targets relevant to heart failure, arrhythmias and to health. This research program requires an R35, or similar, mechanism because of its highly innovative concept that challenges current paradigms in CaMKII and ROS biology, the need to manage large amounts of data and generate new animals models, and the requirement for a prolonged timeframe."
"9390842","CORE-004: CLINICAL TREATMENT UNIT AND CLINICAL TRIALS PROCESSING LABORATORY (CTU/CTPL SR) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The mission of the OSUCCC Clinical Treatment Unit and Clinical Trials Processing Laboratory Shared Resource (CTU/CTPL SR) is to advance the quality and efficiency of early phase clinical translational research. The CTU/CTPL SR, directed by Dr. Larry Schaaf, is composed of two different units that are intimately related: the Clinical Treatment Unit (CTU) and the Clinical Trials Processing Laboratory (CTPL). The CTU/CTPL was established in 2004 to support and expand our ability to conduct early phase trials (CTU) and the supports the processing of biospecimens for any CTO-managed trial (CTPL). It has particular expertise for, and is strategically located, supporting the OSUCCC clinical trials, especially early phase trials; 42% of the CTPL activities are for early phase trials conducted in the CTU. The CTU/CTPL was formally reviewed as a new shared resource in 2009, where funding was only requested for the CTPL. (The OSUCCC funded the CTU from institutional support, and will continue to do so). The CTPL enhances the quality of research by providing dedicated staff for high volume procurement, processing, storage, delivery, and shipment of research biospecimens critical to the correlative studies component of OSUCCC clinical trials. Highly trained staff in the CTU/CTPL SR work closely with the Clinical Trials Office (CTO) and other shared resources to provide protocol review and feasibility assessment, specimen kit assembly and distribution of specimens to internal and external research laboratories. The Specific Aims of the CTU/CTPL are: 1) to provide a stable, reliable, and cost-effective, state-of-the art unit for conducting early phase clinical trials requiring intense monitoring and/or complex correlative specimen collection; and, 2) to provide high quality, high volume specimen processing, short-term storage and distribution of biospecimens collected as correlative components of phase I, II and III translational clinical trials. During this previous grant cycle, the CTU has supported 142 protocols involving 1,354 patients with 14,490 patient visits, and the CTPL has procured and processed 82,454 research specimens on 381 protocols. During the past year, the CTU has supported 71 protocols involving 363 patients with 2,995 patient visits and the CTPL has procured and/or processed 17,875 research specimens on 216 protocols. During this time, 45 OSUCCC members, representing all five OSUCCC research programs, and accounting for 72% of the overall CTU/CTPL SR usage, have utilized the CTU/CTPL SR. The remainder of the usage was by clinical oncology faculty who work under the direct supervision of OSUCCC members. The CTPL has contributed to over 79 publications over the last five year grant period (16 with an impact factor > 10). The CTPL will continue to enhance the quality of clinical translational research conducted at the OSUCCC by providing improved efficiency, enhanced compliance, and cost-effective centralized support of early phase correlative studies.

"9469822","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled One Million Genomes: From Discovery to Health, organized by Drs. Geoffrey S. Ginsburg, Teri Manolio and Patrick Boon Ooi Tan. The conference will be held June 4 -8, 2018 at the Herrenhausen Palace in Hannover, Germany. The completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 has catalyzed innovations in scientific research and in health care embodied in the term ?precision medicine.? Across the globe, many nations are investing in large- scale national sequencing cohort programs, resulting in over one million human genomes sequenced and linked to dense phenotypic and clinical data. This Keystone Symposia conference will bring together scientists and leaders from healthcare and industry to discuss how to maximize the value of that investment for human health. It will assemble a unique and highly interdisciplinary international community to articulate how best to use these data-rich resources to provide novel insights into the biology of disease, tools for the management of patients and population health management strategies. The meeting will highlight challenges and potential solutions for germ-line and somatic sequencing programs and make recommendations for optimizing their impact on global health. The crucial role of free and open sharing and exchange of human variation data from these programs in allowing all of them to interpret novel variants and use them in clinical care will be emphasized. The meeting will focus on various scientific challenges for the field, including implementation science, the scalable data infrastructures and analyses required for impact on discovery and clinical care, and the value proposition for the investments that have been made in national programs. The leading edge of clinical impact of clinical sequencing with will be highlighted in sessions on pharmacogenomics, and on developing novel therapeutics."
"9440324","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Approximately 9% of the United States population have chronic kidney disease, although, this prevalence is even higher in Veterans given the high prevalence of diabetes and hypertension (underlying causes of CKD) in this patient population. Out of this staggering number, approximately 450,000 patients have end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring maintenance dialysis. The number of patients with ESRD is expected to increase to 700,000 by 2020. Five year survival for patients on dialysis is about 35%, a rate worse than many cancers. Half of these deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, investigations aimed at discovering novel pathways/molecules that can identify patients at high risk for CVD are of vital importance. Furthermore, these pathways can be explored to identify potential targets for therapy. Given the critical role HDL plays in prevention and reversal of CVD, studies aimed at evaluating and improving HDL function in ESRD patients are of considerable clinical and therapeutic value."
"9390848","CORE-010: MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY SHARED RESOURCE (MCSR) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The Medicinal Chemistry Shared Resource (MCSR) is critical to the OSUCCC drug development mission supporting preclinical studies leading to more rationale clinical trial designs and effective cancer therapies. Established during the last grant application as a developing shared resource, the MCSR is now being proposed as a formal shared resource. The MCSR's Senior Faculty Advisor is Dr. Ching-Shih Chen, a highly accomplished medicinal chemist, who established the MCSR as the director. The director of the MCSR is now Dr. Chad Bennett, a recent recruit, who is an experienced medicinal and process chemist with industry experience. The MCSR has three Specific Aims: 1) to custom-synthesize new agents to improve cancer therapeutics; 2) to synthesize agents for cancer researchers needing compounds that are not available; and, 3) lead optimization by conducting structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses and structure-based design. To accomplish these aims, the MCSR integrates the expertise of multiple disciplines, including medicinal chemistry, process chemistry, computational chemistry, structural biology and molecular pharmacology. The MCSR is located in the 4th floor of Biomedical Research Tower, in close proximity to most OSUCCC investigators. Since 2011, when the MCSR was established, the MCSR has provided chemical synthesis services to 32 OSUCCC investigators, 9 investigators from other NCI-sponsored institutions, and has synthesized 33 compounds that were otherwise not available from commercial sources or were cost prohibitive. These agents have helped investigators to conduct proof-of-concept in vitro and/or in vivo preclinical experiments that have aided in a better understanding of cancer biology and led to rationale clinical trial development. The MCSR has contributed to 63 publications over the last grant period, 6 of which were in journals with an impact factor >10, and it has supported 6 NCI grants (not including services provided for 9 other NCI Cancer Centers). The future plans are to build a formal partnership with the OSUCCC's Drug Development Institute and to increase services for lead optimization. The MCSR leverages extensive institutional support, and seeks only 15.4% support from CCSG funds. The Medicinal Chemistry Shared Resource is part of the Analytics Grouping."
"9432058","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) affects almost a quarter million patients annually, and is responsible for 3.6 million hospital days. ARDS has a mortality rate approaching 40%, and its primary causes are pneumonia and sepsis. Central to the pathophysiology of this lung injury is a sustained inflammatory response, which leads to mitochondrial damage, alveolar epithelia injury, and contributes to the formation of edema and impairment of gas exchange across the alveolus. Clinical treatment for ARDS is largely supportive, and many interventions (e.g. T-cell receptor blockades, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, cytokine blocking antibodies or corticosteroids) have not improved outcomes in ARDS. Thus, there is an unmet need for new therapies to reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with ARDS. Protein ubiquitination is the major protein processing pathways in cells by which ubiquitin (Ub) flags a targeted protein for degradation through the 26s proteasome or lysosome. It plays such a critical role in biological processes and its dysregulation leads to many diseases. Unfortunately, bacterial infection often disrupts the protein ubiquitination process. We and many other investigators have shown that infection or other inflammatory stimuli will alter the mRNA and protein levels of Ub E3 ligases, thus affecting the levels and functions of their target proteins. Thus, uncovering new Ub E3 ligase-based molecular pathways that contribute to lung injury provides unique opportunities to potentially devise new strategies to attenuate ARDS. We propose a systematic analysis of protein ubiquitination networks in ARDS, which has not been executed before. We have already identified several high value protein targets and laid out the experiment plans. These studies will add to the investigation into this exciting and critically important area of lung injury and inflammation. Specifically, we will focus on identifying novel molecular pathways that modulate the inflammatory cascade, mitochondria function/mitophagy, and DAMPs/inflammasome activation in the lung, and develop novel therapeutics for ARDS. In all three areas, we will systematically investigate how and which protein ubiquitination processes are dysregulated during lung injury. We will carry out state-of- the-art High-Throughput Screening (HTS) to identify the relevant E3 ligase/substrate pathways in the lung injury process. We will examine the process of protein ubiquitination using sophisticated biochemical tools, which will provide detailed mechanistic data such as substrate ubiquitination site and E3 ligase binding motif. Molecular and genetic approaches (such as Crispr/Cas9 gene editing and in vivo gene transfer) will be used to study the functions of E3 ligase/substrate in lung injury. We will also use our drug discovery expertise to develop small molecules for use in preclinical lung injury models. This proposal will lay the groundwork for futures studies involving the discovery of small molecules targeting protein ubiquitination pathways in ARDS."
"9455427","ABSTRACT Introduction. The HIV epidemic in the United States persists. Public health departments across the country are exploring how to better use viral genetic sequence data to reconstruct transmission networks and guide prevention efforts. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and University of California, San Diego (UCSD) unveiled a nationwide initiative, Secure HIV-TRACE, to allow public health departments to construct genetic transmission networks in near-real time. Concurrently, the New York City (NYC) Public Health Labs (PHL) began sequencing viral genotypes themselves (i.e., point-of-diagnosis genotyping) for people diagnosed by select providers, in order to reduce the time between diagnosis and sequence analysis. The goal of this these programs are to direct standard pubic health resources in near real-time to cases, clusters, and locations of greatest concern (i.e., greatest potential for future cases). The underlying assumption of this strategy is that prioritization based on cluster growth dynamics inferred from genetic sequence data will disproportionately reduce future disease burden. Therefore, the important question is not whether real-time time targeting can prevent incident infections; rather, the important question is: Can real-time targeting prevent more incident infections than current, network-agnostic public health strategies? Methods. Here, we propose an observational study designed to evaluate the impact of these real-time strategies, which are currently implemented in NYC. We will automate Secure HIV-TRACE to construct genetic transmission clusters in real- time to guide standard public health services in NYC. Using these clusters, we will identify Index Cases (i.e., HIV-infected people diagnosed by select provides who receive point-of-diagnosis genotyping by PHL) and then to identify Priority Partners (i.e., in-care viremic or out-of-care HIV-infected partners, genetically linked to the Index Case). Standard public health services will then be offered to these Priority Partners [e.g., return to care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence support, partner elicitation services]. Using data routinely reported to NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, we will assess whether these services provided to Priority Partners lead to (i) increased rates of viral suppression in the Priority Partners, (ii) less than predicted incident HIV cases in their transmission cluster, (iii) an interaction with past cluster growth to result in even less than predicted incident HIV cases in their transmission cluster, and (iv) an interaction with past cluster growth to identify more than predicted prevalent, undiagnosed HIV cases in their transmission cluster. Conclusions. If we observe an interaction between past cluster growth and public health outcomes resulting from standard prevention services, this will suggest that real-time network based prevention should become standard of care in NYC and beyond. Through Secure HIV-TRACE, we can expand this scope approach nationwide."
"9412905","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a largely incurable disease, with a 5 year survival rate of less than 10%. Effective targeted therapies to complement already maximal radiation and chemotherapy are urgently needed. Converging evidence shows that the EphA2 receptor is an attractive target for GBM. The PI's lab and others recently uncovered dual roles of EphA2 in tumor etiology and malignant progression. When engaged with ligands (ephrin-As), EphA2 is a tumor suppressor and inhibits both ERK and Akt activities in GBM cells. However, in the absence of ligands, EphA2 is phosphorylated by AGC kinases including Akt and p90-RSK on serine 897, and S897 phosphorylation converts EphA2 from a tumor suppressor into an oncogenic protein that promotes glioma cell migration in vitro and intracranial invasion of glioma stem cells (GSC) in vivo. Moreover level of pS897-EphA2 is correlated with tumor grades. Mechanistically pS897- EphA2 regulates the stem properties of GSCs and promotes gliomagenesis in the absence of ligands. In contrast, upon ligand stimulation, EphA2 induces GSC differentiation and inhibits tumor development. Based on this series of observations, we propose that ligand-mimicking small molecule agonists of EphA2 can be novel therapeutic agents for GBM. Such agonists are expected to i) restore the intrinsic tumor suppressor functions of EphA2, ii) disrupt the pro- oncogenic Akt/RSK-EphA2 signaling axis, and iii) induce differentiation of GSCs. Using structure- guided virtual screening and cell-based assays, we reported that doxazosin (DZ), an ?1- adrenoceptor antagonist still in clinical use for hypertension, is a bona fide EphA2 agonist. DZ inhibits ERK and Akt and suppresses tumor cell dissemination in an EphA2-dependent manner. Much more potent derivatives of DZ have been characterized through medicinal chemistry, including BW27, which suppressed GBM in preclinical models and was capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The overarching goal of this proposal is to translate these basic and preclinical discoveries into nove GBM therapeutic agents. BW27 will be subject to systemic preclinical test across all four molecular subtypes of human GBM. The on-target effects of BW27 will be investigated using the genetically engineered mouse model. Finally the X-ray co-crystal structure of EphA2 in complex with BW27 will be determined to guide the design of next generation(s) of EphA2 agonists. Completion of the studies could lead to new mechanism-based small molecule drug(s) for therapeutic intervention of GBM."
"9516356","Exosomes are secreted in the extracellular microenvironment by most cell types. Exosomes are enriched in proteins, lipids, mRNA, and microRNA molecules, and can act on local and distant recipient cells to mediate intercellular communication. Exosomes are implicated in the progression of a variety of diseases. In the context of infection, they have been shown to activate or inhibit the immune system, depending on the pathogen. As such, exosomes are promising for vaccination and diagnostic purposes because they are produced naturally, can be detected in and purified from bodily fluids, and their contents are disease specific and functionally active in recipient cell types. Despite their increasingly recognized involvement in mediating cell-cell communication and regulation of infection, existing techniques limit our ability to study the physiological interactions and the subsequent effects of exosomes both in vitro and in vivo. We propose to integrate the strengths of microscale technologies to develop a unique physiologically relevant lab-on-a-chip platform to enable real-time monitoring of the exosome activity during Yersinia pestis (Yp) infection. Yp is a highly infectious plague pathogen for which an FDA- approved vaccine or highly effective therapy is not available. While certain aspects of Yp virulence have been well characterized, making it an ideal model to study Gram-negative infections, the role of exosomes in infection progression of Yp remains to be elucidated. Consequently, Yp is a suitable candidate for our proposed work and the knowledge gained will provide an important foundation for studying the role of exosomes during other Gram-negative infections. Our results have demonstrated that treatment of monocytes with exosomes released by Yp-infected cells (EXi) enables them to clear out the Yp bacteria at a significantly higher rate. We have also shown that EXi induce changes in cell cycle and differentiation state of bystander nave (uninfected) monocytic cells, and also induce them to secrete specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that under physiological conditions EXi mediate immune responses in recipient cells, including cytokine release and immune cell migration (such as neutrophils) to the site of infection. As current knowledge about exosomes is based on in vitro assays with limited physiological relevance or hard to monitor in vivo studies, the proposed microfluidic approach will allow us to visualize and monitor exosomal transfer and also the EXi effects on recipient monocytes, including regulation of their cell cycle dynamics, and their stimulation to release pro-inflammatory cytokines that can in turn induce neutrophil migration towards the infection site."
"9390850","CORE-011: NUTRIENT AND PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYTICS SHARED RESOURCE (NPASR) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Diet, nutrition and lifestyle contribute significantly to the etiology of cancer and may play a role in cancer prevention, enhancing efficacy of cancer therapy and promoting survivorship. The rapid growth in funded cancer studies of dietary and nutritional components over recent years led to the proposal of a developing Nutrient and Phytochemical Analytic Shared Resource (NPASR) at the last review. Originally supported by CCSG Developmental Funds, this service is now being proposed as an established CCSG Shared Resource to provide OSUCCC members with expert bioanalytical method development and quantitative analysis of foods and biospecimens. The NPASR is located in the College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAES). The director (Dr. Schwartz (MCC)) and research scientist (Dr. Riedl) established the initial core services. The capabilities of the NPASR have been enhanced in recent years through substantial OSUCCC support for both salary and equipment, especially the recent purchase of Agilent 1290 UHPLC-Q-TOF 6550. Protocols are developed consistent with Good Laboratory Practices. Major services for the NPASR include: analytical method development and validation; nutrient and phytochemical analysis of foods; targeted metabolomics and biomarker analysis in cell cultures, experimental animals and humans; and, untargeted metabolomics. The Specific Aims of NPASR are to: 1) provide expert, leading-edge bioanalytical method development and quantitative analysis of nutrients and bioactive phytochemicals in foodstuffs and carcinogen exposures; 2) conduct targeted quantitative analysis of nutrients, bioactive phytochemicals and their metabolites in biological samples generated from cell and animal experiments and human clinical trials using HPLC-MS/MS techniques; and, as a developing aim, 3) perform untargeted metabolomics experiments for cancer-related prevention studies. NPASR, since its inception in 2010, NPASR has supported 12 OSUCCC members from 3 of the 5 OSUCCC programs (60% of the usage), all focused on cancer prevention. These OSUCCC members are from the Colleges of Medicine, Public Health, Pharmacy, Education and Human Ecology, and Arts & Sciences. NPASR has provided services for 45 cancer related publications and has supported projects for 12 NCI-funded grants, including four programmatic grants. What is unique about NPASR is that it couples high quality analytical services with experts who understand food composition, metabolism, and dietary interventions as applied to cancer prevention research. Along with developing the capability for several large funded projects, future growth areas include untargeted metabolomics, microbiome studies and studies of lipidomics and eicosanoid profiling. The NPASR leverages extensive institutional support and seeks 21.2% support from CCSG funds. The Nutrient and Phytochemical Shared Resource is part of the Analytics Grouping."
"9446136","Project Summary/Abstract The proposed investigation will examine ways in which the human metabolome predicts risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and also examine relationships between established dietary factors (in particular the Mediterranean dietary pattern), metabolites, and risk of T2D. High-throughput metabolite profiling (metabolomics) techniques have advanced to allow investigators to rapidly and robustly measure the full profile of thousands of small molecule metabolites circulating in human plasma. A subset of these currently known and unknown/novel metabolites are proximal in the pathophysiology of chronic diseases such as T2D, and some are modulated by a healthy diet. In this project, we propose to leverage rich resources available in three large-scale prospective US studies, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), the Nurses? Health Study (NHS), and the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL, ~20% African Americans), to evaluate relationships between circulating plasma metabolomic profiles, diet, and risk of T2D (1,800 incident events, 4,900 plasma samples). In Aim 1, we will examine baseline metabolites and metabolomic profiles associated with incident T2D in the HPFS and NHS (N=1,150 T2D matched case-control pairs identified through 2014) by analyzing both candidate and untargeted metabolites. In Aim 2, we will examine relationships between established dietary factors (e.g., Mediterranean diet score), metabolites, and T2D risk. Furthermore, in a subset of 500 study participants with 6-month repeated measures of diet and measured dietary biomarkers (e.g. total energy intake by doubly-labeled water, protein intake by urinary nitrogen, urinary sodium and potassium, and plasma carotenoids and vitamins), we will examine associations between specific dietary factors and metabolites. In Aim 3, we will replicate significant findings from Aims 1 and 2 in the VITAL study (N=650 T2D matched case- control pairs identified from 2011-2017), and conduct a meta-analysis of the three cohorts. In Aim 4, we will examine 10-year changes in the candidate metabolite levels of Aim 1 in relation to subsequent T2D (2000- 2014); these analyses will be performed in N=400 T2D matched case-control pairs from NHS with two blood samples collected 10 years apart. The highly cost-effective two-stage study design (i.e., discovery in HPFS/NHS and replication in VITAL) will reduce the chance of false positive findings and boost statistical power. This is the first study to evaluate long-term changes in plasma metabolite levels in relation to incident T2D. This novel approach mimics a ?natural experiment?, and the proposed analyses will facilitate causal interpretations. The findings could serve as critical first steps for evaluating both known and unknown/novel metabolites as targets for diet and lifestyle modifications for preventive or intervention strategies aimed at reducing the burden of T2D."
"9510636","The mucosa is a primary site for pathogen transmission, but injected vaccines induce poor mucosal immunity. Mucosal dendritic cell subsets in the buccal tissue can induce both immunity and tolerance to antigens. The proposed research focuses on inducing mucosal immunity by activating mucosal dendritic cells using recombinant outer membrane vesicles (rOMVs). Over the past decade, our research team has designed and developed rOMVs to induce robust Th1/Th2 immune responses to peptide antigens. In more recent and yet unpublished work, our team has discovered a way to activate and drive the maturation of DCs. Perhaps most exciting is that we quantified the penetration depth of rOMVs in the buccal mucosal tissue of the pig and show that the ~100 nm vesicles penetrate the tissue to depths consistent with the population of nave myeloid dendritic cells (>100 m). This rOMV-based technology, therefore, has a profile consistent with a mucosally-deliverable vaccine, specifically via buccal tissue. The objective of the research is to illustrate and establish the uniqueness of the rOMV approach as a method for buccal vaccine delivery. By combining the use of subunit epitopes with the tissue penetration of rOMVs, we will evaluate the hypothesis that the administration of these rOMVs to the buccal mucosa will induce the activation of nave DCs and induce a strong and balanced Th1/Th2 immune response. The hypothesis will be evaluated through the completion of the following Aims. Aim 1: to quantify the immune response to a ?weak? antigen to determine the efficacy and potency of the rOMVs. Our previous work used green fluorescent protein (GFP) as an effective model of a ?weak? antigen that demonstrated the potency of rOMVs administered subcutaneously. We will use the same approach to quantify both the humoral and cellular responses to GFP delivered by rOMVs to the buccal mucosa of pigs (the closest animal model to the human buccal mucosa). The results will be compared to the same formulation administered subcutaneously (i.e., benchmark) in order to correlate the efficacy of the buccal route of administration to a traditional route of administration. Aim 2: to quantify the immune response to the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen of influenza to determine the protective immunity conferred by the rOMVs. In previous work we used a sequence of HA delivered by subcutaneous injection of rOMVs in mice to quantify the level of protective immunity, as measured by the hemagglutinin inhibition assay and the antibody neutralization analysis. We will use the same approach to quantify both the humoral and cellular responses to HA delivered by rOMVs to the buccal mucosa of pigs. The results will be compared to the same formulation administered subcutaneously (i.e., benchmark) in order to correlate the efficacy of the buccal route of administration to a traditional route of administration. The Cornell- based research team of Putnam (rOMV vaccine design) and Chang (swine immunity) combines the labs of two experts who collectively have the skill to create an effective, buccally administered vaccine delivery platform that is potentially applicable to a wide range of mucosally-transmitted pathogens."
"9334590","Plastic bronchitis (PB), in which exudative cellular fibrin casts form in the airways, is a complex, rare, pediatric disease with high morbidity and mortality but for which there are no FDA-approved therapies. It most often oc- curs in children with congenital heart disease that have undergone surgical palliation with the Fontan proce- dure. Critically, in the absence of inhaled tPA treatment, the risk of PB-induced respiratory distress can be se- vere, often warranting urgent or emergent bronchoscopy for cast removal. In fact, PB is considered a life- threatening condition because mortality approaches 50%. As such there is a significant unmet need for safety and efficacy testing of inhaled tPA and for biomarkers of drug response. Here, we propose to fill this major gap in knowledge that hinders the advancement of this much needed therapy for these critically ill children by proposing a phase II clinical trial of inhaled tPA (IND119670; NCT02315898). The objective of this Clinical Study of Safety and Effectiveness of Orphan Products Research Project Grant (R01) application is to test the safety and effectiveness of the designated orphan drug, inhaled tPA (#14-4314), for the treatment of acute exacerbations of PB. To achieve this goal, we will address three specific aims: 1) To test the safety of an inhaled tPA regimen for the treatment of acute exacerbations of PB. To accomplish this aim we will count bleeding events and monitor parameters of bleeding such as hematocrit, international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PTT), and urinalysis of children with fibrin confirmed PB who receive an inhaled tPA regimen of 5mg every 6h for up to 96 h; 2) To assess the efficacy of an inhaled tPA regimen for the treatment of acute exacerbations of PB. To accomplish this aim we will monitor the frequency of airway cast production, cast size, pulmonary function tests and assess the need for bronchoscopy in children with fibrin confirmed PB who receive an inhaled tPA reg- imen of 5mg every 6h for up to 96h; 3) Metabolically characterize differences in children with and without PB and following inhaled tPA treatment. To accomplish this aim we will collect blood and urine samples from healthy, age-matched children, children with CHD, and children with PB for metabolomics assay. At the comple- tion of this clinical trial, it is our expectation that we will have: 1) knowledge of the safety of an inhaled tPA regi- men for the treatment of acute pediatric PB; 2) evidence of inhaled tPA treatment efficacy; and 3) a panel of me- tabolites linked to PB and inhaled tPA treatment response. Collectively, we expect these data will: 1) inform of the safe and 2) efficacious use of inhaled tPA in pediatric PB which will permit its confident use for PB treatment and allow us to optimally design a phase III clinical trial that will be needed for drug approval; and 3) direct a tar- geted metabolomics approach for the clinical monitoring of inhaled tPA drug response. These data will have a positive impact on the field of pediatric orphan drug development because they will support the approval of the only therapeutic for these patients and will advance understanding of the mechanisms that dictate the PB and tPA drug response phenotypes."
"9187026","Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this research program is to understand how to regenerate mammalian central visual pathways. This proposal specifically focuses on the question of how to regenerate projections from output neurons of the eye, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to their targets in the brain (collectively referred to `retinofugal pathway')- a circuit absolutely essential vision. Significant progress has recently been made in identifying molecular programs capable of triggering some RGC axon regeneration. The next crucial milestones for the field are to discover ways to increase the number RGC axons that regenerate and the distance they regro. It is also crucially important to determine whether regenerating RGCs can find and reconnect to the correct targets, such visual capacities return. The three major aims of this proposal are to: 1) test the hypothesis that specific forms of visual stimulation can enhance the number and distance of RGC regenerating axons 2) test the hypothesis that combining visual stimulation with molecular triggers of RGC axon growth can cause RGC axons to regrow long distances back into the brain and 3) determine whether regenerating RGCs are capable of pathfinding back to and re-connecting to their appropriate targets, as well as avoiding targets incorrect for their function. Results from these experiments should lead to new understanding of how mammalian visual circuits can be replenished in response to injury and pave the way for the cultivation of tools applicable to humans suffering from vision loss."
"9411141","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tranexamic acid (TXA), a drug that stops bleeding, is the only drug treatment that improves survival in adults with serious bleeding after injuries. However, TXA has not been used routinely in children with traumatic bleeding because no studies have appropriately evaluated TXA for injured children. Such a study has the potential for significant impact in improving the lives of injured children and their families, if found to be successful. Our long-term objective is to evaluate the benefits and risks of TXA in severely injured children. We will achieve this by ultimately conducting two large-scale, multicenter, randomized controlled trials of TXA use in severely injured children. One trial will evaluate TXA in children with severe injuries to the body (?torso injuries?, i.e., to the abdomen and chest) and the second trial will evaluate TXA in children with moderate-to- severe traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). However, conducting a clinical trial in critically ill children is challenging due to lower disease frequency and complex parent consent/child assent procedures. We therefore propose here to conduct a pilot study, designed similarly to the full-scale trials but with much smaller patient enrollment, to assess the feasibility of, and fill crucial information gaps for the two subsequent large-scale clinical trials. We will randomize injured children to one of three study arms: two different TXA doses or placebo. The specific aim of the proposed pilot study is to demonstrate the ability to efficiently identify and enroll children with hemorrhagic torso injuries or TBIs into a multicenter, randomized controlled pilot study evaluating these two doses of TXA and placebo. We will enroll 40 children who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria at 4 participating sites. To demonstrate the ability to collect outcome measures, we will collect the identical anticipated outcome measures for the subsequent clinical trials: total blood products transfused over the initial 48 hours of care (torso injury trial), and intracranial hemorrhage progression in first 24 hours and neurocognitive function at 6 months after randomization (TBI trial). We will also collect safety outcomes, specifically venothromboembolic events (i.e., blot clots in the blood vessels) and seizures within the initial 24 hours of study drug. Additional objectives of this pilot study are to: evaluate the ability to efficiently screen, identify, consent, randomize, and initiate the study intervention within 3 hours of injury, assess protocol adherence and variability of care in enrolled patients, and identify operational efficiencies with the potential to enhance the success of the subsequent trials."
"9412182","Abstract Pneumonia biology should be the focus of an R35 from the NHLBI. Pneumonia is a leading global burden of disease in every analysis. It kills more children worldwide and hospitalizes more US children than does any other disease. Older adults are even more affected. The incidence and risk of death from pneumonia increase throughout adulthood until becoming orders of magnitude greater than for young children. But the idea that adults have to be old and frail to get pneumonia is a counter-productive misconception. Pneumonia susceptibility is pronounced in middle age, with the median age of non-immunocompromised US adults hospitalized for pneumonia being 57 years. In addition to the directly attributable immediate morbidity and mortality, pneumonia also accelerates unhealthy aging, including exacerbations and more rapid decline of chronic pulmonary diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and more. A wide ranging assortment of viruses, bacteria, and other microbes causes pneumonia, with no one organism responsible for as much as a tenth of cases. It is not about the microbe. These are pathobionts, not pathogens. They circulate among us repeatedly or live on us continuously, growing in the lung to cause pneumonia only under exceptional circumstances. Whether pneumonia ensues depends on the quality and quantity of the host response. Pneumonia results from failures of lung defense more than from microbial virulence. We need to understand the lung defenses that normally prevent pneumonia in young healthy adults before we can identify, prevent, or reverse what goes wrong to make individuals susceptible to pneumonia. Our ongoing research program is addressing the question of lung defense against pneumonia with a long-standing and continuing focus on pulmonary inflammation and innate immunity that is now coupled with a newer emphasis on naturally acquired heterotypic adaptive immunity against respiratory pathobionts. This research program includes 2 ongoing NHLBI R01s that are defining roles of lung epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages in mediating protection against pneumonia. These 2 grants together total 26 R01-years of support from the NHLBI, and we propose unifying these distinct components of our mature and productive research program into a more integrated R35 award. During the coming years, we envision our research program (i) advancing mechanistic understanding of lung defense against pneumonia by functionally integrating the activities of lung constituents and adaptive immunity, (ii) leveraging discoveries in lung defense to generate new approaches to preventing and curing pneumonia, and (iii) forwarding the concept that pneumonia susceptibility is a chronic disease of aging, and attacking the mechanisms of susceptibility rather than (or in addition to) the acute infection has the greatest promise for diminishing the burden of this lung disease."
"9599006","Project Summary / Abstract    The primary goal of this Pathway to Independence proposal is to gain a full understanding of the roles of IL-12  and IL-23 signaling in human mycobacterial immunity. Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease  (MSMD) is a genetic condition predisposing children to severe disease upon infection by weakly virulent  mycobacteria, including the BCG vaccine. Although MSMD is rare, the study of this disease has the power to  elucidate the basic immunological mechanisms of immunity to the more virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In  the proposed research program, I will use knowledge gleaned from ?natural experiments?, that is, inborn errors  of mycobacterial immunity, to further our general understanding of mycobacterial pathogenesis. In particular, I  will functionally characterize novel bi-allelic mutations I have recently discovered in IL12RB2 and IL23R, genes  encoding the receptor chains that may pair with IL-12R?1 and are required for cellular responses to IL-12 and  IL-23, respectively (Aim 1). These mutations are present in 2 kindreds with multiple MSMD-affected children.  The receptors for IL-12 and IL-23 are considered components of either the canonical Th1 or Th17 T cell  pathways, and are known to play critical roles in IFN-? production, IL-17 production, or both. Therefore, I will  carry out detailed mechanistic studies to understand the differential impacts of these novel monogenic lesions  on the development and function of Th1 and Th17 cells (Aim 2). Finally, I will test the hypothesis that defects in  IL-12 or IL-23 signaling cause MSMD in these patients, and seek to identify additional monogenic causes of  MSMD in immunologically related genes in amongst >500 other MSMD patients (Aim 3). In the mentored K99  phase of the award, I will benefit from the unique learning environment and clinical resources of Dr. Jean-Laurent  Casanova?s laboratory at the Rockefeller University (RU). Dr. Casanova?s lab is the world leader in monogenic  dissection of infectious diseases, and interrogating susceptibility to mycobacteria is the lab?s longest-running  project. While working in Dr. Casanova?s lab, I will enjoy unparalleled access to physicians and patients around  the world, and the close counsel of many experienced colleagues. I will also gain experience with cutting-edge  techniques including whole exome and whole genome sequencing, RNAseq, imaging flow cytometry, and  multiplex cytokine arrays. A critical part of my career development plan is the scientific collaboration and career  development advice offered by my Advisory Committee, consisting of Dr. Casanova, Dr. Luigi Notarangelo  (NIAID/NIH), and Dr. Stuart Tangye (Garvan Institute, Australia), all of whom have pledged to support me in my  proposed research and in the development of my independent career. In all, the proposed plan will fulfill my  short-term scientific goal of elaborating the single-gene lesions responsible for mycobacterial susceptibility in  children, and my long-term goal of attaining an independent role investigating the host genetic determinants of  immunity to pathogens."
"9209206","UCLA Neurosurgery Research Education Program SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The fundamental goal of the UCLA Neurosurgery Research Education Program is to train neurosurgery residents in basic, translational, or clinical science research through direct investigative study, oral/written scientific presentation, and intensive mentored career development. The structure of the training program incorporates two tiers of mentoring, with a culmination in the production of career development grant application (K-award) in the final year of the residency for each trainee. This training program is supported by an excellent institutional environment for neuroscience research and education in the UCLA Departments of Neurosurgery, Neuropathology, and Neuroradiology, as well as newly formed UCLA Neuroscience Theme Area. We have had long-standing, strong collaborations with faculty members within the Department of Neurology?s research education program. The UCLA Department of Neurosurgery has consistently been in the top 5 NIH-funded neurosurgery departments in the nation, and has a significant depth and breadth of clinical, translational, and basic research faculty with diverse and well-funded subspecialty programs. The residency program has a strong track record of training many academic neurosurgeons over the past 25 years. Our Neurosurgery Research Education Program leverages our past educational experiences and the strong Neuroscience community at UCLA in order to provide a distinct research training track specifically for neurosurgery residents and fellows who are inclined to pursue academic careers as independent researchers, with the overall long-term goal to ensure that highly trained neurosurgeon-scientists will be available to make future advances that will lead to a reduction in the burden of neurological diseases."
"9508839","Project Summary Nearly 600 fungal species are capable of causing human infections, affecting ~300 million people worldwide. Though most fungal infections are non-life threatening, mortality rates from several species can exceed 50%. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most prominent opportunistic fungal pathogen and is responsible for the deaths of ~100,000 people annually. Over the last several decades, a tremendous collection of work has been devoted to uncovering the mechanisms, molecules, and genes involved in A. fumigatus pathogenicity. Despite these efforts, treating and controlling A. fumigatus infections is more challenging than ever, largely due to the emergence of drug resistance and the increased usage of immunosuppressive treatments. New resources, tools, and approaches are needed to decipher the genes and polymorphisms underlying the complex nature of A. fumigatus pathogenicity. To date, A. fumigatus genomic research has lagged behind the pace at which DNA-sequencing technologies and computational biology methodologies have advanced. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a community resource of A. fumigatus isolates and their associated genetic variant data in an effort to facilitate quantitative genetic and population genomic research. In Aim 1, we will create a publicly available collection of 230 genetically and phenotypically diverse A. fumigatus isolates that will be used as a reference panel for trait measurements. In Aim 2, we will sequence the genomes of each isolate and comprehensively catalogue genetic variation for use in A. fumigatus association mapping. In Aim 3, we will conduct a proof-of- concept genome-wide association analysis of virulence in the well-established wax moth larvae model system of invasive aspergillosis. At the conclusion of these studies we will have (i) created an invaluable tool that will allow for rapid, economical, and reliable association mapping of pathogenicity-associated traits, (ii) applied novel approaches to address and expand our knowledge of the genetic basis of A. fumigatus pathogenicity, and (iii) identified novel candidate genes to functionally examine in future studies. The results of this proposal have the potential to positively impact the hundreds of thousands of people burdened by A. fumigatus infection."
