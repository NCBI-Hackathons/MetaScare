"9416912","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Candidate: From my residency training in Pediatrics, through fellowship in Allergy and Immunology, to my current position as an Assistant Professor at the University of Utah, I worked towards the overarching goal of improving diagnosis and treatment by understanding the genetic and pathophysiologic basis of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). I am committed to an academic career as a physician scientist, elucidating disease mechanisms and translating discoveries in genetics to improving the care of patients with PIDs. I have demonstrated this commitment based on my development of outstanding mentorship at my institution, and have generated two first-authored, high-impact research articles involving the genetic investigation of a form of common variable immunodeficiency, and a population genetic analysis of RAG mutations associated with PIDs. Further, I have developed collaborations with key investigators within and outside of the University to maximize both relevant patient samples and efforts involving functional and genetic analyses of PIDs. Institutional Environment: I work in the laboratories of both Lynn Jorde, PhD, (Department of Human Genetics) and Guy Zimmerman, MD, (Molecular Medicine Program) and both laboratories are situated within the Eccles Institute of Human Genetics building located on the University of Utah Health Sciences campus. The University of Utah is an institution rich with resources to support physician scientists and includes the Health Sciences Center, which includes both a network of patient clinics and an adult hospital at the School of Medicine; a pediatric tertiary hospital; and support for researchers including vast core facility resources and the University of Utah Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS). My research environment is ideal for support of my research project and training aims. The Department of Pediatrics has demonstrated a commitment to support my career goals by providing intensive mentoring and training through the departmental Pediatric Clinical and Translational (PCAT) Research Scholars Program as well as being selected as a scholar in the K12 Child Health Research Career Development Award Program. Career Development and Training: My short-term career objective is to gain an understanding of the genetic and molecular pathogenesis of CVID caused by defects in the noncanonical NF-?B pathway. My longterm career objective includes development into an R01-funded, independent principle investigator who is able    to lead multiple projects in translational investigations of CVID and other PIDs. I crafted my career    development activities together with an outstanding mentorship team with two primary co-mentors and three advisors to build on my past research experiences and to address new skill development. My scientific training includes development of laboratory bench skills in functional immune assays utilizing human cells, development of my technical skills and understanding of bioinformatics in next-generation sequencing modalities, as well as development of clinical diagnostics for improved immunophenotyping of PID patients. My professional development and training includes continued development of my leadership skills to improve my ability to manage an independent laboratory, as well as continued development of collaborative relationships in the national and international PID community. The training plan includes regular meetings with my co-mentors, didactic courses, seminars, and national/international meetings. Project Description: We recently identified NFKB2 (NF-?B2), and its signaling pathway, the noncanonical NF-?B pathway, as the etiology of a form of CVID. Our preliminary data have demonstrated that the NFKB2 mutations in our CVID cohort result in reduced NF-?B2/p52 nuclear translocation. The resultant phenotype includes early age-onset of panhypogammaglobulinemia, autoimmune features and adrenal insufficiency. Little is known about the direct downstream signaling and transcriptional effects of NF-?B2 in humans, and why mutations in NFKB2 may result in the specific CVID phenotype. We aim to delineate the effects of NFKB2 mutations at the transcriptional, molecular, and cellular levels to better understand the contribution of the noncanonical NF-?B pathway in maintaining humoral immunity. First, we will perform functional B cell assays to identify defects contributing to poor antibody production. Second, we will perform RNA-Seq to determine differences in gene expression caused by mutant NFKB2, in order to identify the targets that have protein level changes. Using RNA-Seq, we will identify the major signaling pathways regulated by NF-?B2 and confirm alterations at the protein level. Finally, we will perform exome sequencing followed by state-of-the-art bioinformatic analysis to investigate pathways regulated by NF-?B2, identify and phenotype additional CVID patients with noncanonical NF-?B defects, and discover new disease-causing variants. The research proposed here will allow me to combine my clinical skills with thorough training in cutting-edge genomic and molecular analysis. It will position me at the forefront of the genetic revolution."
"9553958","Bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by Gram-negative bacterial pathogens are associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to the antibiotic-resistant nature of the pathogens. Infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens result in substantial health and economic impact due to the lack of effective therapeutic options. This lack of treatment options is particularly relevant for MDR Gram-negative pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, which have shown a great propensity to challenge the clinical care of patients suffering from such infections. Arrevus is developing a novel approach to addressing Gram-negative MDR infections through the use of Designer Proline-rich Antimicrobial peptide Chaperone protein inhibitors (DPCs) derived from insects, which serve as inhibitors to one of the critical bacterial proteins responsible for bacterial protein folding, DnaK. As an adjuvant therapy to current antibiotics, DPCs have the potential to provide a much-improved treatment option for MDR Gram- negative bacterial infections. Preliminary studies have displayed the potential of ARV-1501, the lead DPC, as an antibiotic potentiating agent against MDR Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Our efforts have shown that: 1) ARV-1501 via an intramuscular route is effective against MDR A. baumannii in a bacteremia model; 2) ARV-1501 enhances the activity of colistin and imipenem; 3) ARV-1501 has a favorable preliminary safety profile; and 4) ARV-1501 enhances the effects of legacy antimicrobials through a novel mechanism of action. Collectively, these data support the continued development of AVR-1501 through a Fast-Track program that is geared toward characterizing the therapeutic potential and safety profile of ARV-1501 in order to construct a target product profile (TPP). This overall goal will be met through the execution of the following aims: Phase I Specific Aims are: 1) To define the spectrum of activity of ARV-1501. 2) To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous dosing of ARV-1501 for the treatment of Gram-negative BSIs. The measures of success to advance to Phase II are 1) Identification of an optimal antibiotic for use as a co-treatment with ARV-1501 against Gram-negative pathogens; and 2) Determination of the efficacy of ARV-1501 when delivered intravenously in a Gram-negative BSI mouse model. Phase II Specific Aims are: 1) To characterize the pharmacological properties and therapeutic activity of ARV-1501. 2) To obtain a preliminary safety profile of ARV-1501. The measure of success for Phase II is to complete key pharmacological and safety assessments to craft the TPP."
"9416830","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock plays a key role in coordinating many biological processes from behaviors to cellular metabolism and mitosis. Recent studies have linked disruption of circadian rhythms with increased breast cancer risk, suggesting women working alternative shifts may have a higher risk of breast cancer. Our recent results indicate that disruption of molecular timing negatively impacts several processes that determine the outcome of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolism, resulting in increased DNA damage. We have found that time of day, as well as individual circadian clock components, uniquely regulate processes governing benzo-a-pyrene (BaP) activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and estrogen receptor (ER) mediated endocrine disruptor (EDC) signaling in the mouse mammary gland and breast cancer cell lines. This new knowledge led us to hypothesize that the circadian clock influences BaP-mediated metabolism and DNA damage and repair, and that time of day, or disruption of the circadian clock, impacts the outcome of PAH exposure and EDC activity. To test this hypothesis we propose two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will define the circadian windows of susceptibility in mouse mammary tissues and MCF7 breast cancer cells by analyzing differences in BaP-induced AHR- and ER- signaling, formation and persistence of BaP-DNA adducts and DNA damage responses and the time course of BaP clearance using a novel multiphoton imaging approach to measure real time circadian-dependent differences in BaP metabolism in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will utilize a novel mammary gland transplant approach to discern for the first time in vivo central versus peripheral affects mediating circadia clock influences on acute BaP-induced toxicity and estrogen action in mammary tissues using circadian and AHR and ERa knockout mouse models and binding of AHR and ER in vivo by ChIP-Seq analysis. The expected outcomes of this research will be identification of the key sites of action and metabolic pathways by which PAHs interact with circadian clocks in promoting DNA damage and breast cancer."
"9191389","Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest public health threats worldwide. The development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens is largely driven by inappropriate antimicrobial use. Current reports state that over 50% of antimicrobial use in hospitals and up to 70% in long-term care facilities is potentially inappropriate. Recognizing the urgency of this national crisis, President Obama issued an executive order in September 2014, mandating the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (AMS) nationally, and specifically noting that ?all VA healthcare settings, including long-term care facilities? will be involved. Unfortunately, this process of developing AMS in VA Community Living Centers has lagged behind those in acute-care facilities and little is known about the degree of antibiotic resistance and the types of stewardship interventions that might work in these facilities. Antimicrobial stewardship promotes the appropriate use of antimicrobials in order to improve patient safety and to decrease adverse events related to inappropriate antimicrobial use. Improving antimicrobial use in acute-care facilities is a critical focus of The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), as evidenced by the recent VHA Directive 1031. This policy charges every Veterans Affairs (VA) acute care facility to develop and implement an antimicrobial stewardship program led by champion physicians and pharmacists. This VHA Directive does not currently require the implentation of antimicrobial stewardship activities within nursing homes. In 2013, the VHA provided care to over 100,000 veterans in nursing homes. This proposal brings together a cadre of VA experts in the fields of long term care quality improvement, infectious diseases, geriatrics, and antibiotic stewardship (MDs, PharmDs, PhD) to directly address this timely area of study. In direct response to an HSRD priority area for research involving long term care, the overall goals of this 4 year mixed methods merit proposal are to determine the scope of antimicrobial resistance among VA CLCs, to compare that information with antimicrobial utilization patterns in CLCs and proximal VAMCs, and to develop effective antimicrobial stewardship strategies tailored for the long term care environment. We hypothesize that resistance patterns and antibiotic use for CLCs will vary significantly and will be different from those observed in proximal acute care facilities. Furthermore, we hypothesize that comprehensive interdisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship programs will have the capacity to reduce selection for drug-resistant pathogens for the CLC, minimize transmission of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among patients, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes provided that they are tailored to the unique barriers that long term care entails. The specific aims of this study are: 1) Measure antimicrobial use and resistance in VA-CLCs nationally through the development of a longitudinal database of antimicrobial use and resistance. This database would allow us to quantify regional and temporal trends, and identify areas of high antimicrobial use and resistance nationally, 2) Develop and implement various well researched antimicrobial stewardship practices and programs at three CLCs, 3) Measure Antimicrobial Stewardship interventions on resistance, antimicrobial use and outcomes data from pilot CLCs."
"9341389","Project Summary Complex diseases such as schizophrenia (SCZ) result from multifactorial genetic and environmental perturbations that cause pleiotropic changes in molecular networks, resulting in disease. The goal of our project is to move our CommonMind Consortium (CMC) data generation to the next level, focusing on cell-type specific data generation including transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and integrated analyses, from critical regions implicated in SCZ to improve our ability to identify and refine genetic risk factors for SCZ. We will characterize cell-type specific transcriptome and epigenome components in our post-mortem CMC SCZ and control cohort and in new control autopsy specimens. In 50 SCZ cases and 50 controls from the CMC, we will 1.) perform RNA, sequencing, 2.) ATACseq, and 3.) Hi-C in nuclei isolated from pools of glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, and oligodendrocytes isolated from the prefrontal cortex. In the same samples we characterize proteins of post-synaptic density proteins by liquid chromatography (LC)-selective reaction monitoring (SRM)-mass spectrometer (MS) quantitative proteomic analyses. In order to uncover how many distinct types of cells are present in various brain regions of control individuals we will use nanofluidics and bar-coding (Drop-seq) from freshly autopsied, never frozen or fixed control specimens. Integrative analyses will be pursued that will combine genetic, gene expression, epigenomic and proteomic data to identify novel SCZ genes. Finally, we will continue to maintain and upgrade our community workspace that provides for the rapid dissemination and open evaluation of data, analyses, and outcomes derived from the CMC. We will continue to make all data available to the research community through the Sage Bionetworks Synapse Platform. There is a deep need to more cell-type specific information on the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape in the human brain, and in particular in neurons and glia and to integrate this information with human SCZ genetics. We have assembled the critical key personnel, sample resources, technological know-how, and analytic strategies to be able to provide both useful maps for the field, as well as begin to unravel SCZ biology."
"9466514","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this proposal is to develop an efficient and robust method to epigenetically reprogram naïve human T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs) that can prevent graft versus host disease (GvHD). Our short term goal for Phase I of the STTR award is to demonstrate that we can epigenetically-reprogram naïve T cells using CRISPR/Cas9-based technology into immunosuppressive cells that have the protein marker, gene expression, and epigenetic regulatory profiles of Tregs. This will motivate Phase II of the STTR, where we will test the epigenetically-reprogrammed Tregs in a humanized mouse model of graft versus host disease. The data obtained during the STTR will position the therapy for clinical trials to prevent GvHD in hematopoietic cell transplantation. There is a clinical need to improve patient outcomes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) due to the high incidence, morbiditity, and mortality associated with GvHD. Approximately half of all HCTs utilize hematopoietic cells from unrelated donors, and approximately 26,800 patients will undergo this procedure per year worldwide. Despite improved diagnostics to match the most immunogenic antigens on the donor cells with those of the recipient, up to 70% of allogeneic HCT recipients will develop GvHD as a result of their graft. Only 50% of HCT recipients that develop GvHD survive 3 years beyond the transplant procedure. GvHD is mediated by donor T cells that recognize polymorphisms in the protein-coding genome of the graft and the recipient, and these reactive T cells can be suppressed by Tregs. We will utilize CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenetic editing tools to reprogram naïve human T cells, which be easily collected from whole blood by apheresis or density gradient centrifugation, into immunosuppressive Tregs. We will first perform a high-throughput screens of candidate Treg- specific gene regulatory elements that we have identified through computational analysis of epigenomic data. We will then validate that these elements can be activated by CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome modification tools that we have developed to generate T cells with the phenotype, in vitro suppressive properties, gene expression, and chromatin regulatory profile of Tregs. !"
"9511384","Abstract The recognition of posttranslational modifications by modular protein domains is a fundamental determinant of selectivity in signaling pathways. In particular tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation pathways are regulated by a large number of different, modular phosphotyrosine (pTyr) recognition domains such as SH2 and PTB domains that recognize pTyr and coordinate signaling events downstream of kinases. While in eukaryotes, several pTyr recognition domains have independently evolved and in humans, for example, there are more pTyr recognition domains than Tyr kinases, no pTyr recognition domains have been identified in bacteria. Yet, pTyr reader domains evolved repeatedly, are highly versatile, are highly integrated parts of phosphorylation pathways, and are nearly ubiquitous except in bacteria. Given the large networks of Tyr phosphorylation in bacteria, it appears likely that bacteria also evolved pTyr recognition domains that remain to be discovered. Here, we will test this idea by identifying pTyr-binding proteins in Mtb."
"9417078","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD) are the 15th most common cause of death in the U.S. They are frequently inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, with the defective gene products including smooth muscle contractile proteins (e.g., MYH11), extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and TGF-? signaling components; loss of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the aortic media characterizes the disease. We recently identified a single gain-of-function mutation (R177Q) in protein kinase G1 (PKG1) as the cause of TAAD in families with early dissections; the mutation causes constitutive, cGMP-independent enzyme activation. We generated mice carrying the R177Q knock-in mutation (PKG1RQ), which are normotensive and have no overt phenotype up to 4 months of age; however, pressure overload by trans-aortic constriction (TAC) caused excessive mortality with aortic rupture and abnormal aortic and cardiac remodeling. Determining how sustained PKG1 activation affects aortic integrity is of broader clinical relevance, because case reports suggest that repeated use of the PKG-stimulating drug sildenafil (Viagra) can lead to TAAD, and treating mice with a MYH11 mutation with sildenafil increased development of TAAD under hypertensive stress. We found increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tissue markers of oxidative damage, excess TGF-? signaling, and altered contractile and ECM-related gene expression in SMCs and aortas of PKG1RQ-mutant compared to wild type mice. We hypothesize that excess PKG1 activity leads to increased oxidative stress and dysregulation of gene expression in SMCs, resulting in impaired aortic wall maintenance/repair, and that reducing ROS production may protect PKG1RQ-mutant mice from aortic aneurysms. In Aim I, we will determine if hetero- and homozygous PKG1RQ mice develop aortic dilation and dissection spontaneously with age, or only under hypertensive stress, and examine the effect of pharmacological PKG activation on aortic wall integrity in wild type and heterozygous PKG1RQ mice. In Aim II, we will compare ROS production by mitochondria, NOX isoforms, and uncoupled NO synthases in wild type and PKG1RQ SMCs and tissues. To determine if excess ROS production is causally linked to aortic pathology, we will treat PKG1RQ mice with cobinamide, a vitamin B12 analog that is a novel ROS neutralizing agent, or cross them with NOX4-deficient mice and mice over- expressing mitochondrial superoxide dismutase or catalase. In Aim III, we will use RNA-seq and gene network analysis to compare a PKG1-induced gene signature in the aorta from wild type and PKG1RQ mice and from patients carrying the PKG1 mutation. We will analyze gene networks known to be involved in TAAD pathogenesis and determine ROS-induced transcriptome alterations. In Aim IV, we will determine the molecular basis of PKG1 activation by the R?Q mutation using deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry. Since PKG1 is the pharmacological target of multiple, clinically-used drugs, a better understanding of the effects of long-term PKG activation and excess ROS on aortic wall integrity is important. The potent ROS- neutralizing agent cobinamide is a promising new agent for anti-oxidant therapy in vascular diseases."
"9448570","Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent, poorly-managed, and disabling in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise training is a promising approach for managing cognitive dysfunction in MS; however, results from previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been equivocal. This is inconsistent with the well- established literature from the general population that consistently documents beneficial effects of exercise training on cognition and brain function. Indeed, the MS RCTs suffer from significant methodological flaws and are not on par with the rigor of exercise training studies on cognition in the general population. To that end, we recently completed a line of research that identified progressive (i.e., both intensity and duration) treadmill walking exercise as an optimal exercise training intervention for improving cognitive processing speed (CPS; the most commonly impaired cognitive domain in MS) and thalamocortical resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), in particular, among fully-ambulatory persons with MS. To that end, the purpose of the present proposal is to conduct an adequately-powered, single-blind, RCT, using an active control condition for improving CPS and brain function in cognitively-impaired persons with MS at a single research site. This study will examine the effects of 3-months of supervised, progressive chronic treadmill walking exercise (designed based on pilot work) compared with a placebo control condition (i.e., stretching- and-toning activities) on CPS, fMRI (i.e., thalamocortical RSFC), and functional outcomes in 88 persons with MS who present with slowed CPS. We will collect data on CPS, thalamocortical RSFC, and functional outcomes at baseline and follow-up (i.e., at the conclusion of the 3-month intervention period) time points. We hypothesize that treadmill walking exercise training will result in significant improvements in CPS, thalamocortical RSFC, and functional outcomes. We further speculate that improvements in thalamocortical RSFC might explain exercise-related improvements in CPS. If successful, the proposed study will provide the first Class I evidence for the effects of treadmill walking exercise training as a rehabilitative approach to improve CPS, its neural correlate, and functional consequences in persons with MS who need such an intervention the most. This line of research will lay the groundwork for the development of exercise training guidelines that can be adapted by clinicians for use by MS patients for specifically improving cognition and brain health. Such an evidence-based approach for rehabilitation, using exercise training, is paramount considering the prevalent, disabling, and poorly-managed nature of MS-related CPS impairment. This is consistent with the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research?s mission to foster development of scientific knowledge needed to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of persons with physical disabilities."
"9530984","ABSTRACT ? (Title: Dynamic Neural Mechanisms of Audiovisual Speech Perception) Natural speech perception is multisensory; when conversing with someone that we can see, our brains combine visual (V) information from face, postural and hand gestures with auditory (A) information from the voice. The underlying speech processing is extremely rapid, with incoming AV units (e.g., syllables) arriving every few hundred milliseconds that must be encoded and passed on before the next syllable arrives. Finally, this bottom-up sensory information is combined with a top-down cognitive component: what we perceive is strongly influenced by its context. Speech is fundamentally human, and thus, its brain mechanisms are usually studied with noninvasive fMRI, EEG and MEG. Because each method has critical limitations in spatial or temporal resolution, identifying the specific brain mechanisms of speech perception - AV integration, precise and rapid information encoding and top-down control - is a nearly intractable problem.  This three-year U01 project will sidestep the problem using direct recording of neuron ensemble (electrocorticographic or ECoG) activity and single neuron activity, along with direct stimulation of selected sites in the brains of surgical epilepsy patients as they process AV speech. Our collaborative ECoG team embodies expertise in multisensory integration and speech perception and leverages the skills and perspectives of neuroscientists, neurosurgeons, engineers, neuropsychologists, neurologists, and ethicists across three leading epilepsy centers: Columbia University Medical Center, Baylor College of Medicine and Northshore-Long Island Jewish Medical Center. By combining the expertise and patients available at all three centers, we will be able to tackle problems that are inaccessible to individual investigators.  Our overarching hypothesis, building on our past work and supported by preliminary data, is that fluctuations in the excitability of neurons?oscillations?play a key role in speech processing. Aim 1 tests the general hypothesis that delta/theta range (2-8 Hz) neuronal oscillations play a key role in the integration of auditory and visual speech information. Aim 2 tests the general hypothesis that high-frequency activity (50 Hz and above) encodes representations of auditory and visual speech information, reflecting both bottom-up and top-down influences on perception.  The concept employed in this proposal of oscillatory dynamics as mechanistic instruments (Aim 1) that organize the encoding of information in neuronal firing patterns under dynamic top-down control (Aim 2) are part of a paradigm shift in speech science. The broad goal of this proposal is to contribute key foundations for this new paradigm, and set the stage for a comprehensive understanding of the brain circuits and physiological processes underlying natural speech perception, including complex social settings."
"9411131","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major clinical and public health problem. AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, embolic events, heart failure exacerbation, and all-cause mortality. Most of the evidence on the consequences of AF has focused on patients with persistent AF. However, the most common type of AF in the US is paroxysmal AF (PAF) which is often asymptomatic and unlikely to be identified except in subjects undergoing continuous cardiac monitoring. Hence, the natural history and health consequences of PAF and its progression towards persistent AF remain incompletely understood. Recent efforts focusing on understanding the role of PAF in triggering strokes and other major adverse events have been inconclusive and current evidence is insufficient to quantify the risk of stroke and other major adverse events associated with PAF episodes due to limited follow-up and sample size.  To better understand the short- and long-term effects of PAF on the risk of death and other cardiovascular events, we will assemble a unique dataset of ~238,000 patients with dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) using remote monitoring implanted from 2006-2017 and with no persistent/permanent AF at the time of implant but who are at particularly high risk for PAF. This dataset represents the largest cohort of individuals with continuous monitoring of atrial arrhythmic events and is the result of an unprecedented combination of data from the three major ICD manufacturers (Medtronic, Boston Scientific, and St. Jude Medical), which collectively have 95% of the US ICD market. Reliable automated algorithms for detecting PAF episodes of duration >30 minutes are available in all dual-chamber ICDs which record time of onset, duration and heart rates. We will link PAF episode data with patient characteristics at the time of implant from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry and with hospitalization outcomes data from the Medicare utilization files and the National Death Index with up to 12 years of follow-up (~990,000 person-years of follow-up) through well-established linking methodologies using indirect data elements. The primary endpoint will be ischemic stroke (expected number of events ~4,700) and the secondary endpoints will be myocardial infarction (~8,600 events), other embolic events (~4,500 events), hospitalization for heart failure exacerbation (~20,500 events) and all-cause mortality (~96,700 events). We hypothesize that PAF episodes increase the short-term and the long-term risk of the primary and secondary endpoints and that faster rates of progression toward persistent AF are also associated with an increased risk of outcomes. The scope and size of this study will allow us to describe the consequences and progression of PAF and to quantitatively estimate, for the first time, the short- and long-term increase in risk associated with PAF episodes. These results will have important implications for clinical risk assessment and health policy."
"9447433","PROJECT SUMMARY. TP53 is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancer. However, about half of cancers retain a wild type version of the p53 protein, which is commonly attenuated by other mechanisms, such as overexpression of the repressor MDM2. The presence of wild type p53 opens a window of opportunity for therapeutic reactivation of this transcription factor. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that modify the p53 network in a cell type-specific manner, affecting cell fate choice and tumor suppression downstream of p53 reactivation. The ultimate goal is to enable effective p53-based targeted therapies. Using a comprehensive multi-omics experimental and analytical pipeline we identified three major regulatory mechanisms affecting p53 signaling in a cell type-specific fashion: chromatin architecture at target loci, secondary ?amplifying? transcription factors, and cell type-specific translational regulators. We will investigate each mechanism in detail by developing the following Specific Aims: 1. To define the impact of cellular transformation on the direct p53 program. We discovered that cell type-specific variations in the direct p53 transcriptional program are associated with distinct patterns of chromatin architecture, including differences in DNA methylation. We will now test the hypothesis that the direct p53 program is attenuated during tumor evolution via chromatin-based mechanisms that restrict the number of available direct p53 targets. We will do this by applying our multi-omics pipeline to study the direct p53 program in intestinal organoids derived from normal epithelium and colorectal carcinoma explants. 2. To define the role of secondary transcription factors in the p53 response. We identified two novel direct p53 target genes, the transcription factors ETV7 and POU2F2, which are predicted to elicit the indirect transcriptional program in cells where p53 has an intact tumor suppressive activity. We will define the role of ETV7 and POU2F2 in the observed amplification of p53 effects on the global transcriptome, as well as their contribution to p53-dependent cellular responses in vitro, and tumor suppressive activity in xenograft models. 3. To identify translational regulators controlling the cellular response to p53 activation. Translation of hundreds of mRNAs is activated or repressed downstream of p53 in a cell type-specific manner. We identified 3?UTR motifs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that are predicted to mediate cell type-specific translational control. We will continue to identify and characterize functional RNA motifs and interacting RBPs acting in different contexts, and define their contribution to p53-dependent cellular responses in vitro and to the ability of p53 to induce tumor regression in xenograft models. Upon completion, this proposal will significantly advance our understanding of regulatory mechanisms within the p53 network, and contribute to the future design of improved p53-based therapeutic strategies."
"9436227","Summary T lymphocytes use the T cell receptor (TCR) to recognize antigens in the form of peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). CD8 is a co-receptor that binds unliganded MHC with low affinity but TCR-liganded pMHC with 2-logs higher affinity. Some pMHCs behave as null pMHCs by themselves but as coagonist pMHCs when co-presented with agonist pMHCs by greatly enhancing TCR responses. While both phenomena have been reported, their mechanisms remain elusive due to the lack of tools to analyze multimeric interactions among multiple receptor-ligand species quantitatively. We propose to design and construct multi-DNA force probes to quantitatively study force generation and sensing by T cells. In particular, we will study how T cells exert differential forces via the TCR and CD8 on dual species of pMHCs that are clustered on the APC surface to promote multivalent binding. Using our expertise in DNA nanotechnology, we will create various DNA origami based tension probes that will report the TCR- and CD8-pMHC binding events in a quantitative fashion. The proposed experiments will be carried out in the following specific aims. (1) To develop multi-color DNA force probes for studying the cooperative effect of coagonist pMHC on agonist pMHC binding to TCR and CD8. Dual color DNA-force probes will be designed to report the binding of agonist and coagonist independently. Two sets of experiments will be performed using wild-type MHC that allows CD8 binding and/or mutant MHC that prevents CD8 binding to present agonist and/or coagonist peptides in different combinations. Our study will provide insights to how coagonist binding to CD8 affects agonist binding in terms of force generation and sensing by the T cell. (2) To develop DNA force probe arrays with controlled coagonist/agonist spatial organization for investigating the multivalent binding between TCR/CD8 and agonist/coagonist. We will create complex arrays of dual color probes to simulate the clustering effect. Origami- based DNA nanostructures with various inter-probe distances, ratios and densities will be used to investigate the clustering effect. Our study will shed light on the mechanism of T cell mechanosensing. T cell functions are governed by coordinated interactions of many receptors, including antigen receptor/coreceptor, adhesion receptors, cytokine receptors, and co-stimulatory/inhibitory receptors. The tools developed herein are applicable to study of other molecular interactions of T cells and other cells in the immune system or other biological systems, thereby potentially impacting the broader biomedicine field where cell surface molecular interactions are being targeted for treatment of various diseases, including autoimmunity, viral infection, and cancer. !"
"9555179","No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, ?it is difficult to diagnose a negative?. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy."
"9432343","ABSTRACT  Microsatellite Instability (MSI), the spontaneous loss or gain of nucleotides from repetitive DNA tracts, is a molecular phenotype in oncology that is associated with genomic hypermutability and mutations in DNA repair enzymes. Although originally described in colorectal tumors, MSI has lately been regarded with newfound importance for cancers in general, owing to the recent discoveries that MSI-affected tumors are susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, and that MSI is a generalized tumor phenotype found across virtually all cancer types. Despite its emerging importance as a powerful pan-cancer therapeutic marker, existing diagnostics for MSI are limited in throughput, sensitivity, specificity, quantitation, prognostic capabilities, and generality across tumor types, among other important features. There is consequently a need for clinical diagnostics with improved performance and enhanced diagnostic capabilities. We have recently developed a new experimental paradigm (smMIP capture) that can overcome these limitations. In our approach, each copy of a target sequence that is present in a sample is molecularly tagged during the first cycle of a multiplex capture reaction with a unique random sequence. After amplification, target amplicons and their corresponding molecular tags are subjected to massively parallel sequencing. During analysis, the molecular tags are used to associate sequence reads sharing a common origin. Through oversampling, reads bearing the same molecular tag error-correct one another to yield an independent haploid consensus for each progenitor molecule, effectively bypassing length-altering slippage mutations which occur at repetitive microsatellite tracts (?stutter? artifact) and enabling sensitive quantitation of even low prevalence microsatellite mutations. Among other benefits, the approach is scalable to large numbers of genomic targets and is sensitive to at least 1 variant in a background of 10,000 unmutated templates. Here we propose the advanced development and validation of smMIP capture as a clinical diagnostic for MSI. In our first Aim, we will develop a multiplexed panel to broadly target ~1,000 highly informative microsatellite loci, as well as protocols and analytic methods for its use and interpretation. In our second Aim, we will define clinical performance characteristics of the assay, and will validate it against existing, clinical standard-of-care MSI diagnostics. In our third Aim, we will apply the smMIP panel prospectively in a clinical trial cohort, and assess its potential impact on clinical care and correlation with patient outcomes compared to standard testing. This work will provide information and deliverables with direct, transformative benefit cancer to patients, by expanding the scope of MSI testing across tumor types, and by providing better stratification for immunotherapy treatment, prognostic estimation, and quantitative data on mutational burden that is biologically-meaningful for understanding patient outcomes and identifying MSI subtypes."
"9431216","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four neural structures in the Drosophila optic lobes (lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula complex) sequentially process visual information through neural networks of specialized cell types organized in a retinotopic manner. We will continue our investigations to understand how neuronal diversity is generated in the developing optic lobes, which are comprised of more than 100 cell types. Our observations suggest that neuronal specification in the medulla results from the integration of three mechanisms: (i) 800 neuroblasts express a sequence of temporal transcription factors to generate distinct types of neurons as they age, each contacting one of the 800 columns innervated by photoreceptors. (ii) The temporal series is modified locally by regional transcription factors and produces neurons that innervate multiple columns. (iii) Binary fate choice via Notch further diversifies daughters of the terminal cell division. In the posterior-most region of the developing medulla and in the progenitor region of the lobula complex, neurogenesis differs significantly with a different set of transcription factors that act not only to specify neuronal fate but also to control the precursor mode of division and the death or survival of neurons. This illustrates how complex brain structures use different strategies to adapt and produce the correct number of specific cell types with the appropriate characteristics. We will investigate the mechanisms controlling this neurogenesis. Aim 1: Temporal progression of neuroblasts: Timing and transition mechanisms Temporal patterning is a general mechanism to generate neural diversity in flies and vertebrates. We will explore the molecular processes controlling the temporal progression of neuroblasts in the medulla. Aim 2. Regionalization of the medulla neuroepithelium and specialization of neuroblasts We will investigate the rules that modify the output of the temporal series in different regions of the medulla progenitor domain. This allows the local production of neurons that migrate to occupy the entire medulla. Aim 3. Correlation between transcription factor expression and neuronal characteristics To understand how transcription networks control the characteristics of neurons, we will use large-scale single cell transcriptomics to identify regulatory interactions and determine how these define the identity of each neuron. Aim 4. Regulation of the mode of neuroblast division and neuronal survival or death by temporal patterning We will investigate how temporal transcription factors act on the cell cycle and on pro-apoptotic genes to characterize the different strategies used by distinct parts of the optic lobes to produce specialized neurons. Aim 5. Temporal patterning-independent neurogenesis in lobula complex progenitors We will explore the molecular mechanisms that control a different mode of neurogenesis that produces 3 types of lobula neurons without a temporal series by controlling the rapid exit of neuroblasts from proliferation. This ambitious work will allow us to identify basic principles of neural patterning and diversity generation, which have broad implications for other neuronal systems in flies and vertebrates."
"9450058","A key goal of HIV-1 vaccine development is to induce long-lasting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that can inhibit HIV-1 infection. Messenger (m) RNA has emerged as a promising new vaccine modality that can elicit potent immune responses, while avoiding the safety risks and anti-vector immunity associated with some live virus vaccines. Important targets for bnAb induction are N301, N332 glycans at the base of the gp120 V3 loop. Our overall goals in this grant are 1) To design an mRNA that encodes a V3-glycan mimetope that, when expressed, will bind a V3 glycan UCA; 2) To select and produce mRNA formulations non-GMP that encode HIV-1 Envs for immunization in humanized mice and RMs; and 3) To produce the sequential V3-glycan mRNA vaccine under CGMP conditions, perform toxicity studies, and prepare an IND for testing in a Phase I trial in man. Overall Specific Aim 1. Develop mRNA delivery constructs for sequential Env trimers for V3-glycan bnAb B cell lineage vaccinations. Hypotheses: Messenger RNA vaccination of humanized mice, Rhesus macaques and humans will induce long-lasting anti-V3 glycan bnAb epitope antibodies, and mRNA vaccination will promote sequential somatic hypermutations and affinity maturation in V3-glycan targeted B cell lineages. Overall Specific Aim 2. Produce CGMP mRNA immunogens. Hypotheses: Messenger RNAs can be produced and encapsulated in potent nanoparticle formulations under CGMP for use in human Phase I trials, and will be safe and immunogenic. Moreover, the mRNA immunogens selected for CGMP production will produce stable Env trimers upon transfection of cell lines in vitro and after immunization in vivo in humanized mice. Expectations and Impact on the Field. Messenger RNAs are the current most promising vaccine strategy for inducing high-titered and long-lasting antibody responses. A successful first in man Phase I clinical trial with clinical trials materials produced in this IPCAVD will change the field by showing the plausibility of initiation of V3-glycan bnAb B cell lineages."
"9424325","Mammographic density (MD) and mutations in BRCA1 (BRCA1 MT) are two strong risk factors for breast cancer. Clarifying the molecular basis of the cancer risk in these highrisk women and identifying biomarkers to identify women who would benefit from closer surveillance and chemoprevention, and validating molecular pathways towards which approved therapies exist is clinically important. We found that the extracellular matrix (ECM) in women with high MD and those with BRCA1 MTs is stiffer and that a stiff ECM sensitizes mammary epithelial cells (MECs) to progesterone to induce more receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL). RANK stimulates breast cell growth, expands stem cells, and induces inflammation and breast cancer metastasis. We detected more RANKL in the breasts of women with high MD, and data suggest RANK receptors are higher in breast tissue from women with BRCA1 MTs who have more breast stem cells and develop triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Studies also suggest RANK activity may be higher in African American (AA) women who often develop TNBCs. Thus, we predict that risk to malignancy in women with high MD is fostered by a stiff ECM because it sensitives the epithelium to progesterone to increase RANK signaling that drives breast cell growth and tissue inflammation and expands breast stem cell frequency. This phenotype could also explain the predilection to develop TNBCs in other high-risk women with BRCA1 MTs and AA women who prior studies suggest may have higher RANK signaling. We will test this by: 1) Determining in mouse models if tissue mechanics drives mammary gland transformation and metastasis by enhancing Rank signaling and driving cell growth and inflammation and stem cell expansion. 2) Exploring associations and causality between Rank, inflammation and stem cell frequency and ECM stiffness in breast tissue from women at high risk for cancer and those who develop TNBCs, and in breast tissue from BRCA1 MT women treated with the RANKL inhibitor Denosumab. 3) Determining how ECM stiffness sensitives MECs to progesterone, and if the breast tissue in women at higher risk to malignancy or TNBCs are intrinsically sensitive to progesterone or RANKL. The studies will: 1) Identify RANK signaling as a biomarker for breast cancer risk and TNBCs and will provide evidence to support chemoprevention trials using RANKL inhibitors. 3) Provide a biological basis for the increased risk conferred by MD, 4) Clarify mechanisms whereby BRCA1 MTs increase breast cancer and provide biomarkers to stratify risk in this population. 5) Obtain insight into the biological basis of the aggressive TNBC breast cancers in AA women."
"9561665","Project Summary This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Rachel Rutishauser, MD, PhD, a fellow in Infectious Diseases at the University of California, San Francisco who is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented studies of HIV immunology. Her goal is to apply her PhD graduate school background in basic CD8+ T cell biology to study the mechanisms that underlie protective and dysfunctional immune responses in HIV infection. Nearly forty million people worldwide are infected with HIV and identifying interventions to induce HIV remission or cure is an NIH high priority research area. Many approaches propose to do so by eliciting protective HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. However, in order to be effective, these therapies need to overcome HIV- specific CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Exhaustion is defined as a loss in the regenerative capacity of antigen- specific CD8+ T cells to proliferate and generate functional effector cells. This K23 award will provide Dr. Rutishauser with the support to explore how HIV-specific CD8+ T cell exhaustion is regulated by: (1) memory CD8+ T cell-associated transcriptional programs, (2) tissue microenvironments, and (3) chronic inflammation. Specifically, she will perform phenotypic, functional, and single-cell transcriptomic analysis of HIV-specific MHC Class I tetramer+ CD8+ T cells from the peripheral blood, lymph node, and gut tissue of thirty HIV- infected individuals who she will recruit from the UCSF-based SCOPE cohort from three clinical groups: individuals who naturally control infection (controllers), as well as non-controllers on and off of antiretroviral therapy (ART). She will also determine if reducing chronic inflammation can enhance HIV-specific CD8+ T cell function by leveraging peripheral blood samples from an ongoing NIH-funded clinical study (NCT02272946) of ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals who are administered the IL-1? inhibitor, canakinumab. To achieve these goals, Dr. Rutishauser will be co-mentored by Dr. Peter Hunt, an HIV translational immunologist and expert in the mechanisms of HIV immune activation, Dr. Joseph Mike McCune, a laboratory-based scientist who has made several fundamental discoveries about HIV pathogenesis, Dr. Steven Deeks, a leader in the HIV cure field, and Dr. Mark Ansel, an immunologist with expertise in T cell differentiation. Through a focused program of mentored training and coursework, the candidate will develop advanced skills in clinical research, human translational immunology, and single-cell transcriptional analysis. The results of these studies are anticipated to be directly relevant to HIV cure research and widely applicable to developing treatments for other disease states in which exhausted antigen-specific CD8+ T cells arise, such as other chronic infections and cancer. Ultimately, the training and research plans outlined here will support Dr. Rutishauser as she transitions from being a basic immunologist and clinical infectious disease specialist to being a translational researcher equipped with the skills to pursue an independent career focused on elucidating the fundamental principles of CD8+ T cell biology and informing the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases."
"9405011","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the mechanistic and genetic basis for the Mre11 complex's role in the suppression of malignancy. Using yeast and mouse models, it focuses primarily on DNA repair and DNA damage signaling alterations imparted by alleles of RAD50 that affect the coiled-coil and hook domains of the protein. We the mutants derived in this effort are separations of function that will allow us to define the role of particuar Mre11 complex-dependent mechanisms meiosis, DNA repair, and the suppression of tumorigenesis. The governing hypothesis of this proposal is that the Mre11 complex suppresses tumorigenesis through its effect on chromosome integrity in addition to its influence on DNA damage signaling. We propose a series of experiments in mice and yeast to address the cancer preventing functions of the complex. First, we investigate the importance of recruitment of DNA repair factors by the Mre11 complex. Second, we examine the effect of mutations within the Rad50 hook domain on NHEJ and HR. Third, we integrate the knowledge gained in the first two Aims for the analysis of new mouse models for Rad50 dysfunction that selectively impair NHEJ. Genetic interactions with these mice and mice mutants in p53, ATM and PTEN will be examined to test the hypothesis that chromosome instability in Rad50 mutants will increase the penetrance of mutations affecting these tumor suppressor proteins and predispose to cancer."
"9447570","Abstract Liver cirrhosis is the leading cause of end-stage liver disease. A hallmark of cirrhosis is fibrogenesis: secretion and deposition of excess extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Prominent among secreted ECM proteins is collagen I. Although the role of collagen I deposition in cirrhosis is well known, therapies aimed at disrupting fibrogenesis are lacking. This is due in part to our poor understanding of procollagen I trafficking through the secretory pathway. Fibrogenic signals such as TGF? drive expression of the collagen I precursor procollagen I, which is subsequently cotranslationed into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Procollagen I fibrils oligomerize within the ER, forming a complex too large (~300nm) to package into canonical ER export vesicles (60-90nm). Thus, additional, unknown cellular machinery is necessary for procollagen I trafficking. If this machinery is disrupted, procollagen fibrils would be retained in the ER and lead to ER stress, activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and possibly apoptosis. Recent elegant studies performed in non-liver cells suggested that TANGO1 is critical for the transport of procollagens. Whether TANGO1 facilitates ER export and secretion of collagen I from HSCs, a critical step in fibrogenesis, is unknown. We hypothesize that TANGO1 drives procollagen I export from the ER, requires UPR signaling to mediate this effect, and together TANGO1 and the UPR are critical for fibrogenesis in vivo. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data showing (a) TANGO1 knockdown disrupts procollagen I ER export, leading to UPR signaling and HSC apoptosis, (b) TANGO1 expression is mediated, at least in part, by the UPR-activated transcription factor XBP1, and (c) TANGO1+/- mice are protected from cirrhosis development. The novelty and relevance of studying the role of TANGO1 in procollagen I trafficking and its regulation are two-fold: 1) we can identify new targets to disrupt collagen I secretion in fibrogenesis, and 2) failure to resolve ER stress driven by procollagen I retention may lead to HSC apoptosis. The latter mechanism is favorable for fibrosis resolution. Our long-term goal is to elucidate mechanisms of procollagen I trafficking within HSCs and identify novel therapeutic targets to treat liver cirrhosis. The research proposed here will utilize rigorous in vitro and in vivo approaches to unveil the mechanisms of TANGO1-mediated procollagen I trafficking in HSCs, the regulatory relationship between TANGO1 and the UPR during HSC activation, and finally the role of TANGO1 and the UPR in fibrogenesis and fibrosis regression."
"9413353","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) precede ultimate liver failure. The current epidemic of childhood obesity has increased NAFLD in children, and the global form of NAFLD due to undernutrition occurs in lean individuals with insulin deficiency. This form is also seen in intra-uterine growth restricted (IUGR) infants who express postnatal cholestatic liver disease. Despite certain standard interventions, some infants at both extremes of malnutrition, progress to requiring liver transplantation in Western countries. Many infants succumb, awaiting organs and despite successful liver transplantation develop complications. Given this dismal outlook, it is essential to discover novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets towards preventing NAFLD before biochemical features manifest and clinical complications arise. To this end, we developed in rat gestational models, undernutrition induced IUGR and high fat (HF) diet induced postnatal obesity, both developed NAFLD. Preliminarily, the adult HF or IUGR offspring, both displayed increased hepatic and serum microRNA (miR)-122, a biomarker of hepatic damage in human adults. Similar to rat, miR-122 was detected in human umbilical cord and infant sera providing the possibility of predicting hepatic disease in large for gestational age (LGA) and IUGR high risk children. Two of the novel target genes that contain complementary sequences to miR-122 in their 3'-untranslated region (UTR) are nocturnin (Noc; rhythmic output gene) and Methyl-CP-binding protein 2 [Mecp2], a nuclear protein, that binds methylated CpG islands in gene promoters. Based on our preliminary novel observations related to miR-122, Noc and Mecp2, we hypothesize that 1) hepatic miR-122 via its target mRNAs, predicts subsequent NAFLD, and 2) postnatal suppression of miR-122 can reverse the subsequent trajectory of NAFLD, possibly translating a preventive therapeutic modality to high risk children. To test these hypotheses, we plan to employ rat models of gestational exposure to a HF diet (HF offspring) versus calorie restriction (IUGR), both with postnatal exposure to a HF diet, and human umbilical cord and infant sera in the following specific aims: 1. To investigate the mechanistic role of miR-122 and its target genes Noc and Mecp2 in enhancing hepatic lipid synthesis resulting in NAFLD. 2. To examine the effect of postnatal in-vivo suppression of miR-122 on key hepatic gene expression thereby aborting development of NAFLD. 3. To explore the possibility of miR-122 serving as a biomarker in a) human LGA and IUGR infants by detection and quantification in umbilical cord serum and b) serum from older infants with established liver injury. Results of our proposed studies will provide a biomarker by which LGA and IUGR infants can be tracked for their hepatic health and a pre-clinical therapeutic strategy that prevents NAFLD. These results will provide tools necessary to translate our findings to high-risk infants towards ameliorating subsequent NAFLD, a pre-runner of liver failure with its morbidity and mortality."
"9290915","Abstract (Project Summary) The overall goal of the proposed project is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying the relationships between a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and alcohol and other substance use outcomes in women. Women with CSA history have earlier onset of alcohol misuse and higher rates of alcohol use disorders, even after controlling for family background factors influencing both CSA exposure and problem drinking, such as family history of alcoholism. Converging evidence suggests that CSA and its consequences for brain development may constitute a distinct etiological pathway to alcoholism in women. However, neural, cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes and mechanisms underlying the link between CSA and alcohol abuse are not well understood. Existing research on neurobehavioral consequences of CSA have typically relied on small samples and insufficiently matched control groups limiting control for family-level confounding factors and causal inferences. The proposed study seeks to address these gaps in knowledge and methodological challenges by utilizing a unique resource consisting of several large, well-characterized, longitudinal samples and implementing a model-driven set of experimental paradigms to test the hypothesis that problem drinking in CSA+ women is mediated by biased affective processing and dysfunction in cognitive control, leading to dysregulated affect and, consequently, coping motives for drinking. The proposed studies are strongly grounded in the current theories of addiction and supported by preliminary findings from our laboratory. Young adult women with a history of early CSA (n=80) and propensity score-matched controls (n=120, including 40 CSA- co-twins from CSA-discordant MZ twin pairs) will participate in a laboratory session involving face-to-face interviews, behavioral and cognitive testing, and the recording of quantitative EEG and ERPs in several behavioral paradigms. The following Specific Aims will be pursued: 1) to elucidate behavioral and psychophysiological mechanisms underlying the relationship between CSA, alcohol, and other substance use outcomes in women, 2) to examine alcohol cue reactivity (ACR) in CSA+ and CSA- women and its relationship with drinking motives and problem drinking, and 3) to determine whether observed differences associated with CSA represent consequences of abuse rather than pre-existing vulnerabilities by using the cotwin control design. In summary, the proposed project is aimed at bridging important gaps in knowledge and will be one of the first well-powered and well-controlled inquiries into the neurobehavioral pathways and mechanisms underlying an important etiological pathway to alcoholism in women. Several aspects of the proposed research are particularly novel: the use of propensity score matching and discordant twin analyses to control for potential confounding variables, focus on a specific etiological pathway to alcoholism in women; and explication of neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying the link between CSA and alcohol problems."
"9461907","The Phylodynamics-targeted Partner service Models (P2M) project aims to guide and transform the rapidly evolving public health implementation of molecular HIV surveillance (MHS) based prevention interventions as a critical step towards HIV elimination. P2M seeks to study and optimize emerging new national guidance: The CDC's March 2017 recommendations of the HIV Cluster Guidance Working Group on health department implementation of MHS with clinical HIV resistance genotypes, now recommended at entry to care. These HIV-1 pol sequences can be used to identify ?molecular clusters? of persons with genetically similar HIV. The overarching goal of MHS is to identify persons within the risk environment. These persons are potential sources, or recipients, of new HIV transmissions, and defined as: 1) new HIV seropositives (including recent/acute infections); 2) previously known HIV seropositives with detectable viral load (in care or not); and 3) at-risk HIV seronegatives. The yield of these persons in the risk environment is an important metric of the usefulness of MHS-based partner services or other network recruitment procedures (ie 2-step) that will be examined in P2M. Thus, P2M aims to rigorously test the hypotheses that: (a) analyzing molecular cluster data closer to time of HIV diagnosis will increase the yield of risk environment members; and (b) targeted prevention using advanced partner and network service approaches our team has innovated will also increase yield and improve effectiveness of public health combination interventions. It is not feasible, however, to conduct a series of randomized trials to test these hypotheses. Modeling approaches, however, are best suited for providing guidance when multiple approaches and conceivable conditions exist, the contexts do not lend themselves to research trials, and where multiple downstream outcomes are possible. For P2M, members of this multi- institutional investigative team (from Houston and Chicago) will build upon existing HIV TRACE collaborations, observational cohorts of populations most impacted by HIV and an existing Agent-Based HIV transmission model (ABM) to guide and prioritize interventions. Accordingly, we aim to: Aim 1) Determine the relative effectiveness of partner services targeted to HIV TRACE derived molecular clusters compared to partner services as currently delivered without molecular cluster targeting (standard of care) to yield persons in the risk environment. Aim 2) Optimize several cluster size and time thresholds by parameterizing an agent-based model with existing cohort data that best yield categories of individuals in the risk environment based upon: 1) time-to-molecular cluster identification; 2) molecular cluster number and size; and 3) real-time versus delayed partner services response to cluster growth. Aim 3a) Model relative effectiveness of combined molecular surveillance and next-generation partner services ? 2-step, 3-step and social network referral ? that best yield persons in the risk environment; Aim 3b) Explore simulated HIV prevention interventions (ie. PrEP) and their cost as they are modeled within real-world molecular cluster and partner/network service strategies."
"9456193","ABSTRACT Although significant progress has been made in neonatal intensive care units, preterm infants continue to suffer from significant morbidities and comorbidities such as hypoxia-ischemia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and white matter injury/periventricular leukomalacia. For example, 65-85% of extreme preterm infants (? 28 weeks of gestational age) have patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) at first week of life, which leads to shunting of blood between the systemic and the pulmonary circulations. Because of many complications associated with PDA, the majority of extreme preterm infants receive medical or surgical therapy in an attempt to close the PDA. However, PDA and associated treatment procedures may cause large perturbations in cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism, thus impacting neonatal brain health. Currently, there is no clinically accepted quantitative monitor for continuous bedside assessment of neonatal brain health. We propose to develop and test a near-infrared diffuse speckle contrast flow-oximeter (DSCFO), which will enable simultaneous quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood oxygen saturation (StO2), and cerebral metabolic rate of tissue oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in infants' brains. The DSCFO uses two small laser diodes at different wavelengths (690 nm and 830 nm) and a tiny bare complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor chip with no lenses to rapidly quantify spatial diffuse speckle fluctuations resulting from moving red blood cells for CBF measurements in relatively deep tissues (up to 8 mm). Alternative measurements of light intensity changes at the two wavelengths will enable quantification of StO2 variations. Knowing CBF and StO2 together will allow for the derivation of CMRO2. Compared to conventional near-infrared diffuse optical technologies, DSCFO is an innovative design with significantly lower cost (<$2500), a faster sampling rate (milliseconds), more detection channels on the high- resolution CMOS pixel array, and a smaller probe (25 mm x 15 mm), which is particularly applicable to cerebral monitoring in the small heads of newborn infants. In Specific Aim 1, the proposed DSCFO device will be constructed and calibrated in head-simulating tissue phantoms and adults' forearms against other established standards. In Specific Aim 2, the calibrated DSCFO device will be further examined in clinic to measure CBF, StO2, and CMRO2 in preterm infants with PDA undergoing indomethacin treatment. We hypothesize that neonatal cerebral hemodynamics/metabolism altered by the PDA and treatment can be detected by the DSCFO, which should reasonably correlate with other physiological measures and clinical outcomes. The measurement of multiple cerebral hemodynamic/metabolic variables together (i.e., CBF, StO2, and CMRO2) is expected to provide better assessment of neonatal brain health than a single parameter alone, which may help optimize patient care and reduce adverse cerebral impacts. Furthermore, the DSCFO has the potential to be used for cerebral diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of many other diseases in infants (e.g., hypoxic/ischemic injury, shock/hypotension, intermittent hypoxemia)."
"9117284","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The burden of prostate cancer among Veterans is substantial with over 200,000 survivors and  12,000 new diagnoses annually. Most men live with rather than die from this common disease  making prostate cancer survivorship care especially important. Because of its leadership in  chronic disease care and the proportion of older men served, the Veterans Health  Administration (VHA) is well positioned to become one of the national leaders in prostate cancer  survivorship care. However, the quality of Veteran prostate cancer survivorship care is largely  unknown. In addition, there is poor consensus about whether primary care providers or cancer  specialists should have primary responsibility for ongoing cancer surveillance and management  of treatment-related side effects (e.g., incontinence, osteoporosis). Ultimately, the design and  implementation of tools to optimize prostate cancer survivorship care rests upon understanding  how responsibility for survivorship care is managed and the barriers to good survivorship care.  This research program will improve our understanding of Veteran prostate cancer survivorship  care and seek to improve it using state-of-the-art implementation science methods. This  program has three aims. Aim 1: To examine variation in 2 key quality indicators of prostate  cancer survivorship care. Using national VHA data (2005-2011), we will examine variation in  the quality of prostate cancer survivorship care for cancer surveillance and bone density testing.  Aim 2: To assess barriers and facilitators to delivering high quality prostate cancer  survivorship care. Guided by theory, we will perform focus groups and interviews with primary  care providers and prostate cancer specialists to better understand how to improve survivorship  care. Aim 3: To develop, implement and pilot a theory-based intervention to improve the  quality of prostate cancer survivorship care. We will use our findings to pilot an intervention  that addresses quality gaps in cancer surveillance and bone density testing uncovered in Aim 1,  in preparation for a randomized trial. Due to the expanding population of Veteran prostate  cancer survivors, optimizing their quality of survivorship care is of the utmost importance. Our  findings will inform models for cancer survivorship care across VHA and guide future  implementation efforts to improve the quality of cancer care."
"9451314","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating inflammatory bowel disease affecting approximately 10% of premature infants born <1500gm. There is currently no means of predicting, preventing, or specifically treating this disease. The two primary risk factors for NEC are prematurity and bacterial colonization. This proposal is focused on understanding the function of the early intestinal microbiota. Specifically, the goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of early human microbiota in the development of the immature intestine, and the mechanism by which this microbiota-host interaction alters susceptibility to NEC. Based on preliminary data demonstrating differences in the microbial communities of preterm infants who do or do not develop NEC, and differences in inflammatory signaling and barrier function associated with different preterm infant microbial communities, we hypothesize that optimal early microbial intestinal colonization enhances development of the immature preterm gut and exhibits stability despite clinical perturbations thus protecting against NEC. We propose to investigate the role of early microbial communities in infants who ultimately develop or do not develop NEC by using 1. Metagenomic sequencing to determine differences in functional microbial gene sequence of the overall community; 2. Germ-free mouse transfaunation to investigate the effect of the early microbial community on intestinal phenotype; 3. Chemostat bioreactors to measure the stability of the microbial community and volatile organic compounds (VOC) produced in response to clinically relevant perturbations; 4. Enteroid culture models to investigate mechanistic links between VOCs produced and inflammation or barrier function alterations in immature intestinal epithelial cells. Use of human preterm infant samples will ensure clinical relevance. We also propose to create defined experimental communities (DECs) of cultured organisms that are representative of the early microbiota from infants who do or do not go on to develop NEC. These DECs can form the basis for a potential future microbial ecotherapeutic intervention to optimize microbial colonization patterns in premature infants to promote normal intestinal development and prevent NEC in these vulnerable patients. These studies will also allow assessment of microbial community stability to enable understanding of how clinical interventions early in life are influencing this critical earl microbiota, to prompt informed clinical practice alterations."
"9507071","PROJECT SUMMARY Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) develops in about a half of all cancer patients receiving anti-neoplastic drugs, such as the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel (PTX). Because there is no effective treatment, painful CIPN is one of the most common causes of early termination of chemotherapy. We found, in time-lapse imaging studies of cultured mouse sensory neurons expressing mitochondria-targeting fluorescent protein (mitoDendra), that (i) the reduction of distal neurite mitochondrial density, emerging within 3 hours of PTX exposure, constitutes one of the earliest signs of PTX-CIPN (PCIPN) in vitro and precedes subsequent neurite degeneration; and (ii) the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis via activation of peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-? coactivator (PGC) 1?, mitigates these phenotypes. In this R21 application, we will take advantage of our in vitro and in vivo PCIPN models to determine, with particular focus on the AMPK-PGC1? axis, the mechanism by which AICAR counteracts this condition. SA-I: To assess the impact of AICAR and PGC1? activation on PCIPN in vitro - AICAR acts on PGC1? via activation of AMPK, which also modulates tau and glycogen synthase kinase 3? involved in the regulation of microtubule stability and thus may affect the PCIPN phenotypes. To gain insights into the disease pathogenesis and the mechanism of action of AICAR, we will assess temporal changes of these proteins in cultured sensory neurons treated with PTX, AICAR, or both. To correlate the molecular data obtained with the PCIPN phenotypes, we will grow mitoDendra sensory neurons in a compartment culture system, which allows us to spatiotemporally evaluate changes of neurites and their mitochondria. To determine the significance of activating PGC1?, the neurons will also be treated with nicotinamide riboside, which activates PGC1? independent of AMPK. SA-II: To evaluate the therapeutic potential of AICAR and PGC1? overexpression for PCIPN in vivo - To compare therapeutic efficacy at different stages of PCIPN, AICAR or vehicle will be given before, at the time of, or after inducing PCIPN in the mice. Outcome measures will include histological and a series of nociception assays. To determine the significance of the PGC1? pathway, PCIPN in mice overexpressing PGC1? in sensory neurons under the inducible promotor will be compared with PCIPN in non-induced littermates treated with or without AICAR. Study Impact: The proposed studies will provide novel insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms and new therapeutic strategies for PCIPN. The results obtained will be advanced, in our future research, to new preclinical studies in animals, targeting more disease-specific molecules, and further elucidating the disease mechanisms. Upon in vivo validation of its efficacy and safety in our pre-clinical study, AICAR, which is readily-available as a nutritional supplement and has anti-tumor effects, would be translated rapidly to the clinic."
"9624035","Central questions in the neurobiology of learning and memory are where and how experience modifies the brain to alter behavior. Recently we have described a physiological phenomenon in head-fixed awake mice termed stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP), in which responsiveness of primary visual cortex is markedly enhanced as a result of repeated exposure to specific visual stimuli. This robust form of plasticity is induced and expressed in the adult primary visual cortex and displays many of the features that are characteristic of perceptual learning. The primary aims of this research are to; a) to determine the behavioral significance of SRP using two novel behavioral assays; b) determine how SRP is expressed at the cellular level within visual cortex and; c) pinpoint the synapses that are modified. Beyond the relevance of our proposed research to identifying the mechanisms underlying perceptual learning and/or visual recognition memory, they will broaden our understanding of how primary sensory areas are modified by sensory experience in order to modify behavior, which remains one of the great challenges in basic neuroscience."
"9420616","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Ionizing Radiation kills cancer cells by generating DNA damage. Resistance to Ionizing Radiation is generally determined by DNA repair mechanisms that can repair radiation-induced DNA damage. The most toxic effect of radiation is represented by the formation of double stranded DNA breaks. These breaks can be repaired by Homologous Recombination, and Non-Homologous End Joining DNA repair mechanisms. Inhibition of these mechanisms results in increased radiosensitivity since repair of radiation-induced double strand breaks is blocked. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms of double strand break repair is essential for designing novel radiosensitization therapies.  We have recently uncovered a novel mechanism that regulates radioresistance, centered on the protein PARP14. PARP14 is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, which unlike its well-known cousin PARP1 is unable to catalyze poly-ADP-ribose chain formation but can only transfer a single molecule of ADP-ribose to substrates. Mono-ADP-ribosylation is a still mysterious post-translational modification, and its functions in the cell are poorly characterized. Or preliminary results presented here show that PARP14 promotes repair of double strand breaks by activating Homologous Recombination DNA repair. Moreover, our preliminary results presented here indicate a mechanism for this activation: PARP14 mono-ADP-ribosylates the recombination factor RAD51 to promote RAD51 removal from D-loops thus allowing D-loop extension past the break and complete the recombination reaction. Thus, our work shows that PARP14 inhibition results in radiosensitivity by downregulating Homologous Recombination-dependent repair of radiation-induced double strand DNA breaks.  In this proposal, we test the hypothesis that PARP14 promotes the repair of radiation-induced double strand DNA breaks by Homologous Recombination, through RAD51 mono-ADP-ribosylation. We will employ a comprehensive, integrative approach to study: 1) the impact of PARP14 on the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage by Homologous Recombination and other DNA repair mechanisms, and 2) the role of RAD51 mono- ADP-ribosylation by PARP14 in repair of radiation-induced double strand breaks.  Our study is highly innovative since it addresses a novel, previously unrecognized function of mono- ADP-ribosylation in radioresistance. Our work will unravel how mono-ADP-ribosylation by PARP14 promotes radiation resistance, and describe novel radiosensitization approaches, based on PARP14 inhibition."
"9517405","ABSTRACT DNA damage can occur from extrinsic sources e.g., irradiation or intrinsic sources, e.g., unresolved transcriptional R-loops (DNA-RNA hybrids plus displaced single-stranded DNA). The cell employs multiple mechanisms not only to repair the damage but to also promote cell survival while repair is underway. One recently described mechanism promoting cell survival following DNA damage involves fragmentation and dispersal of Golgi-complex throughout the cytosol, aims known as Golgi-dispersal response (GDR) (Farber-Katz et al., 2014). Here, impaired GDR resulted in cell death. Because lymphocytes from patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an X-linked primary immunodeficiency disorder, undergo spontaneous, accelerated apoptosis (Rawlings et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2017), we hypothesized that impaired GDR underlies progressive lymphopenia in WAS, and that a defect in GDR contributes, at least in part, to the development of immunodeficiency. The concept that WASp has an essential cytoplasmic role in the DNA damage response and repair (DDR) signaling is innovative, because WASp role in cytoplasm has traditionally been restricted to remodeling F-actin cortical cytoskeleton in the context of TCR activation. In strong support of this hypothesis, are our preliminary findings demonstrating a profoundly inhibited GDR following ?-irradiation-induced DNA strand breaks in WASp-deficient T cells. That the GDR event could be of immediate physiological relevance to the lymphocyte biology is further supported by our findings that WASp-deficiency triggers ectopic accumulation of unresolved R loops, the latter, we show generates DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during Th1 gene activation. We, therefore, propose that the transcription-linked DNA damage in WAS lymphocytes will not accompany cell protective GDR, and the degree of GDR dysfunction will correlate with disease severity grades in WAS. Aim 1 focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which loss of WASp disrupts the GDR signaling pathway, focusing on the formation and function of DNA-PK- GOLPH3-F-actin-MYO18A complex during DNA damage, both ?-irradiation-mediated and transcriptional R-loop-mediated. In Aim 2, we will ask how disease-causing, WAS gene mutations differ in disrupting GDR signaling in Th1, Th2, and B cells, and investigate how WAS mutations that cause increased F-actin or decreased F-actin differentially influence GDR competency. Therefore, if successful, we would identify a novel cytoplasmic role of WASp in the DDR pathway, and uncover GDR defect as etiologic of a primary immunodeficiency disorder."
"9417041","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Florida, College of Medicine has a long tradition and record of accomplishments in the training of medical students for careers in academic medicine and research. This application is a resubmission of a competitive renewal of a T35 Short-Term Training for Medical Students in Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Research that was first awarded to the School in 1981 and now in its 30th year. The purpose of the training grant is to provide intensive, short-term (2.5 month) training in research for twenty 1st year medical students (MS1) whose projects focus on heart, lung, and blood topics that will be conducted under the guidance of faculty mentors who have a proven record of outstanding research and training of pre-doctoral and post- doctoral medical and graduate students. Beginning in the Fall of 2013 with the entering Class of 2017, the core medical curriculum will include the Discovery Pathways Program (DPP), which will extend across all four years of medical training. All 135 medical students in the Class of 2017 will select a research and discovery (R&D) project and faculty mentor from the hundreds of projects grouped within one of the six Discovery Tracks, and they will initiate their R&D projects in the 10-weeks of the summer following completion of the Spring semester courses. This broad range of potential research topics is made possible because of the diversity of the research areas of the more than 800 faculty members of the College of Medicine, including the 42 T35 Program Faculty. The participation of all MS1s in the DPP will ensure an even larger pool of quality R&D projects from which the 20 MS1s will be selected to receive the T35 NHLBI scholarships (2 of the 20 scholarships will be funded by the College of Medicine). The DPP curriculum during the first year includes instruction in fundamentals of R&D, including tools for literature surveys, generating hypothesis driven questions, biomedical statistics, scientific report writing, interpreting evidenced based medicine guidelines, and responsible conduct of research. The T35 students will receive additional enrichment in R&D training through weekly T35 student group meetings, peer presentations of research projects, extensive training in preparing abstracts, posters and grant proposals, attending special lectures and participating in activities with key personnel from the Clinical and Translational Science Institute. During the 2nd and 3rd years of medical classes, the T35 students and their classmates will continue meeting with their faculty mentor and advancing their research projects through various mechanisms including elective courses, seminars, research group meetings. During the 4th year, T35 students and their classmates will take two 4-week elective courses to complete their R&D projects and they will generate a capstone scholarly work product such as a research journal paper. Long term follow up of T35 trainees indicates the research experience gained by the T35 trainees has substantial impact on their research productivity and careers, and the DPP and the enriched T35 program will enhance that outcome."
"9554088","Project Summary The continued spread of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections has rendered tuberculosis (TB) a global health pandemic and pressed home the urgent need for new drugs. Compounds which inhibit essential components of the Mtb cell wall rapidly cause cell death and are represented clinically by isoniazid. If any drug combination is likely to reduce treatment duration and prevent the emergence of new antibacterial resistance, it will be a sterilizing synergistically acting therapy. In this proposal, our aim is to develop a new TB therapy that targets a validated druggable pathway and commences with a validated lead compound. The long- term goal is a new drug effective against both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant Mtb. The drug lead DG167 targets KasA, an essential enzyme involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis. The atomic-scale interactions between KasA and DG167 and multiple analogs of differing chemotype have been established in high-resolution X-ray crystal structures. Our work corrects a previous GSK structure and shows that two molecules of DG167 are bound in KasA. DG167 shows synergy in killing studies with the established drug isoniazid. DG167/isoniazid combinations lead to rapid sterilization of Mtb cultures and show synergy in a mouse model of acute Mtb infection. A DG167/isoniazid combination could shorten TB treatment by accelerating clearance of replicating bacteria in acute TB disease. Here, we propose to advance lead optimization of DG167. Our experienced project team is comprised of academic and industrial researchers with an established track record of collaboration and the common goal of devising new antitubercular drug therapies. The complimentary key skill sets in medicinal chemistry, cheminformatics, structural biology, microbiology, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics are all present and will be leveraged to deliver an optimized lead candidate inhibitor of Mtb KasA with enhanced in vivo efficacy as compared to the early lead DG167. This will prepare us for a Phase II program that would complete the optimization and set the stage for pre-IND toxicology studies."
"9601228","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) controls DA homeostasis and neurotransmission by the active reuptake of synaptically released DA. The DAT is the major molecular target responsible for the rewarding properties and the abuse potential of amphetamine (AMPH) and cocaine. AMPH acts as a DAT substrate, promoting the reversal of DA transport, thereby resulting in DA efflux via DAT. This efflux leads to increased extracellular DA levels, an event of importance for the psychomotor stimulant properties of AMPHs.  The N-terminus of the DAT is a structural domain that is critical for AMPH to cause DA efflux. We have shown that DAT N-terminus phosphorylation at the five most distal Ser is required for AMPH-induced DA efflux, but does not regulate DA uptake. Furthermore, our preliminary studies suggest that the DAT N-terminus interacts electrostatically with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate PIP2 (a key phospholipid enriched at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane), and that this interaction impairs DA efflux, but not uptake.  Our mechanistic hypothesis is that upon phosphorylation, the DAT N-terminus uncouples from PIP2 to disengage from the membrane. Both of these events are required to elicit the DA efflux produced by AMPH. We propose to test our hypothesis and its implications for the behavioral effects of AMPH in vivo, through the following specific aims: 1) To determine the nature of the interaction between DAT N-terminus and PIP2, and describe it in a structural context provided by computational modeling; 2) To determine the role of N-terminus phosphorylation in regulating how DAT and PIP2 interact, and its effect on DAT function; 3) To determine the role of DAT/PIP2 interactions in AMPH-induced behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster. In this animal model, we have established that locomotion is a DAT-dependent behavior and is stimulated by AMPH. Deletion of Drosophila DAT (dDAT) in DA neurons of flies inhibits AMPH-induced locomotion, an effect that is restored by the expression of the human DAT (hDAT) in these dDAT-deficient DA neurons. Using this strategy, we will translate in vivo our molecular findings from specific aims 1 and 2. This will allow us to understand how hDAT N-terminus phosphorylation and associations with PIP2 determine AMPH-induced behaviors.  The long-term goals of this research are to understand how AMPH-induced DA efflux and its associated behaviors are dictated by the interactions of hDAT N-terminus with PIP2, and/or by phosphorylation of the N- terminus. By specifically impairing DA efflux, but not uptake, we will determine the contribution of DA efflux in AMPH behaviors. The intent is to uncover novel targets for the treatment of AMPH abuse. From a broad perspective of transporter biology, we will reveal how a DAT structural domain (the N-terminus) via its interactions with the plasma membrane dictates different aspects of transport function."
"9415029","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 2, 3, 7, 8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent, lipophilic environmental contaminant that exerts toxicity through binding the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The overall goal of this research is to understand how exposure to TCDD and other AhR agonists disrupts development of the forebrain and cerebral vasculature and, ultimately, how AhR agonist exposure may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive impairment. My preliminary data suggest that early embryonic exposure to TCDD severely disrupts the development of the forebrain and associated cerebral vasculature in zebrafish. The genetic and molecular tools available in zebrafish make it an excellent model for studying neurovascular development and toxicity. However, relatively few studies have used the zebrafish model to examine how TCDD-induced activation of Ahr2 impacts brain and cerebral vascular development. In Aim 1, using confocal microscopy, fluorescent- immunohistochemistry (F-IHC) and Olympus software, the candidate will create 3D reconstructions of TCDD-exposed and control brains for a detailed analysis and quantification of forebrain phenotypes. TCDD-induced changes in the cerebral vasculature will be quantified using AngioTool software. In addition, the candidate will use exciting new imaging technology to examine cerebral vascular development in vivo, which will provide unique insight into how TCDD-induced phenotypes emerge. In Aim 2, the candidate will manipulate Ahr2 activity in a cell-type specific manner to determine if activation of Ahr2 in either vascular endothelial cells or differentiated neurons is sufficient to produce the observed forebrain and cerebral vascular phenotypes. Downregulation of the transcription factor, sox9b, has emerged as a common mechanism mediating TCDD-induced toxicity in the heart, jaw and fin. Preliminary data indicates sox9b expression in the forebrain is downregulated following TCDD exposure and that loss of sox9b results in forebrain and cerebral vascular phenotypes that resemble TCDD-induced forebrain and cerebral vascular phenotypes. In Aim 3, the candidate will determine if sox9b is also a TCDD target in the developing brain and elucidate sox9b function(s) in the development of the forebrain and cerebral vasculature. Importantly, the proposed research will help us understand how AhR activation disrupts neurovascular development and when neurovascular phenotypes emerge during development. This information is essential for understanding potential risks associated with human AhR agonist exposure. The brain is a metabolically intense organ that is highly dependent on proper and continuous cerebral vascularization for normal function. Consequently, this work is relevant not only to embryonic development, but also later life stages. As a K award recipient, the candidate will follow a training plan that outlines very specific research and career development milestones to be reached over the course of the award. To augment my research background in Neuroscience, Developmental Genetics, and Cardiovascular Toxicology, my research aims are coupled with didactic coursework and hands-on training in Neurovascular Biology, Molecular Biology and Neurotoxicology. The activities outlined in this training application will provide me with training in areas needed for a successfu research career including grantsmanship, project design, and laboratory management. A committee composed of an outstanding team of scientists has been assembled is committed to the candidate and her success and are willing to play an active role in facilitating my growth as a scientist. The University of Wisconsin is a top-tier research institute with numerous NIH-sponsored training programs, core facilities, and outstanding researchers, which makes it an ideal training environment for me to develop as an independent scientist. Ultimately, the training in my research and career development plan, my interactions with my mentors, committee members and consultants, and my outstanding training environment will provide an excellent foundation for a successful academic career at a research intensive academic institution."
"9613342","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly evident that rationally designed combination therapies impacting multiple targets will most likely to improve outcomes in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). However, the selective delivery of multiple regimens to the right place, at the right time, and in the correct sequence with consideration of mechanistic interactions remains a major challenge. Light-activated approaches combined with nanotechnology provide a unique opportunity to deliver multiple agents targeted at several key molecular pathways. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a light-based cytotoxic modality that can synergize with chemo and biological agents. PDT is FDA-approved for several cancers and it is in phase III trial for GBM. The underlying hypothesis is that properly timed, nanotechnology-assisted combination therapies based on interactive mechanisms that target multiple non-overlapping tumor growth/survival pathways is key to improving treatment efficacy, and allows for non-overlapping toxicities and reduced dose. This proposal leverages image-guided approaches and polymer engineering to develop a photoimmunoconjugate-nanocarrier (PICNC) that integrates an FDA-approved PDT agent (verteporfin), a clinically promising chemodrug (SN-38), and a multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKi, cediranib). All the agents are compartmentalized for appropriate release kinetics to ensure the correct sequence of action that accounts for the mechanistic synergism of the combination treatment. During the K99 phase, SN-38-loaded nanocarriers will be decorated with cetuximab-verteporfin photoimmunoconjugates (PICs) for tumor targeting and image-guided combination therapy (PDT + SN-38). It is hypothesized that SN- 38 improves tumor tissue oxygenation to favor oxygen-dependent PDT, while PDT destroys efflux pumps to increase intracellular SN-38 levels, will improve the overall outcome. To prepare for R00 transition, Dr. Huang will leverage his chemical engineering background to develop a variety of modified polymer nanoparticles loaded with a third RTKi agent, engineered to modulate the RTKi release kinetics, which will be incorporated into the PICNC. The hypothesis is that the customized RTKi release kinetics will maximize the mitigation of the compensatory RTK survival pathways elicited by PDT and SN-38 to improve outcome. During the R00 phase, Dr. Huang will establish the molecular impact and the image-guided treatment planning of PICNCs, and then evaluate the therapeutic effects of PICNCs and customized PDT schedule. A strong mentoring committee has been assembled to guide Dr. Huang's research and facilitate his transition to independence. Dr. Tayyaba Hasan (primary mentor) will train Dr. Huang in photobiology, PIC-nanocarriers, and combination mechanism. Dr. David Boas (co-mentor) is an expert in optical and spectral imaging of tissue oxygen metabolism. Additional distinguished members are: Dr. Brian Pogue, a fluorescence imaging expert; Dr. Shiladitya Sengupta, an polymer nanoparticle expert; Drs. Robert Martuza, Xandra Breakefield, and Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov are experts in clinical management, animal models and molecular biology of GBM."

These opportunities have been amplified by the emergence of next-generation smartphone devices that are capable of rich multimedia and sophisticated interactivity. Smartphone-based programs can be integrated seamlessly into a user's daily life and natural setting to deliver tailored healt messaging, interactive psychosocial activities, cognitive exercises, momentary assessments and much more. Few studies to date have evaluated strategies for leveraging smartphone applications to promote tobacco prevention and cessation, and very few examples of evidence-based tobacco control programs currently exist for this nearly ubiquitous technology platform. This 3-year Phase II STTR is proposed to enhance and evaluate a smartphone-based program, AppSPIRE, which provides tailored tobacco cessation and prevention training for adolescents and young adults. The intervention is based on an existing evidence-based computer-based program entitled ASPIRE, and is guided by the Transtheoretical Model of Change, Social Cognitive Theory, and Addiction Framework. The aims of this study are to enhance a prototype application that was found to be feasible, usable and acceptable in a Phase I study, and to evaluate the program for efficacy among 400 ethnically diverse students at a large urban community college system. The proposed research will build upon our extensive federally funded line of tobacco and youth projects utilizing behavioral theory and innovative computer technology. The application is based on the considerable experience gained in a number of highly promising tobacco projects conducted by our investigative team. This study will significantly advance our understanding of mobile phone technology-assisted tobacco control among young tobacco users.

"9421539","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of skeletal muscle fibers, which is a prerequisite for all bodily movement as well as for respiration, is initiated by electrical depolarization of the transverse tubules (TTs), causing membrane voltage (V) sensors in the TT dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) to trigger Ca2+ release via the abutting skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1)/Ca2+ release channels in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. However, the molecular mechanisms coupling the TT V sensor to SR RyR1 release activation are poorly understood, and the roles of various modulatory molecules, including S100A1 and calmodulin (CaM) are not clear. These issues are important since any pathologic interference with the Ca2+ release activation process may modify or disrupt muscle function. Here in Aim 1 we identify a previously totally unsuspected marked suppression of muscle Ca2+ release in a transgenic mouse model expressing a hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) CaV1.1 V sensor charge mutation, and characterize the mechanism(s) underlying this defect in muscle activation. Muscle Ca2+ release is also modulated by a variety of accessory proteins. During the current grant cycle we have made the novel finding that the Ca2+ binding protein S100A1 binds to the previously identified calmodulin (CaM) binding domain (CaMBD) in RyR1, which should now be referred to as a CaM/S100A1 binding domain since these molecules interact for binding at this site. In Aims 2 and 3 we utilize shRNA techniques to suppress the protein expression of S100A1, CaM or both S100A1 and CaM to investigate the effects of each of these ligands as well as their competitive interaction at sites other than the CaMBD of RyR1. We will use high speed (<50 us/line) line-scan confocal imaging of fibers containing the Ca2+ indicator fluo-4 to monitor Ca2+ signals and calculate the underlying Ca2+ release flux from the SR during single or trains of action potentials in intact fibers, or during voltage clamp depolarization of whole cell voltage clamped fibers with high levels of EGTA in the patch pipette solution. We will use adult muscle fibers with molecular biologically manipulated expression of endogenous or exogenous proteins. Parallel NMR and binding studies will examine the structures and binding affinities of S100A1 and/or CaM binding to peptides corresponding to the identified binding sites. This project will elucidate basic molecular mechanisms regulating Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle and the roles of voltage sensor charges that are mutated in hypoPP in muscle Ca2+ release. It will characterize the modulation of SR Ca2+ release by S100A1 and CaM, which might be compromised in generalized or specific muscle disease states, or in aging muscle. Thus, this project has high impact for multiple disciplines, and for problems of both locomotion and breathing common to a variety of advanced diseased states and aging."
"9528934","Project Summary In healthy individuals immune tolerance is maintained by populations of regulatory T-cells, including Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Treg). In individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS), Treg numbers are normal in circulation but deficient at sites of autoimmune demyelination. Further, cells from these individuals function well ex vivo but fail to prevent autoimmunity in situ. These data implicate local defects in Treg homeo- stasis in the pathogenesis of RR-MS. However, the factors that regulate Treg homeostasis within peripheral tissues are unknown. A critical factor that governs Treg homeostasis is the cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2) and downstream signaling through STAT5. Without this signaling, Treg revert to being conventional T cells (Tconv) or die. Since Treg cannot make IL-2 themselves, most of what they need comes from other T cells at sites of inflammation. How- ever, IL-2 has a very short half-life in vivo (<6 minutes) because it is very rapidly sequestered into the extracel- lular matrix (ECM) near where it is made. This is particularly a consequence of its binding to heparan sulfate (HS)-containing structures. Nonetheless, ambient IL-2 supports Treg stability and function at sites of recent inflammation, suggesting that these cells may be able to access this resource. We have identified a novel role for heparanase (HPSE), a cell-surface enzyme that binds and digests HS, in supporting Treg access to tissue IL-2. We find that HS-bound IL-2 is more potent than free (unbound) IL-2 in promoting Treg survival but only if cells express HPSE. Consistent with this, HPSE-/- mice have fewer Treg. Concomitantly, HPSE-/- Treg also have impaired phenotypic stability upon transfer in vivo. These effects of HPSE on Treg homeostasis may be mediated at the level of interactions between IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). We find that HS-bound IL-2 potently induces STAT5 signaling in wildtype, but not HPSE-/- Treg. Because IL-2/IL-2R interactions typically trigger internalization and clearance of IL-2 as well as signal- ing, our preliminary data suggest that HPSE may stabilize HS/IL-2/IL-2R complexes in ways that prolong IL-2 signaling. This may be a fundamental mechanism governing Treg survival and function in peripheral tissues. In light of these exciting preliminary data, we hypothesize that FoxP3+ Treg use HPSE to access IL-2 bound to HS within tissues. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will define the role of HPSE in Foxp3+ Treg homeosta- sis and function. Then, in Aim 2 we will elucidate how HPSE potentiates IL-2R signaling. Together, these aims represent a bold, imaginative, and unconventional approach to studying immune homeo- stasis in peripheral tissues. This work will provide the mechanistic foundation needed to support R01 level re- search into the role of HPSE in human MS and the development of novel therapies targeting HPSE to promote immune tolerance."

"9467539","Impact of Sugars and Human Milk Oligosaccharides on Infant Microbiome and Obesity Abstract Hispanic children are at high risk for obesity, a disparity that is already established by 2 years of age. Our prior work found that high dietary sugars in early-life contributes to this increased risk and that this adverse effect was obliterated in children who were exposed to extended (not exclusive) breastfeeding for >12 months. Thus, sugars and extended breastfeeding exert opposing effects on early obesity-risk, but the mechanisms are unclear. One way that dietary sugars and extended breastfeeding could impact infants? obesity-risk is by affecting gut microbiome development, which is rapidly evolving during the first 24 months of life. This is a plausible mechanism given that the gut microbiome is implicated in the development of obesity, and that gut microbial changes have been documented in response to dietary sugars and factors in breast milk. One factor in breast milk that may be directly relevant is the mixture of different human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which reach the colon intact and serve as prebiotics, shaping the diversity of the gut microbiota. Therefore, the effects of HMOs on microbiome development could be one mechanism by which breastfeeding protects against obesity in infants, a novel concept supported by our preliminary data. Exposure to high dietary sugars in infancy could also impact obesity risk by disrupting cognitive function and appetite regulation, and evidence suggests that these effects might also be mediated by the gut microbiome, and that HMOs, can protect against these impairments, but human studies are lacking. We propose to examine these concepts in a cohort study in 240 Hispanic women and their newborn infants. Participants will be followed from birth to 24 months, with frequent sampling and assessment of breast milk for HMO composition, maternal and infant microbiota, maternal and infant diet, and infant eating behaviors. The primary outcome will be infant body fat by DEXA and secondary outcomes will be infant cognition and appetite regulation, including gut-derived appetite hormones in a sub-set. We have 4 Specific Aims: 1) Determine the joint effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on development of the infant gut microbiome; 2) Determine the joint effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on development of infant body fat.; 3) Determine the joint effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on infant cognitive outcomes, eating behavior and appetite regulation; and 4) Determine whether the effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on infant outcomes are mediated by changes in the gut microbiome. This study will move the field forward by identifying how early-life dietary exposures (focusing on dietary sugars, breastfeeding and HMOs) affect gut microbiome development, and how this affects development of obesity, cognition and appetite regulation. Findings are expected to have significant implications for identifying specific HMOs and/or gut microbial changes that will be protective for obesity and inform future novel intervention modalities applicable to Hispanic women and their infants."
"9412852","Project Summary/Abstract This goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which tyrosine recombinases recognize and assemble on their target DNA sequences and achieve coordinated pairwise cleavage of DNA strands to reach a recombined product. The proposal is significant because tyrosine recombinases are widely used genome editing tools, but their potential for improving human health is currently hindered by lack of understanding of their mechanisms for site selection and for control over activity and recombination direction (i.e., integration versus excision). Innovation in this proposal arises from the application of solution NMR to address mechanistic knowledge gaps left unanswered by the many high resolution crystal structures of tyrosine recombinases in tetrameric complexes with DNA. Those structures have provided crisp snapshots of some of the important intermediates in the recombination pathway, but provide limited insight into the intermediates that precede them, or into the mechanisms that interconvert them. Our approach combines powerful protein- and DNA-engineering with sophisticated isotope labeling and NMR methods to characterize dynamics that enable interconversion of key intermediates in site-specific DNA recombination, focusing on those leading to site-specific assembly of the tetrameric synaptic complex, allosteric control over DNA cleavage, and isomerization of the Holliday junction (HJ) intermediate. To understand the conformational changes in both protein and DNA that accompany site selection, dimer assembly, tetramer synapsis and protomer activation, we will use solution NMR spectroscopy to: (1) determine the solution structure of Cre recombinase alone, and bound in pre-synapsed complexes with loxP DNA; (2) determine the role of protein dynamics in activating Cre for DNA cleavage by measuring dynamics in Cre and pre-synaptic complexes with DNA; (3) study how DNA intrinsic dynamics affects Cre recognition, synaptic assembly, control over Cre activity, and direction of recombination; (4) characterize the dynamic and allosteric communication pathways that enable isomerization of the central HJ for progression through the recombination reaction. To enable the NMR experiments on large homo-oligomeric complexes, we will leverage an arsenal of reagents and techniques for selective labeling of protein and DNA molecules, and for assembly of chimeric Cre-DNA complexes; together with uniform deuteration and TROSY methods, the simplified NMR spectra will facilitate resonance assignments and quantitative relaxation measurements. The proposed studies will advance our understanding of the role of dynamics in DNA recombination, and in DNA binding and remodeling enzymes in general. This knowledge could broadly impact biotechnology and its biomedical applications by facilitating the design of Cre variants with defined DNA sequence specificity and improved efficiency, and suggest new avenues for controlling its activity."
"9539133","Project Summary Building on a T90-supported training experience working jointly with scientists in Dentistry and Biostatistics, this project aims to develop new techniques for modeling dental outcome data by drawing on modern data-science techniques for spatially structured data, specifically accounting for both adjacent-tooth and cross-mouth patterns of association. An investigation into alternative possible mechanisms for oral-health consequences of methamphetamine use serves as a motivating example. A recurring narrative in both the clinical literature and media reports has been the frequent presentation of rampant dental disease in habitual methamphetamine (meth) users, a condition described colloquially as ?meth mouth?. The proposed mechanisms for the increased dental disease are the ?contaminant theory?, where corrosive elements are released when meth is smoked inducing acid-mediated erosion of tooth enamel, and a lack of proper oral health behaviors (OHBs) over extended periods of time. Because both theories explain basic features of available data, a more refined data-science framework is needed to help distinguish these alternatives, achieved here by characterizing in greater detail the patterns of association that would be expected under the respective theories. Tests of alternative models can be based on available data from a sample of 571 meth users. Oral-health outcomes were collected following protocols used in the population-based National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), with additional data also collected on meth-use history and other attributes known to be linked to dental disease. Evidence from preliminary investigations of dental caries data points not only to strong spatial patterns of association between adjacent teeth but also to substantial association between corresponding teeth on opposite sides of the mouth. Conditionally autoregressive statistical models for spatial data are in widespread use, but methods for accommodating multiple spatial neighbor relationships have only recently been conceptualized, giving rise to an interdisciplinary research opportunity for statistical-methods development applicable to dental-outcome data. To address missing teeth, the project will also seek to build on techniques in the literature on statistical analysis with incomplete data, in particular with an approach accounting for alternative mechanisms that could explain why teeth are missing. Consistent with the goals of the NIDCR 2014-2019 Strategic Plan, it is anticipated that the proposed methodologies will be applicable to a wide variety of oral-health (and other health-science) research settings."
"9431255","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly-inherited, untreatable neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration associated with CAG repeat expansions in the gene, CACNA1A. Our recent evidence suggests that the disease is attributable to expression of a polyQ repeat expansion within a second CACNA1A gene product, a1ACT, that normally serves as a transcription factor (TF) critical for cerebellar cortical development, and that arises through the action of a cryptic cellular internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) within the coding region. SCA6-sized polyQ expansions in the ?1ACT TF interrupt its cellular and molecular function, cause cell death in vitro, ataxia and cortical thinning. The long-term goal of this project is to understand te pathogenesis of SCA6 by characterizing how a1ACTSCA6 alters gene expression, by confirming the role of the CACNA1A IRES in vivo and by developing a screening strategy for potential IRES-inhibiting compounds as potential therapies. Specifically we propose to ask: 1. Does the SCA6 polyQ expansion in a1ACT in the transcription factor (a1ACTSCA6) changes the gene binding patterns and the expression patterns of Purkinje cell genes? We will utilize chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to analyze in detail binding profiles of a1ACTWT and a1ACTSCA6 expressed in PC12 cells and isolate RNA from Purkinje cells of mice expressing a1ACTWT or a1ACTSCA6 to generate global gene expression profiles by RNA-seq to correlate a1ACTWT-DNA binding with transcriptional activity and to identify allele-specific changes in gene expression patterns. 2. Does a1ACT expression by CACNA1A IRES and promoter reproduce the normal and pathological functions of ?1ACT? We will generate new lines of a1ACT transgenic mice that will only yield a1ACTWT or a1ACTSCA6 protein by CAP-independent translation, and use the tet-off expression system to drive conditional expression and use a CACNA1A-tTA transgene to generate an endogenous pattern of expression. 3. Can we identify IRES-directed molecules that selectively suppress ?1ACT translation, but not a1A subunit expression? We will use our dual-luciferase bicistronic reporter to determine the optimal RNA sequences involved in IRES function, identify the ITAFs by EMSA and predict the secondary structure of CACNA1A IRES. We will carry out a high throughput screening assay to identify compounds that interfere with ?1ACT IRES function."
"9571466","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A range of potential solutions has been proposed to the confidentiality challenges in genome research and how best to proceed in this era of big data is not known. Some advocate measures to further restrict access to genomic information. Others argue for strengthening laws that prohibit misuse. In the meantime, the strengths and weaknesses of the current web of protections created by federal and state law are poorly understood. In addition, emerging models are breaking from tradition by ceding control to participants over whether, with whom, and for what purposes their data are shared. There is an urgent need to better understand the existing constellation of legal protections, how they apply to a swiftly evolving research environment, and how best to inform prospective participants about the extent and limitations of these protections in different contexts. The objective of the proposed research is to gather empirical data regarding the actual scope of the confidentiality protections applicable to genome research (beyond basic security measures), as well as how these are and should be described to prospective participants. To achieve this objective, we will: (1) Conduct in-depth qualitative interviews to explore a diverse group of thought leaders' views of risks and confidentiality protections in genome research; (2) Carry out extensive analysis of the legal tools for protecting confidentiality in genome research (e.g., genetic anti-discriminatio laws, data sharing policies and regulations), including their application to realistic research scenarios encompassing both current and evolving approaches to control over data sharing; and (3) Develop flexible model language that simply and accurately describes the confidentiality risks and protections in genome research, and gather feedback on the language from thought leaders and research participants. The conduct of these aims will be highly integrated, with each one informing and being informed by the others. The expected outcome will be an extensive body of complementary, high quality data concerning the strengths and limitations of legal means to protect confidentiality in genome research-including in the context of emerging approaches to control over data sharing-and how the risks and protections both are and should be described to prospective participants. These data will further support several important areas of future research, including investigation of participant opinions and understanding, genome researcher perspectives, and rigorous empirical assessment of our model consent language."
"9617131","Project Summary We propose to develop and test a novel noninvasive neuromodulation technique integrating transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) with electrophysiological source imaging (ESI) to allow real-time evidence-based neuromodulation with spatio-temporal precision for brain research and managing brain conditions. Despite the recent developments and attention surrounding tFUS, relatively little is known about the mechanisms and optimal parameters of this stimulation technology. The addition of simultaneous functional neuroimaging, aimed at providing biomarkers to assess the effects of tFUS neuromodulation, could provide crucial information regarding the neural response to the applied stimulation in real-time. In order for tFUS to be further developed and transformed into a robust neuromodulation technology, an integrated ESI-guided tFUS system to allow for individualized and responsive stimulation is urgently needed. Our hypothesis is that the integrated dense array EEG and tFUS system will provide important neural data to quantify and optimize stimulation effects in real- time. We further propose to develop a novel acousto-modulated ESI technique to significantly improve the spatial precision allowing for quantifying brain activity induced by tFUS. This proposed integration promises to result in a high spatiotemporal resolution neuromodulation system capable of being applied in a closed-loop and subject-specific manner. To achieve the proposed goal, we will address the following specific aims. Aim 1A. We will develop an ESI-tFUS system and validate the proposed methods in a rat model with simultaneous extracellular recordings of neural spikes and LFP activities. ESI will be performed from the scalp potential distribution and head anatomy to be obtained by structure imaging, and used to assess and optimize tFUS parameters and stimulation strategy. Aim 1B. We will develop an acousto-modulated ESI-tFUS system and validate the proposed methods in a rat model with simultaneous extracellular recordings of neural spikes and LFP activities. tFUS-induced brain activity will be monitored and imaged using the high spatial resolution acousto-modulated ESI, and used to assess and optimize tFUS parameters and stimulation strategy. Aim 2. We will develop an ESI (including acousto-modulated ESI) guided tFUS system for human use with real-time imaging capability. We hypothesize that the ESI-guided tFUS will provide real-time quantitative neural measures to be used to directly adjust tFUS parameters and strategy, allowing for optimization of tFUS stimulation. We will conduct online experiments in motor and somatosensory paradigms to test the merits of the proposed ESI-guided tFUS neuromodulation. The successful completion of the proposed research promises to develop a transformative technique for noninvasive neuromodulation with high spatio-temporal precision, individualized for each subject and responsive to dynamic neural activity recorded from the brain."
"9417437","PROGRAM SUMMARY Mechanical ventilation, a life-saving intervention in critically ill patients with respiratory failure due to acute res- piratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also creates excessive mechanical stress that augments lung injury, a syndrome known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The pathobiology of VILI and ARDS share many in- flammatory features including increases in lung vascular permeability due to loss of endothelial cell (EC) barri- er integrity. Insights into VILI pathobiology have been incremental with no viable therapies realized. This PPG intensely focuses on increasing our understanding of: i) the transcription factors that relay the effects of exces- sive mechanical stress; ii) the molecular signaling pathways that lead to EC injury, including initial activation of a mechanosensitive Ca2+-regulatory receptor, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4); iii) post translational modifications (PTMs) that influence key signaling pathways involved in VILI re- sponses; iv) genetic and epigenetic influences in key target genes involved in VILI responses; and v) novel therapeutic strategies for VILI. The key novel genes that comprise the focus of each Project were identified by our genomic?intensive approaches and selected for their capacity to contribute to a spectrum of VILI respons- es from VILI-induced lung inflammation, increased vascular permeability and injury (Projects #1 and #2); to VILI resolution with restoration of lung vascular barrier integrity (Project #3). These strategies are integrated across our three PPG projects and represent the thematic underpinnings of this PPG. Studies will be conduct- ed by an outstanding group of gifted and interactive translational scientists. Project #1 will examine the NF-?B- dependent mechanisms (including protein nitration) by which VILI downregulates expression of SOX18, a criti- cal lung vascular barrier-protective transcription factor (TF), and the key tight junction protein, claudin 5. The influence of the mechanosensitive receptor, TRPV4 on mitochondrial ROS and mechanical stress-associated TFs such as HIF2? will be explored. Project #2 will extend novel insights regarding the critical role of secreted extracellular NAMPT (eNAMPT), a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, in VILI and ARDS. Excessive me- chanical stress induces NAMPT expression and eNAMPT ligates TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) to induce NF-?B signaling and inflammatory lung injury. Project #2 will interrogate novel mechanisms of NAMPT secretion, the influence of NAMPT/TLR4 SNPs, and NAMPT and TLR4 as therapeutic targets. Project #3 will interrogate ge- netic and epigenetic regulation of mechanical stress-mediated sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor expression (S1PR1, S1PR3) and the role of VILI-induced nitration of Rac1 and RhoA GTPases in lung vascular barrier regulation. The synergy derived from the interaction between individual Projects, as well as with our scientific Cores, with enviable expertise in molecular biology (B), genetic epidemiology (B), pre-clinical models of dis- ease (C), and protein chemistry & Biophyics (D), will advance our programmatic approaches and promote the development of novel, individualized therapies to attenuate VILI especially in populations at risk for ARDS."
"9414614","TR&D2 PROJECT SUMMARY  Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are  naturally occurring polydisperse linear polysaccharides that are heavily O- and N-sulfated. The interaction  between GAGs and proteins are critical for many biological processes including cell-cell and cell-matrix  interactions, cell migration and proliferation, growth factor sequestration, chemokine and cytokine activation,  microbial recognition and tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. Hundreds of HS-binding  proteins have been identified, but the oligosaccharide structure that mediates a particular interaction has been  defined in only a few cases due to the structural complexity of HS. In this Technology Research and  Development (TR&D2) project, three teams of investigators, representing skills in the areas of nuclear  magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and computational biology, will work cooperatively to  develop new technologies for the structural characterization of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-protein complexes  and protein-protein complexes that are induced by the presence of GAGs. Their efforts will be guided by the  needs of driving biomedical projects (DBPs) that span systems related to cell migration, cell signaling, and the  maintenance of cellular integrity. These projects share complexities in the size of the systems involved, the  heterogeneity of the interacting GAGs, and the post-translational modification of the proteins. These  complexities dictate the development of novel technologies, often in cooperation with other TR&D groups of  this Research Resource. Specific Aims include: Aim 1. Developing NMR Approaches to Protein-GAG and  Protein-Protein Complexes including approaches for identification of bound ligand geometries and interaction  motifs and approaches for characterization of protein-protein and GAG-protein complexes, Aim 2. Developing  Hydroxyl Radical Protein Footprinting (HRPF) for the structural characterization of Protein-GAG  Complexes including technology to improve the sequence coverage of high spatial resolution HRPF,  development of HRPF technologies for the analysis of protein-GAG interaction interfaces, and development of  HRPF technologies for the analysis of protein-protein interaction interfaces, Aim 3. Developing Computer  Modeling approaches for GAGs, Proteoglycans, and GAG-Protein complexes, including optimizing  docking algorithms for use with GAGs, adapting the GLYCAM force field and develop suitable protocols to  improve energy representation of GAGs"
"9415409","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects 5.2 million Americans and over 75% of AF patients are 65 years or older. Weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. Older AF patients are at highest risk for stroke and major bleeding, often curtailing prescription of AC. Therapy for AF has also become more complex in recent years with the introduction of target specific oral anticoagulants beyond warfarin. In the proposed Systematic Assessment of Geriatric Elements in Atrial Fibrillation (SAGE-AF) study, our overall objective is to enhance AC decision-making in older patients with AF by assessing previously neglected information that is part of a geriatric assessment (e.g., cognitive function, fall risk) and identifying its key elements amenable to administration in the clinic and associated with important AC outcomes (e.g., bleeding, time in therapeutic range [TTR], patient-reported AC satisfaction). We will conduct geriatric assessments every 6 months for 2 years in a diverse sample of 1,200 older AF patients at high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc?2) recruited from 5 ambulatory clinics in Central MA and GA. The specific Aims of the proposed project are: 1. Relate components of a geriatric assessment, based on validated measures of psychosocial and cognitive function and frailty, to use and type of AC, and compare how elements of the geriatric assessment change over time in AC users and non-users. 2. Among AF patients receiving AC, relate geriatric assessment measures at baseline to indicators of successful AC (e.g., bleeding, TTR, and patient satisfaction), 3. Among AF patients receiving AC, relate change in geriatric assessment measures to indicators of successful AC (bleeding, TTR and patient satisfaction) and evaluate whether this association varies by AC type. Our findings will contribute important information on novel and parsimonious risk stratifiers for optimal anticoagulation and clinical and quality of life outcomes in older patients with AF. We will also disseminate our results in a novel and user-friendly was by preparing a concise, easy to use geriatric AF resource based on our results that is comprised of key geriatric elements, all of which will be freely available in the public domain, and instructions for administration and interpretation. This Geriatric AF Resource will accelerate the uptake of our findings and enhance the clinical impact of SAGE-AF."
"9560418","Abstract As much as 90% of HIV-1 infections occur by transmission at mucosal surfaces. Combating the earliest events in viral entry is one strategy to combat HIV infection, since it is thought that fewer virions successfully infect the host at mucosal surfaces. Vaccines that also stimulate the systemic immune system are also needed to control HIV spread once the mucosal barrier is breached. Systemic immunization by the intramuscular route can drive mucosal immune responses, but there is also data showing that mucosal immunization may better educate responses that can act at these first sites of mucosal HIV entry. We performed vaccine route comparison studies in rhesus macaques that showed that vaginal mucosal vaccination reduced SHIV-SF162P3 viral loads better than intramuscular immunization. We more recently we performed an immunogenicity study that compared the effects of vaccine routes using new replicating single- cycle adenoviruses (SC-Ads) boosted with recombinant gp140 env. Animals immunized by only the intramuscular route had lower final SHIV neutralizing antibodies in their plasma than animals immunized by intranasal alone or intranasal and intramuscular vaccinations. Intramuscular animals had high T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in the blood, but low Tfh in lymph nodes. Conversely, animals immunized by the intranasal route had high Tfh in lymph nodes, but low Tfh in the blood. Animals immunized by the intramuscular route had lower antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activities than animals immunized by the mucosal intranasal route. These data suggest that the route of priming and boosting with gene-based and protein vaccines may markedly affect the quality and quantity of systemic and mucosal immune responses against HIV. In this project, we will build on these interesting vaccine route observations in a team consisting of groups from Mayo Clinic, MD Anderson, and the Oregon Health & Science University. We will combine our new SC-Ad vaccines with promising SOSIP protein vaccines and deliver these by a more potent synchronous co- immunization strategy. We will test how systemic vs. mucosal vaccination drives different systemic and mucosal immune responses with key analyses of effects on mucosal cell trafficking, Tfh production, and the production of functional antibodies in systemic and mucosal compartments. We will pursue these efforts in the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Optimize synchronous vaccine strategies that utilize multiple routes of immunizations to achieve potent systemic and mucosal humoral and cellular responses. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the protective efficacy and immune correlates of synchronous systemic and mucosal vaccination against repeated low dose mucosal challenge by clade C SHIV in rhesus macaques."
"9413382","Project Summary While mitochondrial dysfunction is evident in the failing heart, its precise role in disease progression is unclear and the mechanism(s) of its origin is not well understood. Mitochondria play a key role in many cellular processes, including oxidative phosphorylation, metabolite synthesis and calcium storage. They are also important regulators of cell death and monitor changes in the intracellular environment such as presence of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage. The BCL-2 proteins play a key role in regulating mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. We recently discovered that the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein MCL-1 is critical for normal mitochondrial function and cardiac homeostasis. Loss of MCL-1 in cardiac myocytes leads to rapid mitochondrial dysfunction, development of heart failure, and early mortality. Surprisingly, MCL-1 deficient myocytes display signs of necrosis rather than apoptosis as would be expected, suggesting that besides its anti- apoptotic role, MCL-1 has an essential but yet unidentified role in maintaining mitochondrial function in cardiac myocytes. We have also found that MCL-1 exists both in the outer mitochondrial membrane (MCL-1OM) and in the mitochondrial matrix (MCL-1Matrix) in the heart. While a study has implicated MCL-1OM in regulating apoptosis, the function of MCL-1Matrix is still unknown. Based on our preliminary data, we propose to study the hypothesis that MCL-1 has a dual role in maintaining cardiac mitochondrial function and health that is dependent on its mitochondrial location: MCL-1OM facilitates mitochondrial fission and mitophagy of aberrant mitochondria to prevent activation of unnecessary apoptosis, whereas MCL-1Matrix promotes mitochondrial fusion to preserve bioenergetic capacity and protect against autophagosomal degradation during nutrient limiting conditions. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the role of MCL-1Matrix in regulating mitochondrial fusion, function, turnover and survival. In Specific Aim 2, we will delineate the role of MCL-1OM in regulating mitochondrial fission and turnover. We will determine if MCL-1OM interacts with Drp1 to promote asymmetrical fission and removal of damaged mitochondria and whether this is part of its pro-survival function. Finally, in Specific Aim #3, we will investigate whether MCL-1OM also functions as a receptor for LC3 to drive selective degradation of mitochondrial by autophagosomes. We will utilize both isolated cardiac myocytes and genetically modified mouse models combined with proteomics, cell and molecular biology to uncover the bi- functional roles of MCL-1OM and MCL-1Matrix in myocytes under baseline conditions and in response to challenge (fasting and myocardial infarction). These studies will provide important new insights into the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics, turnover and survival in the heart. A better understanding of how mitochondrial function is regulated in the heart under normal and disease conditions such as myocardial infarct will contribute towards future clinical management of heart disease. "
"9594015","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Most bacterial pathogenesis studies have focused on mono-culture infections; however, it is clear that many bacterial infections are not simply the result of colonization with a single species, but rather ensue from the action of polymicrobial communities. Microbes within polymicrobial infections often display synergistic interactions that result in enhanced colonization and persistence in the infection site. Such interactions have been particularly noted in infections of the oral cavity, although the molecular processes controlling these synergistic interactions are generally not known. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidating the polymicrobial interactions necessary for enhanced persistence in vivo is critical for a comprehensive understanding of synergy, and a necessary first step towards developing therapeutics to treat polymicrobial infections. The overall goal of this research plan is to examine, from a mechanistic standpoint, how interactions between oral bacteria impact community development and in vivo persistence. To accomplish this goal, high-throughput genomics techniques will be employed to identify microbial virulence genes that are uniquely expressed during co-infection and/or required for polymicrobial synergy."
"9546066","PROJECT SUMMARY The worldwide adoption of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) has been instrumental in halving the global burden of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria since the early 2000s. Malaria?s impact nonetheless remains vast, with over 400,000 yearly deaths in Africa alone. Now, Pf resistance to ACTs threatens to overwhelm malaria control efforts. Treatment failure rates with the ACT dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine (PPQ) currently exceed 50% in Cambodia, and resistance to other ACTs has been observed elsewhere in Asia. The emergence and spread of ACT resistance in Africa would be calamitous. Studies have identified core roles for the Pf chloroquine resistance transporter PfCRT and the multidrug resistance transporter PfMDR1 in modulating Pf susceptibility to the ACT partner drugs PPQ, amodiaquine (ADQ), pyronaridine (PND), lumefantrine (LMF) and mefloquine (MFQ). These studies include our recent gene editing-based finding that novel PfCRT mutations present in Cambodia can confer PPQ resistance. By analyzing a dataset of >2,500 Pf genomes sampled across Asia and Africa, we now find a plethora of new sequence variants of both genes. In Aim 1, we will apply gene editing techniques coupled with comprehensive drug susceptibility profiling to test the hypothesis that these novel PfCRT mutations have been selected to mediate ACT partner drug resistance. In Asia, we predict that these variants primarily affect susceptibility to PPQ, LMF, or MFQ. In Africa, we observe a predominance of previously uncharacterized haplotypes, and will characterize whether these variants mediate reduced susceptibility to partner drugs and/or minimize fitness costs. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that current ACTs are selecting for novel mutations in PfMDR1 throughout Asia and Africa. Based on our recent discovery of a role for PfMDR1 as a mediator of gametocyte resistance to antimalarials, we will also assess whether mutant PfMDR1 isoforms can enhance the transmission of drug-resistant Pf parasites. In Aim 3, we propose to identify antimalarial combinations that exert opposing selective pressures on PfCRT and PfMDR1 and thus preclude the acquisition of multidrug resistance. Using selection methods with mutant pfcrt and pfmdr1 lines, our studies will experimentally address the premise of two ongoing triple ACT clinical trials in Cambodia, which are testing the dual partner drug combinations LMF+ADQ and PPQ+MFQ as approaches to effectively treat drug-resistant malaria and prevent its further evolution and spread. In Aim 4, we will use cell- based assays to test the hypothesis that hemoglobin endocytosis and subsequent processing in the Pf digestive vacuole are key aspects of the modes of action of most ACT drugs, whose potency can be impacted by mutant isoforms of PfMDR1 or PfCRT. This proposal, which aligns with the NIAID priority of supporting research on antimicrobial drug resistance, will transform our understanding of ACT partner drug resistance and modes of action, provide new biomarkers, and identify strategies to effectively treat drug-resistant Pf malaria."
"9416129","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."
"9419914","PROJECT ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Unfortunately, there are significant CRC screening disparities that result in higher rates of CRC-related morbidity and mortality for minority and rural patient populations, particularly in the southern United States. The development of interventions that capitalize on advances in communication, informatics, and computer science have great promise for resolving theoretical and practical problems associated with CRC screening decision-making. The purpose of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a patient-centered, tailored message intervention delivered via virtual technology for increasing CRC screening within guidelines among racial/ethnic minority and rural patients. We hypothesize that exposure to a minimally tailored CRC screening intervention delivered via VHT will lead to improved cognitive processing of the intervention and increased adherence with initial and repeated annual FIT screening completion as compared to a fully tailored, text-only intervention. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups and think-aloud interviews stratified by geography, gender, and racial/ethnic background to expand and pilot test an intervention that uses a virtual human as a delivery mechanism for CRC screening information. In Specific Aim 2, patients (N = 3,000) will be recruited via primary care clinics and a secure, clinical data warehouse to complete a patient- randomized test of the efficacy of the intervention for promoting initial and repeat FIT testing. Dependent measures will be assessed via patient self-report and chart review. The proposed study will reduce health disparities and associated morbidity and mortality due to CRC via increasing screening among racial/ethnic minority and rural populations."
"9411127","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondrial diseases are common and devastating conditions with an extremely poor prognosis. Gene therapies have been proposed involving allotopic expression of recoded mitochondrial genes from the nucleus, however, the viability of such an approach remains controversial. We have discovered that the major technical hurdles to such an approach that limit the development of a novel gene therapy are competition from the endogenous mutant protein in the complex and the hydrophobicity of these proteins. We have discovered a novel mitochondrial translation inhibition (TLI) approach to prevent expression of the mutant protein within mitochondria. We propose to test the combination of mitochondrial TLI with a novel therapy approach that targets coding RNAs to mitochondria. Such an approach directly addresses both technical hurdles using novel and previously untested methods. Any serious investigation aimed at developing a novel mitochondrial gene therapy would require a well-characterized, pathogenic, endogenous mitochondrial mutation in an amenable genetic system where feasibility can be demonstrated and optimized in vivo. We propose a rigorous test of mitochondrial TLI and mitochondrial-targeted RNA expression using several biochemical and phenotypic assays of function in a well-characterized animal model system."
"9448165","Project Summary/Abstract A fraction of germinal center-derived B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (~12% of Burkitt lymphomas, ~9% of Diffuse Large B cell lymphomas, up to 36% of relapsed Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma cases) carry recurrent missense mutations in FOXO1, a member of the Fox-O family of Forkhead transcription factors. FOXO1 controls critical stage transitions during B cell development, and is a main target of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which relays key survival signals downstream of the B cell receptor. While FOXO1 is inactivated and thus classically regarded as a tumor suppressor in diverse cancer types and in animal models, lymphoma- associated FOXO1 mutations are predicted instead to lock FOXO1 in a constitutively active state by rendering it insensitive to PI3K-dependent nuclear export and degradation. In a recent study we found that FOXO1 is critical for the maintenance of specific B cell fate programs required for the control of zonal polarity in the germinal center. Consistently, FOXO1 null germinal centers fail to support some key biological functions that are typically associated to zonal polarity, including affinity maturation and class-switch recombination. This project seeks to understand how lymphoma-associated mutations impact FOXO1 activities in germinal center B cells, and how these events may contribute to the pathogenesis of germinal center-derived B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We propose that FOXO1 mutations actively contribute to B cell lymphomagenesis by altering the control of germinal center polarity and B cell responses to specific immune signals. To test this idea, we will develop the following specific aims: 1) Investigate how FOXO1 mutations alter B cell responses driven by stress-activated protein kinase pathways, combining in vitro and in vivo chemical genetics strategies in normal, cancerous germinal center B cells to measure and manipulate FOXO1 responses to these specific pathways; with further validation through the analysis of primary B-NHL cases; 2) Determine the impact of FOXO1 mutations on germinal center B-cell homeostasis, by engineering germinal center B cells with specific missense mutations in order to evaluate their effects on germinal center polarity and the control of germinal center-specific FOXO1 transcriptional programs; 3) Evaluate the role of FOXO1 mutations in the pathogenesis of MYC-driven B-cell lymphomas, by using adoptive transfer strategies to mimic in vivo the genetics of a fraction (~12%) of Burkitt lymphomas in which MYC deregulation and FOXO1 mutations coexist. Given the role of FOXO1 in normal germinal center physiology, the results of this study are expected to provide direct insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of germinal center-derived B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These studies are likely to be clinically relevant because of the growing interest on PI3K inhibitors as therapeutic agents in this group of malignancies."
"9440156","The overall objective of the Cell Function Analysis Core at the University of Washington Diabetes Research Center is to provide affiliates with analyses of glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function and intracellular signaling to support research of diabetes, obesity and related disorders. To achieve this goal, the Core aims to: (1) Provide real time functional analysis using in vitro flow culture systems of tissues/cells; (2) Provide in vivo assessments of metabolic phenotypes in rodent models important in diabetes research; (3) Provide static assessment of cellular metabolism and function; (4) Harvest, isolate and culture primary tissue from rodents, including islets and islet cells, liver, retina and brain, for subsequent morphological and functional characterization, as well as to procure human islets for the same purposes; (5) Offer training and consultation to affiliates, their trainees and staff; and (6) Develop new analytical tools requested by affiliates to support their studies of the metabolic regulation of cell function as it relates to research in diabetes, obesity and related disorders.  Since inception of the Core in 2002, in vitro analysis has been the major focus. Cell and tissue types that have been analyzed include islets, retina, skeletal muscle, stem cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, adipocytes, endothelial cells, neuronal cells and liver/hepatocytes. Recently, in vivo services have been added to combine both the detailed and mechanistic analyses provided in cell and tissue studies with the ability to test the roles of identified processes in whole body settings. Whole animal studies currently offered include glucose and insulin tolerance tests, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, islet transplantation and collection of lymph. Expansion of new in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo services has allowed the Core to better serve the needs of the Center's research base. As diabetes affects metabolism and signaling in many cell types, the services of the Cell Function Analysis Core continue to be of great value to many Center affiliate investigators. The Core plans to continue to provide users with systematic and integrated approaches to the analysis of cell types that are critically involved in diabetes and its complications, obesity and related disorders."
"9537097","Project Summary  Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and has historically been reported to cause mild symptomatic diseases and neurological syndromes during human infections. More recently, the explosion of microcephaly among infants born to ZIKV-infected women has made ZIKV a global public health concern. Apart from reports of sexual and congenital transmission, ZIKV is primarily transmitted by certain infected species of Aedes mosquitoes. In the absence of a vaccine or an approved antiviral drug, vector control strategies remain the only mechanism for control of Zika infections. While ZIKV causes acute human diseases, infections of vector mosquitoes are basically non-pathogenic, allowing persistent infections and conferring lifelong ability to transmit the virus. However, the mechanisms of establishment and maintenance of persistent infections in mosquitoes are unclear. In addition, vertical transmission of flaviviruses, which plays an unknown role in maintaining the virus in nature during adverse conditions, is poorly understood. The objective of this application is to elucidate the mechanisms of persistent infections in mosquitoes, with the ultimate goal of developing new strategies for transmission interventions. Research over the past several years on various mosquito-borne viruses has indicated that the different outcomes of arboviral infections in humans and mosquitoes are due to differences in the innate-immune responses between the two hosts. ZIKV, like most arboviruses, contains RNA as its genetic material, and several studies have suggested that the RNA- interference (RNAi) defense pathway is a major antiviral defense mechanism in mosquitoes. Nevertheless, it is unclear how ZIKV evades the robust RNAi response to establish persistent infections. Recent published studies have indicated that DNA forms of several arboviral RNA genomes are generated following infection in mosquito cell cultures and in mosquitoes, and small RNAs (sRNAs) deriving from viral DNAs (vDNAs) reinforce the RNAi response against viral infections. The proposed work tests a hypothesis that upon infection, vDNA in somatic cells aids to establish and maintain persistent infections, whereas vDNA in germline cells restricts virus replication. The Specific Aims are to determine I) the role of vDNA in ZIKV replication using mosquito cell cultures, and II) the role of vDNA in ZIKV replication in germline cells. Mosquito cell lines Aag and U4.4 from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, respectively, will be used for Aim I and colonized populations of both species will be used for Aim II. The results of these studies are expected to shed light on mosquito-virus interactions and lead to the development of new vector-control strategies. For example, it may be possible to develop strategies to stop the transition from acute to persistent infections in mosquitoes and/or to eliminate the infected mosquitoes from the population."

"9404052","Abstract. The cell adhesion receptor integrin ?V?8 is important for vascular and cardiac morphogenesis, lung epithelial homeostasis, CNS development, immune function, and latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) activation. Ligand binding and integrin activation are coupled in most integrins to two distinct, large conformational changes: extension at the bent integrin knees and opening of the ligand-binding headpiece. Thus, most integrins can equilibrate between two low affinity conformations, bent-closed and extended-closed, and a high affinity extended-open conformation. However, integrin ?V?8 is atypical because it is constitutively extended and resistant to ligand-induced headpiece opening. Moreover, the ?8 cytoplasmic domain lacks binding motifs for the cytoskeletal adaptors talin and kindlin, but binds a distinct cytoskeletal protein associated with lung adenocarcinoma, DAL-1. We will structurally and functionally characterize ?V?8 to determine the molecular mechanisms that govern its atypical behavior. In Aim 1, we obtain an overview of ?V?8 ectodomain and headpiece conformational states compared to ?V?6 by EM. We investigate whether binding of pro-TGF-?1 or a crossreacting, de novo designed ?V?6-binding protein (?V?6-BP) induces headpiece opening of ?V?8. We mutationally examine whether divergent sequences in ?8 metal-binding sites or in the ?I-hybrid interface stabilize the closed headpiece and whether divergent sequence at the ?-knee stabilizes the extended conformation. In Aim 2, we obtain crystal structures of the ?V?8 headpiece, its complexes with peptide ligand, pro-TGF-?1, or ?V?6-BP and a structure of the ?V?8 ectodomain. Structures will demonstrate how ?V?8 resists ligand-induced headpiece opening and maintains constitutive extension. In Aim 3, we investigate affinity and functional regulation of ?V?8 and transition to developing a potential therapeutic. We characterize the structure of the ?8 cytoplasmic domain bound to DAL-1 and investigate the role of this interaction in ?V?8-mediated activation of latent pro-TGF-?1. We hypothesize that in vivo, the ?V?8 headpiece may be opened by inside-out signaling, and increase affinity for ligand. To establish whether headpiece opening of ?V?8 increases affinity, we will use mutations to release restraints on ?V?8 headpiece opening, measure their effect on affinity for ligand, and correlate increases in affinity with headpiece opening measured by EM. Structures of ?V?8 bound to current, highly potent ?V?6 and ?V?8 small molecule antagonists will explain their limited selectivity for ?V?6 and ?V?8. The insights obtained will guide development of second generation, highly selective, pure antagonist therapeutics to treat diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  "
"9616345","The Xpert MTB/RIF assay, an automated, integrated nucleic acid amplification diagnostic test, has been a major breakthrough in tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics. Yet, large proportions of TB suspects are placed on TB treatment based on empirical decision-making even in settings where Xpert MTB/RIF is available. Empirical TB treatment decisions can be problematic, resulting both in under-treatment and in over-treatment. A major driver of empirical TB treatment is Xpert MTB/RIF?s modest sensitivity in smear-negative pulmonary TB patients ? Xpert MTB/RIF detects only about one-half to two-thirds of such patients. A TB test with exceedingly high sensitivity and negative predictive value would substantially increase clinicians? confidence in a negative test result and thereby shift therapeutic decision making away from empiricism and towards a microbiological evidence-based approach. To maximize the individual and population level impact of rapid TB diagnostics, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay has been re-engineered to substantially increase test sensitivity, as demonstrated by preliminary data. The proposed research will establish the clinical diagnostic accuracy of the new Ultra test in adults with signs/symptoms of pulmonary TB, and will provide information about the potential impact of Ultra-based diagnostic algorithms on individual and public health. Project aims are 1) to determine the clinical diagnostic accuracy of the Ultra test for detection of M. tuberculosis in sputum; 2) to refine estimates of Ultra specificity for detection of rifampin resistance; and 3) to characterize short-term participant outcomes including initiation of treatment and to model the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of TB diagnosis using Ultra. Two hypotheses will be tested with regard to TB case detection ? first, that Ultra sensitivity is superior to that of Xpert MTB/RIF in adults with smear-negative/culture-confirmed pulmonary TB; and second, that the sensitivity of a single Ultra test is non-inferior to that of a single liquid culture in adults with pulmonary TB. To accomplish these aims, a multi-site clinical diagnostic accuracy study will be conducted in Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil. This study will incorporate a robust gold standard of multiple sputum cultures at the time of a participant?s enrollment; an observational component comprised of follow-up over two months will allow characterization of treatment initiation patterns and collection of parameter estimates for mathematical models. This proposal will extend an ongoing early phase Ultra accuracy study currently being performed by the DMID/TB-Clinical Diagnostics Research Consortium in the same settings, and thereby accrue sufficient participants to test these novel hypotheses in a step-wise technology evaluation process that is seamless and efficient. Study results are expected to form the evidence base for World Health Organization policy guidance; a finding that Ultra sensitivity is non-inferior to that of a liquid culture test could transform TB diagnostic algorithms and clinical care."

"9485464","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery ? whole- cell screening of compound collections ? has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics."
"9414597","PROJECT SUMMARY: Vertebrate photoreceptors are an elegant example of form being finely tuned to support function. These primary sensory neurons are linearly organized into a series of morphologically and functionally distinct compartments. All of the compartments contribute in different ways to the maintenance and signaling activity of this neuron. For instance, photons are captured in the outer segment, the synapse communicates that event to downstream neurons, and the inner segment, typically thought of as the housekeeping compartment, houses the ion channels, pumps, and transporters needed to set and maintain the circulating current that is ultimately used to communicate the presence or absence of light. The polarized trafficking of select ion channels to the different photoreceptor compartments is well recognized as essential for the health and function of this cell. Yet, the mechanisms controlling the subcellular trafficking and localization of ion channels in this cell or for that matter, most others, is poorly understood at best. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms that control polarized protein trafficking in photoreceptors. In this proposal we are building on the knowledge we gained in our earlier studies of HCN1, a hyperpolarization activated channel that filters light responses and is essential for vision in bright light. Aim 1 probes how the assembly status and permissiveness of HCN1 to leave the ER is coordinated. This aim also tests if the mechanisms controlling HCN1 processing are used to regulate Kv2.1/Kv8.2, a related ion channel also found within the inner segment that when absent results in aberrant signaling and cone dystrophy. Aim 2 probes the function and mechanism of a second trafficking signal within HCN1 that we propose is required, at least in part, to recruit the protein coat needed for the generation of HCN1-bearing transport vesicles. A suite of genetic, biochemical, imaging, and physiological tools are used. Altogether, this work will reveal fundamental mechanisms used in the polarized trafficking of photoreceptor proteins, shed light on the contributions made by the early secretory pathway to the regulation of ion channels, and is anticipated to transform current views of the fundamental organization of photoreceptors in health and disease."
"9427508","PROJECT SUMMARY Placebo response is an important and poorly understood phenomenon of treatment response. A large and variable placebo response has been evident in decade?s long placebo-controlled double blind clinical trials that tested various treatments for alcohol use disorders (AUD). Large placebo effects complicate detection of quantifiable treatment effects for investigational medications, especially for the modestly effective psychiatric drugs. Placebo response arise from a complex interaction of patient, clinical trial staff, and treatment environment factors. Because the placebo response is intricate, complex and variable among individuals, it is challenging to identify these individuals prior to enrollment in a clinical trial. The proposed project seeks to explore the utility of genomics to identify placebo responders in phase ?? AUD treatment trials. To date, to the best of our knowledge, comprehensive genomic studies have not been conducted to assess genetic variation in relation to outcomes of AUD treatment or placebo response. Genomic analyses require large sample sizes that are not easy to gather in small to medium scale clinical trials conducted with treatment seeking individuals with an AUD or other drug use disorder. To address this issue, we will leverage the resources from six completed and two ongoing NIAAA-funded phase ?? AUD treatment trials. We will first examine changes in patterns of drinking among the enrolled treatment-seeking individuals with AUD, during treatment with a placebo (Aim ?). We will then explore how these changes in drinking affect expression of genes, perusing the entire genome of each individual (Aim ??). The genes whose expression levels are found to be changed according to a person?s drinking behavior or how frequent the person was able to abstain from alcohol, will be fine- combed to identify DNA sequence (genetic) variations that rendered them susceptible to varying amounts of alcohol (Aim ???). Next, we will explore whether these genetic variations and the expression patterns of their genes, can predict placebo response (as measured by abstinence rates) in populations with AUD together with other psychiatric conditions (cocaine addiction and PTSD; Exploratory Aim ?). Finally, we will explore whether the identified genetic variants and genes are expressed in the same manner in those who have received an active medication (ondansetron/topiramate/naltrexone) for the treatment of their AUD (Exploratory Aim ??), which may help us understand the placebo component embedded within response to an active medication, at a molecular level. In summary, our proposed project is conceptually and methodologically innovative in exploring genetic variations by examining gene expression differences associated with amounts of drinking during placebo treatment. As the first study to characterize genomics of placebo response in phase ?? AUD trials, findings will provide a wealth of information for future translational research and propagate personalized medicine. Harnessing the placebo response and knowing how to optimize it will allow us to: a) improve overall outcomes; b) determine who is in need of additional treatment, and c) characterize the therapeutic index (efficacy/side effects) for particular subgroups with AUD."
"9522674","Summary The long-term goal of this research project is to understand cellular, molecular, and epigenetic mechanisms of endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling that may modulate synaptic and neurocognitive functions. While the eCB system is known to play an important role in regulation of brain homeostasis, accumulated information suggests that the eCB system is also involved in several mental and neurological disorders. Augmentation of eCB signaling by inhibition of eCB metabolism has been proposed as a promising therapy for treatment and prevention of mental and neurocognitive illnesses. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying augmentation of eCB signaling by chronic inhibition of eCB metabolism in synaptic activity is still limited. Strengthening endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) signaling by chronic inactivation of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary enzyme that hydrolyzes 2-AG in the brain, has been shown to produce antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects and enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory. Our recent studies showed that sustained inactivation of MAGL increases the density of dendritic spines and expression of glutamate receptor subunits in the hippocampus. This suggests that augmentation of 2-AG signaling by inhibition of MAGL regulates structural and functional plasticity of synapses that determine activity of neural circuits and corresponding neurocognitive functions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate expression and function of target molecules. However, we do not know whether miRNAs that target molecules involved in maintaining the integrity of synaptic structure and function are regulated by eCB signaling. In the proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis that regulation of synaptic activity and cognitive function by chronic inactivation of MAGL is through 2-AG signaling-mediated suppression of the miRNA that targets the molecules important for regulation of synaptic activity. The research proposed in this application is expected to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying augmentation of eCB signaling in regulation of synaptic and neurocognitive functions, which may lead to future research on improving strategies for the treatment and prevention of mental and neurological illnesses."
"9607175","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Working memory is the ability to hold items ?in mind?. It is at the core of cognition, providing the workspace for complex behaviors. However, despite its critical nature, working memory is surprisingly limited: holding 3-4 items at a time. To compensate for this limited capacity, working memory is dynamically controlled: access to working memory is tightly regulated and representations in working memory are selectively manipulated. Disrupting one?s ability to control working memory can be pathological; such disruptions are believed to be a core cognitive deficit in schizophrenia1 and may underlie intrusive thoughts in anxiety2 and depression3. To develop novel, mechanistically-informed, treatments for these diseases, we must first develop a detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms that control working memory. We propose to investigate three ways in which working memory is controlled: First, one must be able to control access to working memory. A ?gating? signal is thought to provide this control: to-be-remembered stimuli are gated into memory; to-be-ignored stimuli are not. Our first aim will distinguish hypotheses on the source of this gating signal; we will leverage our novel many-electrode recording techniques in non-human primates to test how interactions between prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia gate representations into memory. In addition, we will test the prediction that gating changes the temporal dynamics of sensory representations in order to maintain them in memory. Second, once a set of items are in working memory, one must be able to select a specific item in order to use it to guide behavior. This process is akin to attention, which selects specific external stimuli. Our second aim will use our many-electrode recording techniques to a) discover the neural mechanisms that control selection from working memory and b) test hypotheses that relate these mechanisms to those that control attention. Third, when remembering multiple stimuli, one must judiciously allocate the limited resource of working memory amongst them: stimuli with greater behavioral relevance should be more accurately remembered. Our third aim will determine how neurons in prefrontal and parietal cortex control the prioritization of items in working memory and how this prioritization impacts working memory representations throughout prefrontal, parietal, and sensory cortices. While our proposed research is basic in nature, we believe it is an important first step in a mechanistic understanding of the core cognitive deficits of several mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and anxiety. Our hope is that this understanding will improve mental health by leading to new diagnostics and treatments for cognitive disorders. In particular, we hope to use our results to develop physiological markers that will improve detection, allow for earlier intervention, and guide targeted treatments. Our long-term goal is to develop a cognitive prosthetic that combines electrophysiology and stimulation to treat neuropsychiatric diseases."

"9473243","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unwanted immune responses by mast cells contribute to the symptoms of allergies and asthma. In the proposed research we seek to harness members of the Siglec family of inhibitory receptors to suppress allergen mediated IgE dependent activation and degranulation of human mast cells, and desensitize them to subsequent antigen challenge. To this end we will employ Siglec tolerizing allergenic liposomes (STALs) that display both an allergen and synthetic high affinity glycan ligand of a Siglec expressed on mast cells. When STALs encounter a mast cell pre-sensitized with an allergen specific IgE bound to the high affinity IgE receptor ?RI), the glycan ligand will recruit the inhibitory Siglec to the immunological synapse. While liposomes with antigen alone will powerfully activate the cells, the glycan ligand on STALs is hypothesized to recruit the inhibitory Siglec and dampen or suppress activation and degranulation. In this project we will focus on two Siglecs on human mast cells, namely CD33 and Siglec-8. We will assess the impact of STALs for desensitizing human mast cells in models of passive cutaneous and passive systemic anaphylaxis using transgenic mice with mast cells expressing a human Siglec (Siglec-8 and CD33) and a human Fc?RI receptor, and humanized mice engrafted with human CD34+ stem cells that populate the mouse with human mast cells. A portion of our effort will also be devoted to improving the specificity of the synthetic ligand for Siglec-8 and develop a novel ligand for the Siglec-6 receptor, a mast cell target for Project 1.

"9357639","ABSTRACT Pompe disease is an inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid ?- glucosidase, which results in progressive phrenic neuropathology. Since available enzyme replacement therapy does not treat this neuropathology, diaphragm/phrenic neuromuscular dysfunction ultimately leads to ventilatory insufficiency and ventilator dependence. Consequently, respiratory complications are the leading cause of mortality in Pompe disease. Diaphragm pacing is an alternative approach to treat critical ventilatory insufficiency, activating phrenic axons through intramuscular electrodes. Exciting preliminary data from patients with Pompe disease who have undergone diaphragm pacing suggests it may do more than replace the need for mechanical ventilation. It may have a rehabilitative effect on diaphragm/phrenic activity, restoring some independence from ventilatory support of any kind. While these initial findings are encouraging, pacing-induced neuromuscular plasticity has scarcely been studied. The fundamental hypothesis guiding this proposal is that diaphragm pacing is a novel rehabilitative tool to increase diaphragm/phrenic activity, thereby improving the capacity for independent tidal volume generation. In this way, diaphragm pacing may promote ventilator weaning in Pompe disease. We will recruit patients with Pompe disease who have undergone intramuscular pacemaker implantation to replace chronic mechanical ventilation, and then evaluate the rehabilitative effects of pacing over 12 weeks on diaphragm/phrenic neuromuscular activity and recovery of independent breathing ability. During spontaneous breathing and maximal voluntary efforts, we will investigate pacing effects on breathing function. In addition, direct recordings of human diaphragm EMG activity using an innovative application of the diaphragm intramuscular electrodes will enable longitudinal evaluations of diaphragm/phrenic activity. To test our central hypothesis, we propose two specific aims: 1) test the hypothesis that a single bout of diaphragm pacing has lasting effects on diaphragm/phrenic activation and ventilation, and 2) test the hypothesis that these effects accumulate over 12 weeks of repeated, daily diaphragm pacing sessions. This high risk/high impact proposal will evaluate diaphragm pacing as a rehabilitative tool to increase diaphragm/phrenic activity and improve independent breathing ability. This work will provide the first controlled, empirical evidence concerning the ability of diaphragm pacing to rehabilitate phrenic neuromuscular function in Pompe disease, and may have profound implications for the use of diaphragm stimulation in other clinical disorders that compromise breathing. Our hope is that data generated in this study will form the basis for a future mechanistic study of diaphragm pacing to promote ventilator weaning in neuromuscular disease."
"9405541","ABSTRACT We can see things in three dimensions (3D) because the visual system reconstructs the 3D configuration of objects from their two-dimensional images projected onto the retina. Previous studies have described loss of 3D binocular vision and constructional apraxia after parietal lesions, although the neurophysiology of this effect remains poorly understood. Furthermore, many studies have characterized the neural basis of binocular disparity processing, although few have dealt with the representation of 3D object orientation and how this is maintained invariant in the world. In the proposed studies we will examine neural selectivity for 3D planar orientation in the caudal intraparietal area (CIP), visual posterior sylvian (VPS) and area V3A of macaque monkeys. We employ a multi-faceted approach, combining neural recordings, behavior, population decoding and chemical inactivation. We will directly test the role of each of these areas in slant discrimination by first recording and then manipulating neural activity while macaques perform a fine slant discrimination task. Neural firing rates will be analyzed using signal detection theory and we will quantify neuronal variability by measuring noise correlations and choice probabilities. We will also probe for causal links between neurons in these areas and slant orientation perception by employing reversible inactivation. Furthermore, it has been known that gravity plays a critical role in shaping our visual experience of the world, influencing both sensory perception and motor planning, but surprisingly little is known about where and how the brain may use a neural estimate of gravity to transform visual signals from retinal to an allocentric representation. The proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that the transformation occurs progressively, beginning with an egocentric representation in V3A (CIP's main visual input) and culminating in a primarily gravity-centered representation: V3A (egocentric) ? CIP ? VPS (mostly gravity-centered). Finally, we will test earth-vertical slant orientation perception in animals after bilateral labyrinthectomy to monitor deficits in visual orientation perception, both acutely and after recovery from peripheral vestibular lesion. We hypothesize acute deficits, but also a functional recovery as the role of proprioceptive signals increases. This research is important for understanding multisensory visual?vestibular influences on 3D vision in a 3D world."
"9465292","PROJECT SUMMARY NETosis was identified as a distinct mode of cell death in neutrophils more than a decade ago. Dysregulation of NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of human pathologies such as preeclampsia, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, cystic fibrosis, lupus nephritis, and coagulopathies that include cancer-associated thrombosis. The literature consistently cites the lack of a standardized methodology for quantitation of NETosis as an impediment to basic and translational research. Thus, the premise is that there is a compelling, unmet need for a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis to accelerate neutrophil and inflammation-based research and facilitate the discovery and development of therapeutic compounds. The scope of this STTR project is to develop a high-throughput image analysis and quantitation method by using high content imaging and the revolutionary technology of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the identification and quantitation of NETosis in human neutrophils. The target readout is based on the primary morphological difference between NETotic and non-NETotic nuclei--the decondensation of chromatin. This image-based quantitative method will be observer-independent and will enable robust and rapid evaluation of a large number of samples that would exceed any attempts at manual assessment. In Phase I we will complete the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Optimize and standardize the high- throughput platform for quantitation of NETosis in adherent human neutrophils. This includes standard assay optimization procedures, training the CNN to identify and quantitate NETotic neutrophil, and demonstrating that the CNN reliably distinguishes between necrosis and NETosis, whose phenotypes appear similar to the human eye. Aim 2: Validate the NETosis assay biochemically and clinically. This includes concentration-response assays with NETosis agonists, assessment of NETosis inhibitors, and evaluation of the NETotic status of Sickle Cell Disease patient samples (a disease in which aberrant NETosis has been implicated). The expected outcome of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate proof-of-concept for this automated high- throughput NETosis assay. Further, we expect to provide insight into the utility of the assay for assessment of inhibitors of NETosis as therapeutic agents. Upon completion of our Phase I aims, our Phase II program will focus on further optimizing and validating this NETosis assay and preparing it for commercialization.  "
"9513849","Research Strategy: Describe how undergraduate and/or graduate students will be exposed to and supervised conducting hands-on research. Describe how students will participate in research activities such as planning, execution and/or analysis of research. Formal training plans (e.g., non-research activities, didactic training, seminars) should not be provided. A sound rationale should be offered as to why the approach and the research team, including undergraduate and/or graduate students, are appropriate to accomplish the specific aims and to make an important scientific contribution. Drs. Stephens and Hess have developed a 10 week laboratory module, piloted in Spring quarter of 2017, that will expose dozens of students to hypothesis-driven science utilizing whole-genomic sequencing and multidimensional phenotypic data. This portion of the supported research will have the broadest impact on student research and is detailed in multiple sections of the grant including the Introduction to the Resubmission and the Main Proposal. Santa Clara University Department of Biology does not have a graduate program, thus our research groups consist of the P.I., undergraduate researchers and a lab technician when the lab is funded extramurally. Both Dr. Stephens and Hess have a proven track record of recruiting motivated undergraduate students to collect and analyze primary data in both public health and genomics. We each have several undergraduate student co- authors, including first authors, on peer-reviewed manuscripts. We will continue to recruit and train undergraduate researchers using our methods that have proved successful. Importantly these extramural funds will provide our labs with a lab technician. This position is critical to act as primary point of contact for undergraduate researchers, especially during the academic year when the P.I.s have significant teaching responsibilities. We have recruited for these positions from amongst our best graduating research students and have had excellent success in this regard. Recent technicians supported by extramural grants used those positions to further their career paths. Lab technicians supported by previous RUI grants to Stephens have included Lisandra West (who subsequently received her Ph.D. from Stanford University in 2012), Kelly Watanabe (PharmD, UCSF, 2011), Amanda Lieu (M.D., Tufts University, 2014), and Cindy Dick (currently working on her Ph.D. at UC Irvine). In the Hess lab technicians supported by previous grants have included Cindy Dick (currently working on her Ph.D. at UC Irvine), Kiana Espinosa (currently working on her M.D. at Loyola University Chicago), Jillian Gerrity (accepted to medical school at UCSD, working for the non- profit Amigos de Jesus in Honduras) and Farid Tadros (accepted to medical school at Albert Einstein Medical School)."
"9545262","Project Summary  Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a major global health problem and development of new interventions requires better understanding of the biological mechanisms used by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to cause infection. Mtb must continuously sense and respond its host environment during infection, and cyclic nucleotides are a critical part of this response in Mtb. Cyclic 3',5'-AMP (cAMP) is a universal signal molecule used by both microbial pathogens and their mammalian hosts to sense and respond to environmental cues. cAMP plays central roles in both bacterial virulence gene regulation and modulation of host response by several major bacterial pathogens, including Mtb. cAMP is produced by adenylyl cyclases and degraded by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) to maintain signaling pathway sensitivity and specificity. Mtb encodes numerous adenylyl cyclases and cAMP-binding effector proteins but only one cAMP PDE (Rv0805) has been identified. Preliminary data indicate that Rv0805 is required for Mtb persistence in a murine model of infection, but its mechanism remains unclear. In addition to hydrolyzing cAMP, Rv0805 has robust activity against 2',3'-cAMP and 2',3'-cGMP, which are products of RNA cleavage, and it has been shown to stabilize cell wall function and regulate gene expression on a global level through unknown mechanisms that may not require cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis. The scientific premise for this proposal is that Rv0805 is a multifunctional protein that contributes to TB pathogenesis, but the importance of RV0805's specific activities for Mtb biology, including virulence, are not known. We hypothesize that Rv0805 has important roles in Mtb biology beyond cAMP hydrolysis that may include both gene regulatory and RNA damage responses. Major goals of this proposal are to determine the importance of Rv0805's catalytic activities for Mtb-host interactions, gene regulation and cAMP homeostasis while establishing whether Rv0805 has the potential to engage in RNA repair. This information will provide a critical basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying Rv0805's role in Mtb biology, particularly during infection."
"9466779","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) are a major cause of bloodstream infections in the hospital and in the community. Indeed, MRSA remains the second leading cause of mortality by drug-resistant bacterial pathogens in the USA. Although two mechanistically novel antibiotic classes exist to treat such infections (Daptomycin; DAP and Linezolid; LZD), their use in the clinic for nearly two decades has not reversed this trend. Moreover, DAP and LZD possess significant limitations; the former is solely IV-administered in a clinical setting, which significantly increases health care costs, and the latter, although delivered by IV and PO, can cause serious adverse effects, including myelosuppression following extended use, and resistance has emerged. The introduction of tedizolid is not likely to thwart LZD resistance since it shares the LZD target. Conversely, ?-lactam antibiotics have historically served as the most impactful class of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections but their efficacy has been eroded by the emergence of MRSA/E. Reestablishing ?- lactams as a standard of care therapy for Gram-positive bacterial infections including MRSA/E would provide clinicians a new therapeutic option addressing these issues and offer an antibiotic stewardship strategy to mitigate resistance to DAP and LZD. In recently published work, we have demonstrated that the Wall Teichoic Acid (WTA) biosynthetic pathway is rich in ? -lactam potentiation targets. Building upon a solid foundation of preliminary data, our Aims are: Aim 1 (Phase 1; Ph1). Focused discovery effort to identify compounds with potency and pharmacokinetics (PK) superior to tarocin A2, for oral combination with dicloxacillin (DCX) or IV combination with imipenem (IPM). Aim 2 (Phase 2; Ph2). Expansion of SAR and detailed characterization of hit compounds. Aim 3 (Ph2). Advancement of at least two compounds from Aim 2 through in vivo efficacy testing to identify lead candidates."
"9528865","PROJECT SUMMARY Low- and middle-income countries are projected to have substantial increases in incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the same regions where tuberculosis (TB) is endemic and a public health priority. Diabetes increases the risk of TB disease by three times and an estimated 15% of incident TB cases are due to diabetes, similar to the proportion of TB cases attributable to HIV. In the context of increasing rates of co-occurring TB and diabetes, prevention efforts to reduce the burden of dual disease are severely limited by critical gaps in knowledge of the relationship between latent TB infection and risk of diabetes mellitus. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) determine the extent to which latent TB infection (measured by interferon-gamma release assay [IGRA]) increases the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus; (2) determine if latent TB increases the risk of progression from normal blood glucose to pre-diabetes; and (3) determine the extent to which latent TB treatment decreases the risk of incident type 2 diabetes among patients with latent TB infection. The aims of this project will be achieved by building a large database of patients with known latent TB infection status who are at risk of developing diabetes. The study will use longitudinal data from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse from 2000-2015 to build a retrospective cohort of more than 100,000 patients. The analysis will include multiple modeling strategies and propensity scores to assess the relationship between latent TB infection and rate of incident diabetes. This research has the potential to have far-reaching implications for biomedical approaches to diabetes prevention and TB control. The proposed study includes an unprecedented hypothesis that challenges current assumptions and the paradigm that the observed association between active TB and diabetes is singularly due to increased susceptibility to TB among patients with diabetes. Existing epidemiologic data demonstrate a higher prevalence of diabetes in patients with active TB compared to the background population prevalence of diabetes. However, it is unknown if the increased prevalence of diabetes among patients with active TB is due to diabetes impacting 1) risk of latent infection, 2) risk of reactivation from latent TB to active disease, 3) risk for primary progression from Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure to active TB disease, 4) or alternatively, if TB infection or disease impacts the risk of diabetes incidence. The proposed study will help to clarify TB-diabetes pathways and will generate preliminary data useful to deconstruct the pathways which lead to increased diabetes prevalence among patients with active TB. The long term goal of the proposed work is to prepare for a prospective study to examine the relationship between TB infection and risk of diabetes and ultimately better characterize the effect of immune activity related to TB infection on metabolic function."
"9619148","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses a neglected major problem: no effective primary prevention for anthracycline- based chemotherapeutic (Anth-bC) myocardial injury experienced during and after treatment for triple negative (estrogen, progesterone, HER-2 receptor negative) breast cancer. Today, cardiovascular (CV) events including heart failure due to myocardial injury and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction are the second leading cause of mortality in women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. We provide preliminary data indicating that myocardial injury and LV dysfunction occur early upon receipt of Anth-bC (1 to 6 months), and additional data suggesting that treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (or statins) prevents cardiac dysfunction during receipt of Anth-bC. Accordingly, we propose to conduct a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial of 40 mg per day of atorvastatin in women receiving Anth-bC for triple negative breast cancer. Our primary outcomes are acquired with an innovative form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that identifies LV dysfunction after initiation of Anth-bC. We will collect these MRI measures along with other questionnaire derived and serum measures that will provide understanding of the mechanisms by which statin therapy influences LV function. We will also monitor for the potential occurrence of side effects related to the administration of statins including diabetes, cognitive decline, myalgias and creatine kinase elevations. The study will be conducted at 6 referral sites within North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida using a permuted block enrollment design with emphasis on recruiting minority subjects. We have assembled an accomplished group of investigators with experience in the conduct of trials of patients with cancer, the administration of statins and assessing CV-related outcomes, and the utilization of innovative MRI and serum biomarkers to identify CV abnormalities in heart failure patients. Uniquely, this NHLBI proposed multi-center study will combine with efforts from the National Cancer Institute supported Wake Forest Research Base Clinical Community Oncology Program. This collaboration is attractive as it combines the investigative strengths of the NHLBI to ascertain CV disease with the existing funding from the NCI to conduct randomized clinical trials in women with breast cancer. Throughout the document, color is used to enhance the readability of Figures and Tables, and many of the additional details regarding conduct of a clinical trial are indexed within the proposal in Table 2 of the scientific plan. This study represents the first clinical trial of primary prevention to avod CV injury in women treated for breast cancer using a low-cost, widely available generic therapy. If successful, this trial will suggest a new paradigm in the management of breast cancer patients using primary prevention to attenuate the cardiotoxic effects from Anth-bC for the purpose of improving the overall long-term survival of women with breast cancer."
"9640607","President Barack Obama was delivering on a promise made in his State of the Union Address when he  officially launched the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), igniting intensive work by Dr. Francis Collins and the PMI Working Group this year. The promise is bold: nothing less than truly revolutionizing the way we develop therapies and treatments for patients across America. With the PMI, we can credibly claim that we will improve health outcomes for all.  Achieving this vision will require the efforts of numerous healthcare stakeholders. Because the PMI has the promise to solve our most intractable health problems by harnessing the power of data, success requires recruiting individuals willing to share their personal information. These volunteers ? the 1 million Americans who will comprise the PMI Cohort Program (PMI-CP) ? are the pillars upon which the PMI will stand. The volunteers will need to understand the goals of the PMI, the logistics of what volunteering means and the specifics of why sharing their personal health data and biospecimens will benefit the health of future generations. With the right communications strategy, cohort volunteers will not only understand their individual importance to this cause, they will also be actively enthusiastic, and assist in the recruitment of additional volunteers from their communities.  This is a proposal to help accomplish this feat through a multi- faceted campaign with a suite of outreach strategies designed to find, educate, and activate a cohort that is representative of the diversity of our country. It will require communications strategies that reach many thousands at a time, as well as multiple targeted, personalized micro-strategies. Messaging is at the core of achieving buy-in and making participation a matter of personal, community, and civic pride. As bold and large as the PMI is, recruiting the cohort comes down to the individual.  Garnering this level of buy-in will require a team with expertise in not only communications and patient advocacy, but also with a record of achieving the level of trust needed to connect with individuals in a meaningful way and the ability to motivate them to take action. The team must have the ability to speak across cultures, ethnicities, and socio-economic statuses. We have assembled that team. And we would be honored to make the PMI vision a reality."
"9414607","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary Overall objective of the Resource for Integrated Glycotechnology is to develop novel, integrated technologies and multidisciplinary approaches to solve key problems in glycobiology. Protein-carbohydrate interactions play critical roles in numerous biological recognition events at the cell surface and extracellular matrix. The focus of our studies are proteoglycans (PGs), where extended, linear, charged glycan polymers are attached to cell surface or secreted proteins that contribute to cell-cell, cell-macromolecule,  and cell-matrix interactions and influence numerous biological functions. Studies on protein-PG interactions are a prototype for  more generalized studies on protein-carbohydrate interactions. Despite the critical importance of PGs in diverse biological processes, very little is known about the details of PG interactions with  binding partners or their mechanisms of biological function. As a result, PG-protein interactions are a major technical frontier for contemporary biology. We will address the challenges of PG structures, interactions, and biological functions by leveraging advances in analytical, synthetic,  structural, biochemical and biological tools. Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects will be applied to the study of several Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) that will act as a test beds for the utility of the integrated approaches and provide feedback for new challenges that will spur further technology development. As the technologies mature they will be applied to a collection of Collaborative Projects and use in Analytical Services (C&S) that will  also extend the utility of the technologies to a broader scientific community. Multiple strategies for Dissemination will increase awareness and access to the technology developments and our Training courses (D&T) will provide  direct opportunities for researchers to learn the latest technology developments from Resource staff. The proposal aims to develop technologies (TR&Ds) to advance the goals of the DBPs through ligand identification and validation using PG fragment enrichment approaches, MS-based sequencing and composition analysis, and chemical glycan oligomer synthesis and array generation. Structures of PG-protein complexes will be determined using novel NMR methods and oxidative footprinting approaches and computational methods will predict and validate structure models. Biochemical targets will be generated in large quantities with isotopic labels and further modified to contain paramagnetic tags as needed to facilitate NMR studies. PG core proteins containing engineered glycan polymers will be generated using recombinant expression and cell systems harboring enhanced or mutant PG biosynthetic machinery. Mutant cell lines will also be used to characterize biological functions of PGs in appropriate biological contexts. The combined technology developments will advance our understanding of these critical glycan polymer structures and provide insights into their roles in human physiology and disease."
"9554248","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the most prevalent inflammatory diseases in the U.S., affecting up to 16% of the population and substantially diminishing the quality of life and productivity of patients. In four years, the annual U.S. health care expenditure to treat patients with CRS dramatically increased from $9B to $64B (5% of the health care budget), with a corresponding rise in surgical treatment for those 20% of patients who fail current medical management. Despite these staggering statistics, CRS remains an under-researched epidemic with limited effective treatment options. GlycoMira?s lead candidate, GM-1111, is a synthetic glycosaminoglycan that inhibits multiple inflammatory mediators and more specifically, targets Toll-like receptor 2-mediated signaling. Moreover, topical intranasal administration of GM-1111 effectively reduces chronic sinonasal inflammation in mice. Animals treated with GM-1111 showed significant reductions in degenerative histologic changes, inflammatory cell infiltration, goblet cell hyperplasia, and cytokine gene expression within the sinonasal tissues. Herein, GM-1111 will be further developed and validated as a commercially viable and effective therapy for CRS. In Aim 1, the optimal dosing regimen and degree to which GM-1111 effectively treats CRS will be determined by testing a wide range of doses and dosing frequencies in animal models of CRS. The efficacy of GM-1111 will be compared to healthy, inflammatory, and therapeutic controls by analyzing the clinical signs, histologic changes, and inflammatory tissue biomarkers associated with CRS. In Aim 2, the potential mucolytic properties of GM-1111 will be investigated, and the effect of GM-1111 on ciliary function will be determined. Increased mucus production and impaired mucociliary clearance are central to the pathogenesis of CRS and elevate the risk of opportunistic pathogen infection. Based on mechanistic evidence with a similar glycosaminoglycan, topically administered GM-1111 should penetrate mucus and reduce sinonasal inflammation. To test this hypothesis, the effects of GM-1111 on artificial mucus with known mucin and bacterial composition, nasal secretions from patients with CRS, and ciliary function using sinonasal tissue from controls and patients with CRS will be investigated. The efficiency of GM-1111 to penetrate mucus and tissue to effectively reduce sinonasal inflammation will then be determined in an animal model of CRS characterized by a robust mucus response. These studies will provide crucial preclinical data supporting GM- 1111 as a commercially viable and effective therapeutic for treating the millions of patients affected by this debilitating disease."
"9526272","Project Summary  A key mechanism for immune evasion and persistent infection by the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is recombination at the vls locus. To date, the vls locus has not been receptive to direct mutation by any available methods. This fact has created the need for the development of a vls system that is amenable to genetic manipulation. Recently, our lab has generated a mini-vls plasmid construct with high potential to meet this demand. Development of this mini-vls system as a tool for mutational analysis will help bridge a fundamental gap in our understanding of the mechanism behind vlsE antigenic variation. Our long-term goals are to determine the mechanistic aspects of vlsE recombination, and to identify and characterize the unique B. burgdorferi proteins responsible for VlsE antigenic variation. The objective of this application is to identify the mechanistic determinants required for vls switching, and to establish the importance of the cis organization of the vls locus for efficient recombination. The central hypothesis is that that G-run DNA regions directly flanking the vlsE variable cassette, and the 51bp inverted repeat of the vls locus, act as mechanistic DNA elements that are essential for vlsE switching. Furthermore, we hypothesize that antigenic variation requires a cis organization of the locus. The rationale for the proposed research is that identifying key mechanistic elements and important structural components will ultimately provide critical clues to the proteins involved in vls recombination that is critical for persistent infection by the Lyme disease pathogen. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to that part of NIH?s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will potentially help to reduce the burdens of human illness and disability. Guided by preliminary data and cited work by other groups, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Identify the mechanistic determinants required for vls recombination; and 2) Establish the importance of the cis organization of the vls locus for efficient vlsE recombination. Under the first aim, mutations of the DNA inverted repeat and G-run regions within the vls locus will be generated and cloned into an lp28-1-deficient strain of B. burgdorferi using a unique mini-vls plasmid, and transformants will be used to infect both immunologically-competent and -deficient mice. Under the second aim, spirochetes harboring the vlsE gene and silent cassettes on two separate linear DNA molecules will be examined for vls switching after being passaged through a mouse host. The proposed work is innovative for two main reasons: 1) they entail cloning and genetic manipulation of the full vls locus using a unique mini-vls construct, and 2) they involve transformation of ligated DNA products directly into B. burgdorferi. When applied, the results from the proposed studies are expected to allow the targeting of this system in order to significantly reduce the ability of this pathogen to establish a persistent infection in the mammalian host."
"9543164","Project Summary/Abstract This grant request is for the third ?Emerging Issues in Cochlear Implantation? conference organized by the non-profit American Cochlear Implant Alliance (ACIA) to be held March 8-10, 2018 in Washington, DC. The first two such conferences were held in October 2013 and 2015; both were supported by NIH R13 Conference Grants. The timeframe for this conference has been moved from Fall to early Spring to avoid conflicts with Fall meetings that some clinicians regularly attend. Conference attendance will span scientists and clinicians from across the cochlear implant (CI) continuum of care including otolaryngologists, audiologists, speech pathologists, psychologists, and others on CI teams. Secondary audiences for these topics include health insurance plan representatives and Federal and state employees including CMS, Tricare, and the VA. The emerging issues format allows an in-depth look at topics needing greater exploration and clinical guidance to advance the field. With CI candidacy expansion, there is a need to address ways to appropriately serve new recipients as well as previously implanted individuals who require care throughout their lifetime. In the pediatric realm, for children who are prelingually deaf and identified at birth, there is a need for parents to be counseled as to how to support their CI child?s language development at an earlier age than has been typical in the past. Recent research supports pediatric CI at 12 months of age or less. The ACIA Board of Directors selected four topics determined to be particularly important to CI outcomes and access in the immediate future?topics that have not been thoroughly explored in a clinical research context specific to cochlear implant care. These themes, as well as submitted podium and poster talks, will provide timely research and clinical insights. The topics are consistent with feedback that ACIA has received from its members via conference surveys and other contacts. The four Emerging Issues are: (1) Parental Engagement in Pediatric CI Outcomes, (2) Quality of Life Associated with Cochlear Implantation, (3) Cochlear Implant Practice Management: Maximizing Value for Optimal Delivery of Care, and (4) CI Candidacy in 2018. In addition, attendees may submit abstracts to present papers or posters on related topics during the afternoon each day and on Saturday morning. Students are encouraged to submit poster presentations and there will be an opportunity for selected poster presenters to give brief (3 minute) podium highlight talks, a format that was used successfully at the 2017 San Francisco pediatric meeting. The Board Chair is the overall Conference Chair while the PI is the conference Co-Chair. Emerging Issues Chairs were selected by the Board for their specialized expertise in the topics. The Chairs then determined program focus. These individuals were drawn from universities and other clinical settings from around the country and serve as the Conference Organizing Committee. Invited speakers are from wide-spread clinical settings (university, private or non-profit clinic, hospital), and diverse geographic areas. Proceedings will be developed and published online open access to encourage the widest possible distribution to varied audiences."
"9635032","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis), prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are important public health problems as they are highly prevalent and their treatment is both difficult and expensive. Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and periodontal disease are known to be strongly correlated. A large body of evidence suggests these correlations are causal and bidirectional. While diabetes is a generally well- accepted risk factor for the development of periodontal disease, classical bidirectional hypotheses only suggest periodontal disease to contribute to poor glycemic control among patients with established diabetes. However, in this proposal we hypothesize that dysbiotic subgingival microbial communities common in periodontal disease (i.e., periodontal infections) might contribute to insulin resistance and future development of prediabetes among initially diabetes-free individuals. Recent work by our group and others provides strong support for this hypothesis. Nevertheless, several limitations exist limiting causal inference and obscuring future research directions. First, temporality is unclear due to cross-sectional designs. Second, no study to date has comprehensively assessed the subgingival microbiome as it relates to prediabetes. Third, the potential role of inflammation as a mediator of associations between subgingival microbiota and prediabetes has not been examined in longitudinal studies. We will enroll and follow longitudinally 1,400 diabetes-free individuals to examine the co-evolution of the subgingival microbiome and the development of prediabetes. This will allow us to test hypotheses about the potentially bidirectional association between periodontal infection and impaired glucose regulation early in the natural history of both disease processes and well before the development of overt diabetes. This investigation will also generate important knowledge necessary for optimizing the design of future intervention studies. Specifically, future RCT designs will be optimized by knowledge about microbial community characteristics and inflammatory phenotypes associated with prediabetes risk, to ensure that susceptible individuals are enrolled and anti-infective treatment goals are achieved."
"9438509","ABSTRACT  The goals of this Coordinating Center include facilitating information exchange among investigators in the NCI Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Consortium, supporting data integration and data analysis, and serving as a central resource for characterization and distribution of model systems. The leadership of this Center consists of a trio of investigators with deep and long-standing research programs focused on SCLC, with complementary strengths and experience. Charles Rudin, an experienced laboratory and clinical researcher focused on SCLC, who has directed two of the largest lung cancer research programs in the country over the past 13 years, serves as the overall PI of the Center, providing administrative leadership and coordination. John Minna and Tyler Jacks serve as co-leaders of the Center. Dr. Minna has consistently and repeatedly led discovery efforts defining SCLC biology over several decades, and together with his collaborators established nearly all of the SCLC cell lines that have served as the basis for SCLC preclinical research. Dr. Jacks has extensive experience in the development and characterization of innovative genetically engineered mouse models of SCLC and over the past decades has served as the primary mentor of many of the active investigators around the world working on mouse models of SCLC. We bring together additional key investigators and unqiue resources that we believe substantially add to the strengths of the Center. Yu Shir at Vanderbilt has established and directs HIPAA-compliant databases used by several multi- investigator consortia. Nikolaus Schultz?s team developed the cBioPortal and continues to expand and improve this leading platform for analysis and integration of complex ?omic level data, supporting many multi- investigator consortia worldwide. Adi Gazdar oversees the cell line resource at UT Southwestern, and will support distribution of these lines to U01 SCLC investigators. Anna Farago and Jeff Engelman at MGH, together with John Poirier and Dr. Rudin at MSK, have established substantial resources of SCLC patient- derived xenografts (PDX) and circulating tumor cell-derived xenografts (CDX) models, which are available for distribution among consortium members. Scott Lowe and Andrea Ventura offer highly innovative genetically engineered mouse modeling by CRISPR/Cas9 modulation of embryonic stem cells to rapidly assess genetic contributors to SCLC biology. Afshin Dowlati at Case Western will contribute a large collection of clinically annotated SCLC tissue microarrays representing chemosensitive as well as primary and secondary chemoresistant disease. Together we represent an exceptional team, led by three of the most widely recognized and established investigators in SCLC discovery research, with complementary strengths in therapeutic translation, basic biology, and animal modeling. By providing the resources above, and by coordinating frequent data-sharing opportunities and leading annual face-to-face meetings among SCLC investigators, we believe this Center can substantially accellerate progress against this deadly disease."
"9469656","Sarcomere gene mutations cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common devastating disease. HCM is characterized by cardiac/myocyte hypertrophy, myocyte disarray, fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmias and risk of sudden cardiac death. While HCM may progress to heart failure, sudden death can occur before heart failure develops. While an enormous amount of knowledge of genetics and molecular mechanisms of cardiomyocyte dysfunction has been gained from animal models of HCM, very little is known regarding the roles of cardiac innervation and its interactions with the cardiac renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in HCM. We hypothesize that pathological remodeling of the heart, and cardiomyocyte energy depletion in HCM induces dysregulation of cardiac sensory nerve activity leading to cardiac sympathovagal imbalance, activation of cardiac RAS, and decreased baroreflex sensitivity, all of which promote arrhythmias and accelerate progression to congestive heart failure and death. We will utilize two established mouse models of HCM with cardiac-targeted human mutations and differing phenotypes to test our hypothesis. Specific Aims of the project are to: (1) Determine roles of cardiac vagal and ?sympathetic? afferent nerves, and arterial baroreflex in mediating autonomic and cardiac dysfunction in HCM mice, and (2) Test the hypothesis that chronic infusion of the angiotensin peptide Ang-(1-7) to HCM mice will inhibit cardiac sympathetic tone and oppose deleterious actions of angiotensin II, resulting in less cardiac fibrosis and improved left ventricular (LV) function. Experimental approaches include telemetric monitoring of blood pressure, assessment of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, and baroreflex sensitivity; assessment of cardiac function by echocardiograph, and LV pressure recordings; and chemical ablation of cardiac ?sympathetic? afferent neurons. Additionally, the angiotensin peptide Ang-(1-7) will be infused chronically to inhibit the cardiac RAS and sympathetic nerve activity for therapeutic benefit. The significance of this research relates to understanding the key roles played by cardiac sensory and sympathetic nerves, baroreflexes, and cardiac RAS in determining the severity of HCM and its progression to heart failure. In addition, a novel treatment [Ang-(1-7) infusion] for HCM will be tested with potential clinical implications."
"9446363","The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights."
"9473244","Inflammation is resolved, in part, by cell surface signaling molecules on leukocytes that have extracellular ligand binding domains linked to intracellular immune inhibitory domains. Among these are members of the siglec family that have ITIM and ITSM inhibitory sequences on their short intracellular domains that are actuated when they bind, with high specificity, to extracellular sialoglycans (siglec ligands) expressed on inflammatory target tissues. Project 3 is based on the hypothesis that endogenous human siglec ligands are multivalent sialoglycans produced by inflammatory target tissues including airway, skin and intestine. In terms of allergic inflammation, Siglec-8 is expressed on human eosinophils, whereas CD33 (Siglec-3), Siglec-6 and Siglec-8 are expressed by mast cells. When siglecs on these granulocytes encounter their sialoglycan ligands, inflammation is halted; engagement of Siglec-8 on eosinophils results in their apoptosis whereas engagement of siglecs on mast cells inhibits immune mediator release. We propose that identification of immune inhibitory sialoglycan structures and knowledge of how their expression is regulated in health and disease will provide new insights into the molecular basis of immune regulation and perhaps new targets for therapeutic intervention in human allergic inflammation.  Three aims are proposed to accomplish these goals. Aim 1 is based on our finding that Siglec-8 ligands on human airway are robustly expressed in submucosal glands and ducts, and that these ligands are secreted onto the airway mucus layer. This aim will compare Siglec-8 sialoglycan ligands in mucus secretions from inflamed and non-inflamed human airways, revealing quantitative as well as qualitative (protein carrier, glycan structure) information. Our studies on airway Siglec-8 ligands will be extended to other human tissues subject to allergic inflammation, using healthy and inflamed human skin and GI tract. Tissue distributions and molecular characteristics of Siglec-8 ligands will be compared among these tissues. Aim 2 will explore the glycan structures required for optimal Siglec-8 engagement on eosinophils and mast cells. Based on our finding that specifically sulfated and sialylated keratan sulfate chains are responsible for Siglec-8 binding on human airways, we will use chemoenzymatic methods to generate modified glycan structures to test for binding requirements. We will create multivalent forms of these ligands to functionally engage Siglec-8 on human eosinophils and mast cells. The knowledge gained will be used to identify glycan biosynthetic enzymes that, when transfected into human submucosal gland cell lines, result in expression of Siglec-8 ligands. Concurrently, in Aim 3, we will apply the technologies we established to identify Siglec-8 ligands to the search for endogenous human ligands for CD33 and Siglec-6. Through these aims we anticipate significantly enhancing our understanding of glycans involved in regulating allergic inflammation and their expression in health and disease."
"9415418","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human eye sends information to the brain at an estimated rate of about 10 megabits per second, roughly the speed of an ethernet connection. Processing such a large bandwidth stream of visual information on behaviorally relevant time scales requires that neurons extract and represent information from visual signals efficiently, i.e represent the most information for the least cost in time and energy. In essence, the brain needs to compress the visual stream much the same way software compresses the digital representation of a movie. Little is known about how the brain accomplishes this critical task. We propose to investigate the neural mechanisms that extrastriate visual cortex uses to encode motion information in single neurons, populations, and in pursuit eye movement behavior. Neurons in area MT respond selectively to visual motion and provide the visual inputs for smooth pursuit eye movements. By recording neural and behavioral responses together, we can determine not only how cortical neurons compress incoming visual signals to represent them efficiently but also whether those coding strategies are important for behavioral performance. We will build on that paradigm to study how MT neurons jointly encode motion information, guided by recent work in the retina demonstrating enhanced stimulus compression by neural populations. The general aim of the proposed research is to determine how dynamic visual motion stimuli are represented in a cortical neuronal population and how efficiently that sensory information is subsequently read out to generate pursuit. The long-term goal is to determine how the brain represents dynamic sensory information and decodes the cues for behavior under natural conditions. This project could have a profound impact on our understanding of how the brain processes stimuli under natural conditions and for how we conceptualize sensory processing. The study will aid the development of software for retinal prosthetics that will remediate deficits in central visual processing by elucidating how the brain encodes moving scenes. Our Aims are to study (1) the Efficient sensory coding of dynamic motion stimuli in cortical area MT and pursuit. An adaptive sensory code maximizes information transfer by adjusting sensitivity and integration time to the current stimulus conditions. We will test the hypothesis that MT neurons adaptively encode motion, and that their coding efficiency impacts pursuit performance while the eyes are in flight. In natural moving scenes, fluctuations in motion are correlated across many time scales. We will measure the compression efficiency in MT firing and pursuit tracking of naturalistic motion by computing the mutual information between present response and future stimulus. Our second Aim (2) is to Quantify dynamic MT population encoding of motion inputs for pursuit. We will use the precision of pursuit as a benchmark to constrain models of cortical population coding, dissecting the contribution of patterns of spikes and silences -- across time and across populations of MT neurons -- to the encoding of target motion and to measure the size of the coding pool."
"9507289","Project Summary  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is a major human pathogen responsible for extensive mortality and billions of dollars in health care costs. Pa infections are particularly devastating in Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a disease associated with defective ion transport, tenacious airway secretions, and chronic lung infections. Pa is particularly pathogenic in CF because of its ability to form robust biofilms - slimy conglomerates of polymers that allow Pa to colonize airways and to evade antibiotics.  We recently identified Pf bacteriophages (phages) as a virulence factor that Pa uses to build biofilms. Pf phages are long, filamentous viruses produced by Pa that spontaneously organize extracellular matrix into a liquid crystal. This assembly is driven by entropic, charge-based interactions between Pf phages and host and microbial polymers. The resulting crystalline architecture fortifies biofilms, making them more viscous, adherent, and tolerant to antibiotics. We recently reported that many CF patients have crystalline sputum.  Because Pf phage-mediated polymer crystallization is highly concentration-dependent, sputum Pf phage titers in CF patients may have clinical significance. However, the prevalence and clinical impact of Pf phages in CF patients are unknown.  Along with enhancing the pathogenic features of established Pa biofilms, Pf phage may also promote the initial establishment of Pa infections. Pa dramatically increase Pf phage production without hours of intra-tracheal instillation in a mouse model of acute lung infection. Our preliminary data indicate that mice in this model clear Pa strains lacking Pf phage while Pf phage-competent strains reliably establish infections. In light of these contributions to the pathogenesis of Pa lung infections, we propose that Pa may partner symbiotically with Pf phage to promote Pa lung infections.  It may be advantageous to target Pf phage therapeutically. To this end, we have developed anti-Pf phage vaccines and monoclonal antibodies that target Pf phage and disrupt crystallization. Our data suggest that active or passive immunization against Pf phage may be an effective strategy for preventing Pa infection.  In light of these exciting preliminary data, we propose to test the hypothesis that Pf phages are critical virulence factors that can be targeted to prevent chronic Pa infections. To test this, In Aim 1 we will characterize how Pf phages impact clinical outcomes in CF. In Aim 2 we will define how anti-Pf phage antibody levels influence clinical outcomes in CF. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine whether anti-Pf phage vaccines and monoclonal antibodies prevent the establishment of Pa infections in animal models.  Together, these aims represent a bold, imaginative, and radically unconventional approach to Pa biofilm Infections. If successful, this work will provide the clinical rationale and mechanistic foundation needed to support R01-level investigations into the efficacy of anti-Pf phage immunization in CF and other settings."
"9164310","Abstract Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are undoubtedly a major public health concern and a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Among the arboviruses, mosquito-borne viruses collectively constitute some of the most important human pathogens. Recently, we have observed significant expansions in their geographic distribution, substantial increases in their virulence, and their adaptation to new vectors that have now increased transmission rates to humans. The importance of these viruses is further underscored by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics, or reliable measures that can be implemented to diminish disease. Recently, arbovirologists have become increasingly interested in the discovery and characterization of novel insect-specific viruses, in particular, mosquito-specific flaviviruses. Unlike the much better known mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses, which alternately infect vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, mosquito-specific flaviviruses appear to replicate only in mosquitoes and mosquito cells. A large number of insect-specific flaviviruses has been isolated from and/or detected in mosquitoes and sandflies collected worldwide, with very high prevalence rates among affected populations. Although these insect-specific flaviviruses are abundant in nature, very little is known about their ecological niche, their role in the evolutionary history of flaviviruses, the genetic determinants that render them unable to replicate in vertebrate cells, or to what extent they affect transmission of vertebrate-pathogenic flaviviruses in nature. Several studies have demonstrated that these viruses are mosquito-specific using conventional virologic techniques, but there are currently no data that describe their lack of replication in vertebrate cells at a cellular or molecular level, and no work has been attempted to determine exactly where the restriction to replication in vertebrate cells exist for these flaviviruses. Additionally, very few studies with conflicting results have been performed to determine the effect of mosquito- specific flaviviruses on their vertebrate-pathogenic flavivirus relatives, and no work has been done to identify the mechanism by which superinfection exclusion occurs among these viruses. This project will utilize a recently discovered insect-specific flavivirus (tentatively designated Aripo virus; ARPV) that is evolutionarily closely related to the vertebrate-pathogenic flaviviruses, as a prototype, to achieve the following aims: (1) to determine at what stage of the virus? replication cycle is ARPV restricted from replicating in vertebrate cells, and (2) to identify the mechanism by which ARPV precludes superinfection by vertebrate-pathogenic flaviviruses in mosquitoes. This study will utilize a wide array of techniques to determine if ARPV is restricted from replication in vertebrate cells because of an inability to attach and enter, replicate and/or translate its genome, or correctly assemble and release its progeny virions. We will also determine how ARPV affects the RNAi pathways in vitro and in vivo, and identify which components are responsible for preventing the subsequent superinfection by vertebrate-pathogenic flaviviruses, in a medically important vector species. Altogether, the results obtained from this project will be instrumental in understanding flavivirus biology, and will be readily translated to design new therapeutic targets, attenuate flaviviruses for novel vaccine approaches, and design biological control measures for important vectors through the use of mosquito-specific viruses or activation of key components in the RNAi pathway to prevent subsequent flavivirus infection. My most recent work involves the isolation and characterization of a novel insect-specific flavivirus, named Aripo virus (ARPV) that was isolated from mosquitoes collected in Trinidad. The complete ARPV genome was determined and phylogenetic analyses showed that ARPV is closely related to the pathogenic mosquito-borne flaviviruses. My work also shows that prior infection with ARPV reduces superinfection and dissemination rates of West Nile virus in vivo in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Experimentally, ARPV infection is also efficiently transmitted vertically in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, at least to the F3 generation. There is currently no work being undertaken to determine exactly where the restriction to replication in vertebrate cells exist for these insect- specific flaviviruses, and no work aimed at identifying the mechanism by which superinfection exclusion occurs between insect-specific and pathogenic flaviviruses. These new avenues of research involving flavivirus host restriction and mosquito innate immunity will form the foundation of my future research as I transition into an independent position. My preliminary work shows ARPV can attach and enter, and replicate and translate its genomic material in vertebrate cells, clearly demonstrating this is a productive line of research. Extensive theoretical and practical training in new experimental techniques are required to effectively complete my aims and successfully transition to an independent faculty. UTMB offers a vast plethora of opportunities including training in lab and project management, manuscript and grant writing, and mentoring and communication. UTMB contains renowned arbovirologists, RNA biologists, faculty mentoring programs, core facilities and many intramural funding options that will effectively guide and support my transition toward independent investigator status. This award will provide financial support and protected time to generate high quality data for R grant submissions. This award will support my long-term goal of leading an effective arbovirus research team."
"9481432","Project Summary When HIV-1 is transmitted from one individual to another, a major bottleneck takes place and only one or a few viral variants establishes infection in the new individual. The study of these special transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses is important because these viruses seed new infections. Since T/F viruses are the most important targets of prevention based strategies, a deeper understanding the phenotypic properties that correlate with successful transmission is crucial. Several phenotypic features of the Env glycoprotein clearly differentiate T/F HIV-1 from those that arise during chronic infection or after lab adaptation: T/F Envs are exclusively CCR5 tropic, they have fewer glycosylation sites and shorter variable loops, and they are more resistant to neutralizing antibodies. In this proposal, I will characterize a new feature of T/F HIV-1 variants which I have discovered: T/F HIV-1 is highly specific for the CD4 receptor of humans, whereas lab adapted HIV-1 is far more promiscuous and can enter cells through the CD4 molecules of all primate species that I have tested. This distinction is important because it further supports the idea that the lab adapted viruses that we have been studying for decades may not truly be representative of viruses that are naturally transmitted during infection. The objectives of this proposal are to study the evolutionary diversity of CD4 to identify receptor requirements that are critical to the successful entry and infection of T/F HIV-1 variants. The specific aims of this research proposal are to: 1) determine the extent to which CD4 imposes selection on lentiviruses during transmission, 2) investigate post- entry interactions between primate CD4 and Nef and Vpu from T/F HIV-1, and 3) identify nonhuman primate individuals with CD4 alleles best suited for studying HIV-1 transmission and early infection. Collectively, this research will provide critical insights into how we tackle modeling T/F HIV-1 infection in nonhuman primates. In addition, it will further our understanding of the biological interactions made between T/F viruses and their hosts, as well as aid in our understanding of how lentiviruses adapted to humans during zoonosis."
"9465461","Project Summary/Abstract: ?Bayesian image analysis in Fourier space (BIFS)?  The objective of this grant is to develop a family of new medical imaging processing methods that will advance the state-of-the art in radiological research and diagnostic evaluation. We will improve on commonly used spatial filtering methods, Fourier/wavelet shrinkage/sparsity methods, and conventional Bayesian image analysis methods by reformulating Bayesian Image analysis in Fourier Space (BIFS), i.e., by modeling in terms of spatial frequencies. Spatially correlated prior distributions that are difficult to model and compute in conventional image space can be more efficiently modeled as a set of independent processes across Fourier space. The originally inter-correlated and high-dimensional problem in image space is thereby broken down into a series of independent one-dimensional problems in Fourier space, where the independent distributions are tied together by our development of a parameter function over Fourier space. This independence over Fourier space structure coupled with the concept of the parameter function will enable us to develop new families of powerful and easy to specify BIFS models with fast algorithms to compute posterior image estimates. We will disseminate these methods to imaging researchers and clinical practitioners by developing a BIFS software package designed to solve a wide range of medical image processing problems.  The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) to develop novel BIFS models targeted to provide improved solutions to medical image processing problems; 2) to validate benefits of BIFS models compared with conventional processing methods based on careful simulation and phantom imaging studies; 3) to clinically validate improvements generated by BIFS modeling in two ongoing clinical studies: a) quantification of brain perfusion patterns associated with frontotemporal lobar dementia, and b) detection of breast cancer in MRIs; and 4) to disseminate the methods to the wider clinical and scientific communities by generating and releasing an R package for the implementation of BIFS.  Our innovative BIFS modeling approach has the potential to make a big difference in the field of medical image processing problems and image analysis in general. The impact on radiological application through the development of new, readily implementable and fast-to-compute BIFS models will lead to increased accuracy for the detection of findings in radiological screening and diagnosis; improved assessment of treatment efficacy; increased accuracy for measuring disease effects in imaging-based clinical studies; and expanded potential for practical image data-mining."
"9558732","Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): ABSTRACT Title: MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL NICHE FOR TUBERCULOSIS Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in mankind due to infections and more than 8 million new cases occur each year with 2 million deaths per year. Emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and extraordinarily resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates has rendered the control of tuberculosis very difficult. A third of human population is infected with latent MTB from which active cases arise. Paradoxically, HIV-1 infection can deplete CD4 T cells and enhance co-infection due to tuberculosis and death rate. There is extensive lung damage during ongoing tuberculosis, tuberculosis during HIV infection, and in particular during MD/XDR tuberculosis. Urgent methods are required to repair and restore lung function and concurrently eradicate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) from the lungs of humans with and without HIV infection. Phase I studies show that transfusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs; aka.stem cells) into patients with MDR/XDR patents was safe and there was partial clinical improvement in lung function and systemic immunity. Human bone marrow derived MSCs are unique because they can be grown in large numbers in vitro and infused back into humans from both allogenic and autologous sources. We made a new discovery that rapamycin-activated stem cells internalized and killed MTB in vitro through enhanced autophagy. We now propose that such `conditioned stem cells' can be transfused into patients with MDR-XDR tuberculosis to obtain enhanced killing of MTB and concurrent restoration of lung function. Since the cell biological basis of stem cell mediated infection control remains unclear, we propose the following studies to optimize stem cell administration into humans for immunotherapy of tuberculosis. SPECIFIC AIM- 1: Investigate the mechanisms of receptor mediated phagocytic uptake, cytokine and oxidant responses of MTB by human mesenchymal stem cells. SPECIFIC AIM-2: Investigate the mechanisms of inducing and maintaining autophagy in mesenchymal stem cells to develop immunotherapeutic methods. Rationale: We discovered that in vitro conditioned mesenchymal stem cells killed mycobacteria including BCG and MTB. Since autologous MSCs have been transfused in a phase I study and found relatively safe, we will assess the cell biology of stem cells prior to transfusion by analyzing mechanisms of MTB uptake into stem cells and correlate with cytokines and growth factors. We will analyze various surface receptors, phagocytic phenomena and associated oxidant synthesis to understand how stem cells can be conditioned to kill MTB. Since autophagy killed MTB within stem cells, we will evaluate the multiple mechanisms of inducing autophagy and their effects on stem cells. Impact of the project: The prevalence of MDR/XDR tuberculosis and HIV infection renders the control of both TB and HIV difficult. Lung damage in tuberculosis is well established. Thus, newer methods fo immunotherapy is urgently required. Once stem cell biology is investigated and understood, we anticipate that that `conditioned and improved' stem cells can be transfused into patents for effective control for infection in the lungs. The availability of large numbers of stem cells, the expertise to analyze the cell biology of stem cells suggest that this proposal will have lasting impact on immunotherapy for lung specific disease.

"9427194","ABSTRACT Despite decades of research, effective therapies for obesity are lacking. Given the magnitude of the obesity epidemic, there is a critical need for intervention strategies that effectively reduce body weight and maintain weight loss. Nodose ganglia (NG) neurons of the vagus nerve that innervate the gut are a key component of the nutrient sensing machinery that provides negative feedback to terminate a meal. Postprandial signals are sensed by vagal afferent terminals in the gut and the information is relayed centrally to neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). The neuropeptide cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) expressed by NG neurons is a primary molecular signal that controls caloric intake. In obesity, loss of vagal CART is sufficient to increase food intake and body weight. Therefore, we hypothesize that in diet-induced obesity, restoring CART expression in NG neurons will cause voluntary reduction in food intake and sustain body weight after weight loss interventions. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting CART and NG neurons innervating CART (NGCART) we will study 1) how metabolic cues are integrated in NGCART neurons, 2) how this information is relayed centrally, and 3) the impact of overexpressing CART in NG neurons on body weight. We apply powerful genetic and molecular neuroscience tools to the vagus nerve for in vivo imaging, connectivity mapping, and targeted overexpression in NGCART neurons. In aim 1, we propose to determine the metabolic signals that recruit NGCART neurons by using a Cre-dependent viral tracer injected into the NG of CARTCre mice to map the projections and terminals of NGCART neurons in the gut, and record the activation profile of these neurons in live animals by using a genetically targeted calcium indicator. In aim 2, we will combine multisynaptic circuitry tracing with serial two photon tomography to map NGCART neurons synaptic circuitry through the brain. In aim 3, we will use a cre- dependent CART overexpression virus to restore CART expression in NGCART neurons of CARTCre mice and determine the impact on feeding and body weight in diet induced obesity. These studies will elaborate on previous work by identifying a molecular and cellular target that can provide the foundation for developing peripheral treatments for obesity."
"9238787","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases."
"9540235","Project Summary In both humans and mice, natural killer (NK) cells are required for host defense against viral infection, most notably herpesvirus infections. To support viral clearance, NK cells robustly proliferate in an antigen-specific fashion, generate immunological memory, and exhibit enhanced functionality upon secondary encounter with the same virus. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these dynamic NK cell responses to infectious pathogens are incompletely defined. To address the requirements for NK cell expansion, I have examined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) the transcriptome of virus-specific NK cells during a model of mouse cytomegalovirus infection (MCMV). By comparing highly expressed genes in proliferating NK cells during MCMV infection to those in naïve NK cells, I have identified the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) as being enriched in MCMV-responding NK cells. Preliminary studies revealed that NK cells lacking IRF8 are impaired in their proliferative capacity, and this coincides with host susceptibility to MCMV infection. Thus, the goal of this proposal is thus to define the role of IRF8 in MCMV-specific NK cells during infection. In further preliminary studies, Zbtb32 was identified by RNA-seq as being significantly downregulated in Irf8-/- NK cells versus wild-type (WT) NK cells during MCMV-driven proliferation. This study will first examine whether IRF8 binds regulatory elements within the Zbtb32 locus by chromatin immunoprecipitation and whether overexpressing Zbtb32 in Irf8-/- NK cells, through generating novel retrogenic mice by retroviral transduction, can restore normal MCMV-driven proliferation (Aim 1). Subsequently, this study will use immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify distinct IRF8 binding partners in activated versus naïve NK cells that may underlie the infection-specific transcriptional program of IRF8 (Aim 2). Together, these studies will shed light on how IRF8 induction promotes the generation of potent MCMV-specific NK cell responses. By advancing basic knowledge of the mechanisms governing antiviral NK cell responses, the proposed research may reveal novel strategies for manipulating NK cell responses against pathogens in the clinic."
"9630430","Project Abstract Understanding the influence of the neural efferent and afferent regulation of ?-cell health and function would be an important advancement. Although it is known that neural input plays a critical role in the health of the pancreas, details of the neuroanatomy and neurobiology of the human pancreas remains largely unexplored. It may be that T1D patients, wherein residual ?-cells continue to secrete C-peptide, could benefit from neuromodulation therapies that stimulate neurovascular regrowth and result in anti-inflammatory effects in the pancreas. Furthermore, neuromodulation therapies may help to improve insulin secretion in patients with T2D or perhaps delay onset of disease for those at high risk for T1D (e.g. first-degree relative with T1D, multiple islet autoantibodies, genetic risk factors). Both knowledge of the functional neuroanatomy and enabling technologies to test this hypothesis do not currently exist. This project brings together a potent combination of experts in islet biology, neurophysiology, bioengineering, and clinical endocrinology with an innovative approach to define the comparative neuroanatomy of the human and rat pancreatic neural network. Our hypothesis is that pancreatic ?-cells, functioning like peripheral neurons, maintain blood glucose levels, in part, due to the neural regulation of islet blood flow. This novel hypothesis will be tested by one specific aim: 1) To determine pancreatic neuroanatomy. These studies will enable understanding and mapping of the autonomic and sensory efferent and afferent networks in normal human and rat pancreas. Importantly, our studies will map the human pancreatic neural networks utilizing specimens already collected from human organ donors without diabetes and those with T1D or T2D using optical clearing methodologies and high resolution 3D microscopy. The outcomes of these studies will provide critical design data for logical application of next-generation neuromodulation technologies to improve islet health. This proposed work is directly in-line with the SPARC program to understand comparative neuroanatomy of the endocrine pancreas to enable neuromodulation strategies for amelioration of end organ diseases."
"9534389","Abstract Heart disease kills more men and women each year than any other malady. Presently, we know that following cardiac injury in adult mammals, the contractile cells making up the heart, cardiomyocytes, are permanently lost and replaced by fibrotic scar tissue, severely affecting the hearts contractile function and physiology. Furthermore, we also know that cardiomyocytes possess the ability to divide and regenerate following injury in neonatal mammals. However, this regenerative capacity is transient, as cardiomyocytes are essentially incapable of dividing in juvenile and adult mammals. Importantly, we have uncovered one of the cell intrinsic signaling pathways responsible for preventing cardiomyocyte cytokinesis and regeneration in adult mammals. Namely, it is the Hippo-signaling pathway, which plays a central role in maintaining the proper size of organs, like the heart, through restricting cell proliferation. Remarkably, when Hippo-pathway components are knocked out in adult murine cardiomyocytes, they regain the ability to undergo cytokinesis and contribute to regeneration following myocardial function. So, both neonatal and postnatal Hippo-deficient cardiomyocytes are capable of renewing and regenerating, while adult cardiomyocytes can be classified as essentially non-mitotic and non- regenerative. However, the complete molecular mechanisms responsible for imparting neonatal and Hippo-deficient cardiomyocytes their regenerative abilities are unknown. What is more, it is possible that only a small, specialized subpopulation of cardiomyocytes are able to renew and divide post-injury. And that instead of global activation of neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation, there is an induction of this specialized cardiomyocyte sub-population to expand and regenerate the tissue. Yet, the heterogeneity of neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes remains undetermined, and the distinct cellular identity of proliferative and regenerative cardiomyocytes is unknown. Using innovative techniques in genetics, epigenomics, nuclear RNA sequencing, and single-cell transcriptomic profiling we aim to determine the genes, and signaling pathways responsible for promoting cardiomyocyte regeneration. Specifically, we propose to (1) define the cardiomyocyte-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes present during cardiac regeneration, as well as their up-stream transcriptional regulators, and (2) determine the heterogeneity and cellular plasticity of cardiomyocytes during regeneration."
"9420512","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In parallel with major recent advances in basic immunology, opportunities for clinical exploitation of this understanding have broadened, as has our ability to perform direct assessment of immunological mechanisms in humans. This is a cornerstone of the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) approach - clinical assessment of novel tolerance therapeutics, while simultaneously evaluating the cellular, genetic and immunologic mechanisms of disease and how they are altered in response to therapy. In this renewal application, we describe the scientific and operational framework that we propose to enable the ITN to successfully accelerate the development of tolerance therapies in transplantation, autoimmunity, and allergy. We will outline a process to evolve our current strategies into the next generation of planned trials, as well as how we plan to operate a nimble, future-focused organization, poised to lead and adopt future innovations that are currently unknown. We propose a collaborative structure involving hundreds of investigators, advisors, and clinical sites working in tandem with a core group of ITN staff, operating a program that is both scientifically and financially efficient. Several new innovations recently adopted by the ITN will encourage widespread involvement from academic investigators, including expanded resource sharing and data sharing operations. Three major institutions, the Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the University of California, San Francisco, form the administrative backbone for this application, with another twenty institutions represented in leadership and major advisory roles.         RELEVANCE: The proposed Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) grant addresses major unmet health needs. In the United States, autoimmune diseases affect >5% of the population, and allergic diseases affect another ~15%. Transplantation is a life-saving intervention for organ failure, but it comes with a significant burden and risk, in each area, pre-clinical studies show that immune tolerance should be an achievable therapeutic prospect for many affected individuals. Successful tolerance offers the possibility of long-term freedom from immunosuppressive therapy, bringing a radical improvement in terms of quality of life, disease burden, and health care cost."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         In this resubmission, the applicants propose to use their previously developed fibrin-specific 99mTc small tetrameric molecule agent (99mTc-F4A) to quantify and characterize thrombus formation in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) circuits and compare the nuclear signal with pump histopathology results.  The panel agreed that the applicants did a good job of responding to the concerns of the previous reviewers, including eliminating the aim regarding developing a handheld device.  The ability to detect thrombus formation in VAD is an unmet clinical need with high significance, the team of investigators was considered very strong and the research environment was considered good.  The tetrameric probe was considered novel, with decreased plasma interference and improved affinity over previous probes.  The approach was logical within the aims, although the panel was concerned that the order of Aims seemed backwards (imaging the VAD in Aim 1 and optimizing the probe in Aim 2).  It was also not clear if uptake would be detectable, especially in the presence of an attenuating medium.  Reviewers also expressed concern regarding lack of access to a scanner for large animal work, because they agreed that imaging in a large animal model was needed.  Although these concerns tempered the enthusiasm of the reviewers for this application, the significance was thought to outweigh the difficulties, and the panel concluded that the proposed work could have a high impact on early recognition of thrombus formation in LVADs."
"9410519","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the research proposed is to facilitate the construction of organic molecules by exploring unconventional reagents for cross-coupling and exploiting the unique attributes of such reagents. This will be accomplished by employing a recently developed, paradigm-shifting approach to cross-coupling involving a dual catalytic cycle. The two cycles, a photoredox catalytic cycle and a cross-coupling cycle, working in concert, will facilitate a single electron transmetalation protocol, allowing cross-coupling under mild conditions and, with the appropriate ligand, high levels of enantioselectivity via stereoconvergent transformations.     In particular, methods to do so from inexpensive, bench-stable, commodity nonmetallic organic precursors will be sought. A process using such materials would be robust, cost-effective, and scalable, leading to a facile transition from the academic setting to a process development facility. Employing the dual catalytic systems that have proven effective in studies on the cross-coupling of organotrifluoroborates, the protocol will be extended to non-organometallic bulk source materials, namely hydrazines and sulfinate salts. Studies on these commodity materials will focus on practical methods of effecting radical formation under photoredox conditions and assessing their viability in being funneled into the base metal catalytic cycle. Organocatalysts and inexpensive inorganic materials will be explored as potential photocatalysts to enhance the sustainable profile of developed processes. Photoflow-based technologies and strategies will be examined as a means of enhancing scalability and effectivity. Diverse electrophilic coupling partners will be examined, and stereoconvergent processes will be developed to access enantioenriched alkyl substructures. This protocol will be transformative in enabling unprecedented C-C bond construction via cross-coupling from nonconventional, inexpensive coupling partners."
"9419322","Project Summary Deficits in motivation and pleasure, together referred to as anhedonia, are implicated in a number of psychiatric illnesses, including mood and anxiety disorders, substance-use disorders, schizophrenia, and attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder. As a result, constructs related to anhedonia are central to the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project. Anhedonia is often one of the most difficult psychiatric symptoms to treat and thus represents a critical endophenotype and vulnerability factor for a range of psychiatric disorders. Given the centrality of anhedonia to a large number of psychiatric disorders, improved interventions to treat motivation and pleasure are critical for these disorders. The overall goal of this R61/R33 project is to develop a novel transdiagnostic treatment for anhedonia, called Behavioral Activation Treatment for Anhedonia (BATA). This new intervention is designed to treat anhedonia by emphasizing supported engagement with personally relevant goals and reducing avoidance behaviors. Consistent with the objectives and milestones outlined in RFA-MH-16-406 (?Exploratory Clinical Trials of Novel Interventions for Mental Disorders?), in the R61 phase of this trial we propose to use an experimental therapeutics approach to first evaluate mesocorticolimbic target engagement by this treatment in a transdiagnostic sample characterized by clinically impairing anhedonia (Aim 1). Specifically, we will examine the effects of this treatment, relative to an active comparison treatment, on caudate nucleus activation during reward anticipation and rostral anterior cingulate cortex activation during reward outcomes using ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging. In this phase of the project, we will also use fMRI to determine the optimal dose of the intervention (Aim 2). If quantitative milestones for target engagement are achieved, in the R33 phase of this proposal we plan to evaluate the effects of the optimal does of this new treatment, versus an active comparison treatment, on anhedonic symptoms and functional outcomes (Aim 3), behavioral indicators of reward sensitivity (Aim 4), and neural indicators of reward processing (Aim 5). If hypotheses are supported, the results of this project will change real-world clinical practice given that there are currently no empirically-validated treatments, psychosocial or otherwise, that target anhedonia transdiagnostically. Given the high rates of clinically impairing anhedonia across a range of psychiatric disorders, as well as the relative ease with which BATA can be disseminated, this novel intervention has the potential to rapidly and meaningfully impact patient care in clinics that specialize in a range of disorders and conditions, including mood disorder clinics, anxiety disorder clinic, and general outpatient psychiatry services. The application proposed here cuts across multiple NIMH priorities and initiatives, including an experimental therapeutics approach to treatment development (NOT-MH-14-007: Policy for Submission of Applications Containing Clinical Trials), the use of standardized phenotype measures (NOT- MH-15-009: Data Harmonization for NIMH Human Subjects Research via the PhenX Toolkit), rigor and transparency in research (NOT-OD-16-011: Rigor and Transparency in NIH & AHRQ Research Grant Applications), and data sharing with the scientific community (NOT-MH-14-015: Data Sharing Expectations for NIMH-funded Clinical Trials and NOT-MH-15-012: Data Sharing Expectations for Clinical Research Funded by NIMH)."
"9417506","Project Summary/Abstract  Oxysterols, the oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, have been identified for several decades, however, their roles in the physiology and pathological processes, particularly in nervous system, are largely unknown. Our previous study showed that the major cholesterol metabolite, cholestane-3?, 5?, 6?-triol (Triol), functions as an important endogenous neuroprotectant. Here, we hypothesize that blockade of acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) 1a serves as a novel mechanism underlying its neuroprotective effect, based on the following arguments and preliminary data: (1) The concentration of Triol increases after ischemic preconditioning (IPC), which contributes to IPC mediated neuroprotection; (2) The activation of calcium permeable ASIC1a exacerbates ischemic injury, and that pharmacological blockade or knockout of ASIC1a produces a significant protection; (3) In brain ischemia, blockade of ASIC1a has a therapeutic time window of ~5h, which is close to that of Triol (> 4h); (4) Our preliminary data clearly demonstrated that Triol significantly inhibits ASIC1a currents as well as its surface expression, at a concentration that occurs during ischemic preconditioning; (5) The preliminary data suggest that the inhibition of ASIC is specific to Triol, as its precursor cholesterol has no effect on ASIC currents. To rigorously test the hypothesis that Triol functions as an endogenous neuroprotectant through blockade of ASIC1a, the following specific aims will be examined: Aim 1. Determine the effect of Triol on ASIC current and calcium entry. Aim 2. Determine the inhibitory effect of Triol on ASIC1a surface expression. Aim 3. Determine whether the neuroprotection caused by Triol is mediated through inhibition of ASIC1a. Aim 4. Study the structure-activity relationship, and identify the amino acids that mediate the inhibitory effect of Triol on ASIC1a."
"9620306","PROJECT SUMMARY Calmodulin (CaM) regulation of CaV1-2 channels?termed calmodulation¾has proved enormously rich, both biologically, and as a general modulatory prototype with discriminating Ca2+ decoding capabilities. Mechanistically, a single Ca2+-free CaM (apoCaM) preassociates to the intracellular carboxy terminus of channels. Ca2+-binding to this resident CaM induces as-yet- unclear conformational changes that facilitate (CDF) or inactivate (CDI) channel opening, casting calmodulation as a positive or negative feedback control system for Ca2+. Intriguingly, Ca2+- binding to the C- and N-terminal lobes of CaM can each induce distinct forms of channel regulation, echoing earlier findings of CaM ?functional bipartition? in Paramecium. Beyond reach, however, is knowledge of subsystem interaction and dynamics; these deficits critically limit mechanistic advance and articulation of the biological impact of calmodulation. Moreover, the field is at a standstill regarding the structural underpinnings of calmodulation, owing in part to the difficulty that we and others have experienced in obtaining atomic structures of modules much beyond the small IQ domain. This structural indeterminacy fundamentally obscures the linkage of promising functional mechanisms to molecular reality. This project integrates multiple state-of- the-art strategies to transcend these obstacles according to three specific aims. 1) To clarify functional mechanisms of calmodulation via dynamic control of Ca2+ inputs to channels. 2) To identify the molecular states underlying CaM regulation of CaV channels. 3) To harvest mechanistic advances for biological insight and future therapeutics. In all, this project will sharply accelerate an already fruitful era of discovery, promising valuable advances regarding the function, structure, and biological aspects of CaV calmodulation."
"9559789","PROJECT SUMMARY Cryptosporidium (or Crypto for short) can cause life threatening opportunistic infection (OI) in AIDS patients. It is also a category B agent in the biodefense program. Currently, no drug is FDA-approved to treat cryptosporidiosis in AIDS patients, although a single drug nitazoxanide has been approved for use in immune-healthy patients. Our preliminary data have shown that triacsin C, an inhibitor against fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), could effectively inhibit C. parvum infections in vitro (e.g., IC50 = 136 nM). Most importantly, triacsin C (8-15 mg/kg/d) reduced the production of C. parvum oocysts in an acute infection mouse model by 56% - 88% with no observable toxicity to animals. These observations indicate that essential lipid metabolic enzymes could serve as novel drug targets in the parasite. The long-term goal of this translational research is to explore fatty acid metabolic enzymes as therapeutic targets against cryptosporidiosis. Because fatty acids are essential to all organisms, we hypothesize that ACS and ACC could serve as rational drug targets in Cryptosporidium. To test this hypothesis, we plan to perform experiments to achieve the following two specific aims. In aim 1, we will determine the efficacy of the ACS inhibitor triacsin C (TrC) in a chronic mouse model representing Crypto AIDS-OI. This aim is to extend the study from acute infection model to an AIDS-OI relevant chronic model. The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of TrC in mice will also be determined for establishing the relationship between the anti-Crypto efficacy and the kinetics of TrC in mouse plasma and in the lumen of the intestine. In aim 2, we will discover new chemotypes with highly improved medicinal chemistry properties by modifying triacsin C (TrC) and by high-throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries. Using two approaches here, we will increase the chance to obtain a more tractable lead compound, generate alternative leads, and diversify the lead structures. Upon completion of the proposed experiments, we expect to have generated key data, i.e., identified new lead structures with desired efficacy and medicinal chemical properties, for the next phase of ACS inhibitor development for the treatment of Crypto in AIDS patients."
"9560521","Abstract With the information we currently have available, a vaccine that prevents HIV infection outright in a substantial portion of vaccinated individuals seems out of reach. A far more realistic vaccine would be one that blunts acute viremia and, more importantly, maintains immunologic suppression of the virus for long periods of time without the aid of antiretroviral drugs. Such a vaccine should elicit potent T cell responses. The CMV vectored SIV vaccine has reinvigorated hopes that such a vaccine could be possible. One key to the success of the CMV vectored vaccine is its remarkable ability to prime and maintain CD8 T cell responses against SIV that are restricted in non-canonical fashion, specifically targeting SIV derived epitopes that are presented in the context of MHC-II and MHC-E molecules. However, it?s not clear at this time that the CMV vectored vaccine can be directly translated to HIV. Thus, more vaccine candidates are sorely needed that induce similar responses so that basic mechanistic experiments can be conducted to understand how other vaccine platforms can be made to induce similarly effective CD8 T cell responses. To this end, we have investigated a novel attenuated mutant of SIV that lacks just two amino acids in the Env cytoplasmic domain. This virus, termed ?GY, induces potent T cell responses along with no neutralizing antibodies, and protects pigtail macaques from multiple homologous and heterologous pathogenic SIVs. Remarkably, our preliminary data suggest ?GY, like CMV, elicits non-canonical CD8 T cell responses that, in vitro, can target and eliminate virus infected target cells. Here, we propose to capitalize on this phenomenon to begin to tease out these responses. To do this, we will use Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), which, in stark contrast to pigtails, exhibit remarkably simple MHC genetics due to a population bottleneck on the island. In Aim 1, we will vaccinate MCM with ?GY and comprehensively characterize the CD8 T cell response with focus on alternately restricted T cells, including determining their molecular restriction. In Aim 2, we will assess whether these responses can protect this species of macaque from pathogenic SIVsmE660. We will also expand T cell lines and clones in vitro from the vaccinated animals and determine their capacity to eliminate diverse pathogenic challenge viruses in vitro. Together, this highly focused experimental design will allow us to begin to dissect non-canonical CD8 T cells, their restricting molecules, and their ability to protect from diverse viruses. We hope these data will lead to larger projects designed to decipher the mechanisms, perhaps shared with CMV, that lead to these highly potent alternate CD8 T cell responses."
"9470441","Project Summary: One in seven men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) in his lifetime. While androgen deprivation therapy has achieved considerable success as the mainstay of PCa therapy since the 1940s, castration resistance remains common and devastating. As the third leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States, PCa results in over 26,000 deaths annually. Of patients who die from PCa, 90% are found to have bone metastases at autopsy. Strikingly, the five year survival rate for all PCa patients with spread to distant sites is 29%, while the same statistic for those with bone metastases is less than 3%. Any significant attempt to increase overall survival for patients with PCa must, therefore, be targeted to prevent, delay or eradicate bone metastasis. Tumor-derived exosomes have recently garnered significant attention for their potential as biomarkers, and also as mediators of pro-malignant signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor derived exosomes have been implicated in a diverse set of malignant processes including the epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, local and systemic immune suppression, and metastasis. The long term goal of the proposed work is to study the role of prostate tumor-derived exosomes (PCa exos) in promoting bone metastasis, and to investigate the therapeutic potential of agents capable of attenuating exosome-mediated malignant phenotypes. Preliminary evidence indicates that PCa exos are capable of (1) robust uptake efficiency in osteoclast precursors, (2) activation of NF-kB in a monocyte reporter line, (3) stimulating osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow macrophages in vitro, and (4) trafficking to bone when systemically injected in vivo in mice. Furthermore, preliminary evidence shows that a synthetic nanoparticle-based HDL mimetic (HDL NP) is capable of inhibiting each of the four PCa exo-mediated effects stated above. Given these observations, it is hypothesized that PCa exos play a role in promoting bone metastasis by signaling to osteoclast precursors to stimulate bone resorption. Further, it is hypothesized that HDL NPs are capable of reducing PCa bone metastasis by inhibiting PCa exo-mediated signaling. In the first aim of the study, we will investigate the relationship between the osteolytic activity of PCa exos and the bone metastatic potential of their tumor cell lines of origin. We will conduct molecular and functional studies of PCa exo-induced osteolysis in vitro and in vivo. In the second aim, we will investigate the role of PCa exos in promoting bone metastasis in a clinically relevant model of castrate-resistant bone metastatic PCa, assessing the impact on bone tumor establishment and growth, and overall survival. In the third and final aim of the study, we will investigate the potential of HDL NPs as inhibitors of PCa exo-mediated signaling in bone, and as inhibitors of skeletal metastasis in a bone metastatic model of PCa. Through these studies, we hope to clarify the role of PCa exos in bone metastasis, and determine the efficacy of HDL NPs as inhibitors of PCa exo-mediated signaling."
"9607157","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Program Director/Principal Investigator (Walt, David, R): Project Abstract To date, research aimed at identifying a biomarker for Parkinson's Disease (PD) has, for the most part, focused on measuring the levels of all isoforms of a given protein such as alpha-synuclein or DJ-1 in serum or CSF. These methods, however, have not had the sensitivity and specificity necessary to be used as an indicator of disease. Recent evidence suggests that specific post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination are key to the pathophysiology of PD. These post-translationally modified proteins have not yet been measured in serum because the concentrations of these isoforms are likely below the limit of detection of conventional ELISAs. We hypothesize that the detection of post-translationally modified proteins will be critical to PD biomarker development. Therefore, we will use technology, newly developed in our lab, which is 100-1000 times more sensitive than traditional ELISA to detect these isoforms. This new technology, Single Molecule Arrays (SiMoA), is a digital ELISA that counts individual molecules in solution. This proposal seeks to develop SiMoAs specific for post-translationally modified proteins relevant to PD. We will create a simple blood test and assess its sensitivity and specificity using serum samples from PD patients, healthy controls and individuals with other movement disorders provided by the PDBP. In sum, this application seeks to create a biomarker panel that is sensitive, specific, noninvasive and substantially cheaper than current diagnostic methods."
"9432160","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of clonal diseases of mutated hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), with more than 30,000 new cases being diagnosed each year in the Unites States. Given limited therapeutic options, long-term survival is less than 5% and new therapies are urgently needed. Genes encoding components of the cohesin complex are commonly mutated in human myeloid diseases, including 11% of patients with MDS and 21% of patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) arising in the context of MDS. Mutations in the cohesin subunit STAG2 have been recently identified as MDS-defining driver lesions. It is not understood how these mutations lead to MDS or leukemia, or whether cells with these mutations have vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically. Using quantitative immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry in STAG2 knockout cells, we identified incorporation of STAG1 into the mutant cohesin complex and loss of its interaction with splicing and RNA binding proteins. We also identified a synthetic lethal interaction between STAG1 and STAG2 loss, and CDK4 and STAG2 loss, the latter of which we corroborated by demonstrating selective killing of STAG2 knockout cells with CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 in vitro. Lastly, we demonstrated that STAG2 and STAG1 containing cohesin complexes have differential chromatin binding patterns. In light of these preliminary data, we hypothesize that STAG2 mutations alter cohesin complex formation and its chromatin association, with subsequent effects on gene expression through changes in critical long-range DNA looping interactions. To further define the mechanistic basis of mutant STAG2 mediated transformation in MDS, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Examine the effect of STAG2 loss on the composition of the cohesin complex; (2) Determine the transcriptional and epigenetic consequences of STAG2 inactivation; and (3) Validate CDK4 as a novel therapeutic target in STAG2 deficient cells in vivo. Mechanistic understanding of the STAG2 mutant cohesin complex promises to offer biological insight into MDS and identify new therapeutic opportunities. The applicant Dr. Zuzana Tothova is mentored by Dr. Benjamin Ebert, a physician scientist and expert in MDS, and co-mentored by Dr. Richard Young, a leader in the field of chromatin biology. Dr. Tothova has outlined a four-year career development plan to meet her goal of becoming an independent investigator in translational hematology, and she has assembled an Advisory Committee of internationally recognized experts to provide career and scientific mentorship. Dana Farber Cancer Institute is the ideal environment for completion of her scientific and career goals, given its outstanding research community and substantial record of training independent physician scientists."
"9453243","Project Summary Semi-occluded vocal tract (SOVT) therapy is widely used to treat various voice disorders, including vocal fold lesions and primary muscle tension dysphonia. The mechanism of SOVT therapy has not been thoroughly studied. The added vocal tract, which is often a straw, changes both supraglottal acoustic impedance, and static supraglottal pressure; however, how these parameters independently contribute to the voice therapy have not been clarified. We would like to observe the supraglottal effects as well as the acoustic impedance effects of phonation independently and quantitatively. Our long-term aim is to improve upon current methods of SOVT therapy by exploring the underlying mechanisms and finding the optimal SOVT configurations that allow for the greatest increase in best quality of phonation. The proposed research consists of two independent phases. During Phase I, an excised canine larynx model will be used for the independent scientific evaluation and optimization of three variables in SOVT therapy ? (1) length of vocal tract extension, (2) vocal tract outlet constriction, and (3) regulated supraglottal pressure input. Extending the length and constricting the outlet of the vocal tract increases the acoustic impedance which then increases supraglottal pressure and the ease of phonation. The use of a regulated pressure input is a novel addition to SOVT therapy, which allows the supraglottal pressure to be directly controlled. Wide ranges of each SOVT variable will be examined individually to determine the optimal levels of each modification. Vocal phonation will be systematically monitored through dependent aerodynamic, electroglottographic, and acoustic parameters, including vocal efficiency. During Phase II, in human subjects, we will independently assess the three variables of SOVT therapy on subjects with and without hyperfunctional voice disorders. The results from the studies using an ex-vivo model gives information based solely on the mechanism, with an unscaled pattern; whereas, Phase II studies will give insight into the dynamic and behavioral reactions present in human subjects. Effects on vocal economy will be evaluated using aerodynamic, electroglottographic, and acoustic parameters as dependent variables. Through a standardized therapeutic task, the effect of the modifications of SOVT therapy can be isolated. The studies outlined in this proposal will evaluate optimal SOVT therapy configurations through independently testing the three SOVT modifications. Further, we also will include long and short duration therapeutic tasks. By testing each modification across different task durations, we can identify the minimal task duration to achieve significant benefits. Monitoring the immediate and long-term effects allows further insight on the overall impact that this voice therapy can have."
"9524178","ABSTRACT  CD8 T cells are important contributors to the pathology observed in many autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes. Despite the importance of autoreactive CD8 T cells, much fundamental knowledge is lacking in several major areas, including i) the properties of class I MHC alleles that confer susceptibility or resistance to disease; ii) the determinants that underlie the promiscuous antigen recognition often displayed by autoreactive T cells; and iii) the contribution of the CD8?? co-receptor in facilitating autoimmune processes. These are the critical knowledge gaps that we seek to fill, and we will do so using a multidisciplinary approach and a collection of innovative strategies, reagents, and animal models. In Aim 1, we will define the biochemical and structural features and in vivo peptide presentation properties of human class I MHC alleles associated with susceptibility or resistance to type 1 diabetes. These studies will focus on HLA-B*39:06, B*39:01, and B*38:01, a closely related group of class I MHC alleles that are differentially associated with disease. We will test the hypothesis that the differential ability of these three alleles to mediate disease is the consequence of differential binding and presentation of certain disease-relevant beta cell peptides. Our newly developed NOD mouse models expressing human insulin or human IGRP will be central to this aim. In Aim 2, we will use the T cell receptors from a set of promiscuous and autoreactive CD8 T cell clones in structural and mutagenesis studies to define the mechanisms that underlie T cell receptor cross-reactivity. Among other approaches, we will take advantage of novel high-throughput assays that we have developed both to identify T cell epitopes and map protein binding interfaces. In Aim 3, we will use biochemical and biophysical approaches and in vivo models to better understand the interaction between CD8?? and peptide-MHC. Despite the requirement of CD8?? for CD8 T cell selection and peripheral activation, and its potential as a therapeutic target, crystallographic analysis of its interaction with pMHC is limited to a single structure of murine CD8?? with H-2Dd. Our own findings from mouse models we have recently characterized suggest that human CD8?? may be interacting with class I MHC in a manner not revealed by the single available structure. While autoreactive CD8 T cells under study here are likely to exhibit some unique features due to their necessity to escape tolerance mechanisms, much of what will be learned will be fundamental knowledge that is generally applicable to CD8 T cell biology and that will help guide the future development of more effective approaches to manipulate and harness the immune system in health and disease."

"9417064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Recent experience suggests that post-zygotic or mosaic mutations are a common cause of developmental disorders that can involve any organ system, although they are most easily recognized in vascular anomalies and skin. Several genes underlying rare syndromes with vascular anomalies have been identified, but so far only two that contribute to the more common non-syndromic forms: TEK for venous malformations and PIK3CA for lymphatic malformations, the latter recent work reported by the investigators. For both of these and several syndromic forms, the mutations are found in only or primarily in affected tissue and represent mosaic mutations.  We propose to identify and study the genes underlying other vascular anomalies using new genomics technologies. The genetics community has rapidly moved to whole exome (WXS) or whole genome (WGS) sequencing to investigate disorders such as these, but the success rate of such studies is only ~25% when germline inheritance is expected, and much lower for patchy or asymmetric disorders that suggest mosaicism. Our first aim is to develop new genomic and bioinformatics methods that will more reliably detect low level mosaic mutations using massively parallel (NextGen) sequencing approaches. We will next study how the level and distribution of mosaicism affects the phenotype, focusing first on disorders with known causative genes (initially PIK3CA) that can be evaluated reliably because of vascular and/or lymphatic involvement. Finally, we will use existing and new methods to search for novel genes underlying vascular anomalies, focusing first on more common and clinically important types such as such as arteriovenous malformations, the remaining unexplained lymphatic malformations (that is, not due to PIK3CA mutations) and hemangiomas. We expect this work to significantly expand our understanding of vascular anomalies specifically and the nature of mosaicism more broadly."
"9419205","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal application to support a training program begun in Uganda in 2000. The focus of our program has been consistent, with concentration on training in malaria research in Uganda. Our philosophy for training is to emphasize research, with trainees participating in both hands-on mentored malaria research and formal training programs designed to complement the hands on-training and facilitate growth of trainees into independent researchers. We believe that our program has been highly successful, as evidenced by the accomplishments of our trainees. About 50 Ugandan junior scientists have received advanced training, mostly at the Masters level, 13 of these trainees have so far advanced to PhD training, and our more senior trainees are advancing to academic positions in Uganda. Our trainees have authored ~250 papers during or after their training, with 61 first-author papers to date. We are gratified by the successes of our trainees. However, the need for training in malaria research in Uganda remains great. Thus, we feel that it is appropriate to continue our program, building upon our initial success and upon the structures for training that we have established. With maturation of our malaria research program in Uganda and an increased supply of highly qualified training applicants, we plan some changes to our program, in particular increased emphasis on higher level training. We now plan 5 training tracks: 1) short-term training outside Uganda; 2) Masters training at Makerere University; 3) advanced Masters training at UCSF; 4) sandwich PhD training at Makerere University; and 5) postdoctoral training. We are excited about our success to date with both training and research on malaria in Uganda, and we anticipate that continued funding will allow continued progress toward the establishment of cutting-edge independent research capacity in this country and also toward the control and elimination of malaria."
"9460582","ABSTRACT This K08 Mentored Career Development Award proposal describes a 4 year training program for the candidate, a neurosurgeon-scientist whose long term goal is to become an independent investigator in the field of primary malignant brain tumors, with a particular focus on the relevance of microRNA-mediated interference with GBM biology and survival response to conventional therapies. The basic science expertise earned by the candidate during his graduate studies while a resident in neurosurgery, put him in the ideal position to carry over this research. Previously, the candidate has shown that miR-128, a microRNA preferentially expressed in neurons, has an antitumor effect by targeting multiple GBM proteins involved with stem cell maintenance, as well as resistance to radiation therapy. He now hypothesizes that there are other microRNAs whose abnormal expression in GBM parallels that of miR-128, and thus that multiple microRNAs could work in functional clusters to effectively reprogram GBM cells into neuron-like cells by acting on a multiplicity of proteins with an epigenetic role. He also proposes that this can be harnessed to obtain a major sensitizing effect to radiation and chemotherapy. To test his hypothesis he proposes the following 3 specific aims: 1) to investigate the mechanistic and biological relevance of this observed clustering of several microRNAs in the regulation of multiple epigenetic complexes; 2) to design and construct a viral-based delivery method to re-express multiple microRNAs in GBM cells thus achieving substantial reprogramming of GBM cells into a more benign phenotype; 3) to explore how multiple microRNA re-expression can affect key cellular survival responses implicated in resistance to radiation and temozolomide treatment. This is extremely relevant because GBM is characterized by multiple aberrancies in several oncogenic pathways, which can not be targeted by single drugs, but could be regulated by these microRNAs clusters and their unique ability to simultaneously target multiple proteins fundamental to tumor biology. It is also very innovative, as it proposes a new approach to investigating the role of microRNAs in GBM, and also outlines a feasible method for producing artificial DNA sequences encoding multiple microRNAs that can be used in a gene-therapy setting. The candidate works in an exceptional academic environment, where he has already been able to set up his research laboratory, and will perform his experiments and proposed research under the guidance of Dr Chiocca and Dr Godlewsky as his co-mentors. Also, Dr Ligon, an expert in Neural and GBM stem cells and Dr Haas-Kogan, expert in DNA repair mechanism in brain tumors, will function as advisors for their respective areas of expertise. The candidate has already proven himself to be a dedicated and productive researcher, as demonstrated by his publications, awards, and funding, the last in chronological order being a K12 career development award obtained last year. To further advance his career development, the candidate has outlined his plan for specific hands-on training for mastering different research methodologies, such as comprehensive RNA and protein screening, interpretation of gene transcriptional analysis, and techniques for studying DNA damage and repair. In addition, the candidate will be involved in formal coursework in grant writing and responsible conduct of research."
"9628576","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposed K23 award is to prepare Dr. Megan McVay for a career as an independent scientist studying patient-oriented approaches to increase engagement in evidence-based weight management treatment among adults with obesity. To this end, Dr. McVay will obtain training in the areas of qualitative research methods, digital health intervention research, and the conduct of pragmatic clinical trials in primary care settings. The candidate and her mentors have developed a five- year plan to obtain training in these areas that includes coursework, workshops, and attendance at national conferences. Dr. McVay will work closely with her primary mentor, Corrine Voils, PhD, and her co-mentors, Gary Bennett, PhD, and William Yancy, MD, who jointly have nationally and internationally recognized expertise in behavioral weight loss treatment, qualitative research, intervention development, primary care-based clinical trials, and digital health interventions. The proposed research and training will be conducted in the resource-rich environment of Duke University Medical Center. The currently proposed research addresses the problem of poor uptake of evidence-based behavioral weight loss treatment through the development and testing of an intervention delivered via the primary care setting. Specifically, a web-based intervention that is completed by patients remotely, prior to a clinical visit is proposed. The intervention content will be individually tailored and will target determinants of treatment initiation based on our conceptual model, which draws extensively on the Health Belief Model. The delivery of the intervention remotely may allow more patients to receive evidence-based weight counseling while minimizing additional demands on clinic time and space. The first step of intervention development is to better characterize Health Belief Model constructs as they relate to weight loss treatment initiation in a primary care population, which will be accomplished through focus groups (Aim 1). Next, data from Aim 1 will be used to develop intervention content and the intervention website (Sub-aim 2.a.). This preliminary version of the intervention will be refined through usability testing and post-intervention qualitative interviews with patients (Sub-aim 2.b.) and through qualitative interviews with primary care providers (Sub-aim 2c). Finally, a pilot, pragmatic cluster randomized trial will be conducted in primary care clinics to determine intervention acceptability and the feasibility of proposed study protocol (Aim 3). At the end of the award tenure, the applicant will be prepared to submit an NIH R01 to conduct an adequately powered, pragmatic clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing treatment initiation and weight loss."
"9634368","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):: Diabetics are at increased risk of heart disease from several factors including geometric and functional changes that occur independently of other risk factor; this is termed 'diabetic cardiomyopathy'. Mechanisms of this disease are not completely understood, but data increasingly support the notion that aberrant lipid metabolism contributes to this disease process. Among these metabolic changes are perturbations in sphingolipid synthesis; others and we have shown that blocking sphingolipid synthesis ameliorates many facets of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Sphingolipid metabolism comprises numerous enzymes, pathways, and products; teasing apart specific sphingolipids that mediate a specific process has proven challenging. Moreover, mechanisms by which these processes occur have been difficult to determine. We recently published that a specific enzyme of sphingolipid synthesis, Ceramide Synthase 5 (CerS5), mediated lipid- induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and autophagy. In a high saturated-fat feeding model in mice, which caused insulin resistance and obesity, sphingolipid biosynthesis was perturbed in heart. We observed sphingolipid-dependent cell hypertrophy, autophagy, and most importantly, cardiac dysfunction. New preliminary data implicate sphingolipids in mitochondrial damage and mitophagy, and also shed light on molecular mechanisms by which CerS5 causes autophagy. We have observed 1-nuclear accumulation of CerS5 and its product C14-ceramide, 2-CerS5-dependent accumulation of p53 in the nucleus, and 3- sphingolipid-dependent loss of mitochondrial reserve, and increase in mitophagy. Here we propose to dissect mechanisms for DbCM based on these initial findings, and using a combination of strategies including in vivo determinations o diastolic dysfunction in mice lacking CerS5, components of the mitophagy pathway, components of the macroautophagy pathway. As evidenced by our recent publications (Russo et al. 2012, J. Clin. Invest.; Russo et al 2013, J. Biol. Chem.), we are highly suited to address these questions that lie at the interface of sphingolipid biochemistry and cardiology. To facilitat this highly translational work we have enlisted cardiology and metabolism experts to complement our expertise in sphingolipid biochemistry, signaling, and analysis. These studies will reveal roles of these cell processes in diabetic cardiomyopathy, address the controversy surrounding the nature of autophagy in cardiac injury, specifically whether it is adaptive or deleterious, provide insights into sphingolipid-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction, which is especially important in the diabetic context, and finally reveal cell, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of sphingolipid-dependent lipotoxicity in the heart."

Although they represent half of the global epidemic, development of effective prevention strategies for women has been slow. Tenofovir-based pre-exposure prophylaxis has demonstrated success in reducing HIV infections however two failed clinical trials have raised concern about effectiveness in women. Host factors such as inflammation, hormones, and the vaginal microbiome may modulate not only HIV risk, but drug efficacy as well. In this career development award, advanced training will be obtained in the techniques and approaches required to develop an independent scientist proficient in performing the translational studies required to better elucidate the complex mucosal environment of the female genital tract. This research proposal will lay the ground work studies characterizing the effect of hormones, inflammation, and the vaginal microbiome on drug exposure and efficacy in cervical tissues. Active metabolites of tenofovir and other nucleotide analogues will be measured in cervical biopsies from HIV positive women from U.S. and Ugandan cohorts receiving hormonal contraception. Quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines and 16S DNA sequencing will be performed in swabs to assess inflammation and the vaginal microbiome of these women. Ex vivo tissue models will be used to determine associations between inflammation, nucleotide analogue activation, and viral inhibition. Completion of these research aims, with the guidance of an interdisciplinary mentoring team, will be supplemented by advanced coursework and workshops in statistics, immunology, microbiomics, and research ethics. This research and training plan are designed to result in the preliminary data and developed expertise necessary to prepare for an R01 submission elucidating the complex interplay between hormones, microbiome, inflammation, drug disposition, target cell expression, and drug potency in the female genital tract."
"9134485","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background/Rationale:  People with serious mental illness (SMI) die, on average, many years prematurely, with rates of premature mortality 2 to 3 times greater than the general population. Over 60% of premature deaths in this population are due to natural causes, especially poorly treated cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious diseases. Although the VA is a centrally organized, comprehensive healthcare system, veterans with SMI still have difficulty navigating the system, and are at substantially elevated risk for premature death. Too often, they do not attend scheduled appointments or fail to engage in primary care treatment, and consequently do not get valuable preventive and primary care services.  Primary care in VA has undergone significant transformation under the Patent Aligned Care Team (PACT) model, which is based on the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) concept. PACT has the goal of improving the quality, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of primary care. But it remains unclear how PACT will impact the large populations of veterans who get the majority of their care in specialty settings, such as people with SMI. Research can inform efforts to apply the PACT model in specialty settings. For example, while people with SMI do poorly with usual primary care arrangements, there is now substantial evidence that integrated care and medical care management approaches can improve medical treatment and outcomes, and reduce treatment costs, in people with SMI. Objective:  Using available evidence, we propose to implement and evaluate a specialized PACT model that meets the needs of individuals with SMI (SMI-PACT). Methods:  This project will partner with leadership at one medical center to implement SMI-PACT, with the goal of improving healthcare and outcomes among people with SMI, while reducing unnecessary use of emergency and hospital services. Evidence-based quality improvement strategies will be used to reorganize processes of care. In a site-level controlled trial, this project will evaluate the effect, relative to usual care, of SMI-PACT implementation on (a) provision of appropriate preventive and medical treatments; (b) patient health-related quality of life and satisfaction with care; and (c) medical and mental health treatment utilization and costs. The project includes a mixed methods formative evaluation of usual care and SMI-PACT implementation to strengthen the intervention, and assess barriers and facilitators to its implementation. Mixed methods will also be used to investigate the relationships between organizational context, intervention factors, and patient and provider outcomes; and identify patient factors related to successful patient outcomes. Significance:  This project's approach to SMI-PACT is consistent with the VA PACT model, and with efforts in VA to improve care for veterans with psychiatric disorders. This will be one of the first projects to systematically implement and evaluate the PCMH and PACT concepts beyond primary care. Should SMI-PACT be demonstrated to be feasible and effective, the model could be used more broadly to improve the quality and efficiency of care for veterans with serious mental illness. Findings regarding PACT in specialty mental health may also inform efforts to improve care in other specialty healthcare settings."
"9473241","ABSTRACT  The goals of the human mast cell and tissue acquisition Core B are focused and straightforward: to provide key services that will be used by all three Projects. Core B will provide well-defined materials to each of these projects to ensure coordinated methods of approach, and will be available to troubleshoot if problems arise.  Located at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine under the leadership and supervision of Dr. Bruce Bochner, Core B will procure, catalog, store and ship de-identified biopsy samples from subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders and atopic dermatitis in collaboration with physicians and scientists located at Northwestern for use primarily by Project 3. A second important task for Core B is to generate enriched mature human mast cells derived from tissues such as discarded human skin, as well as samples of human large intestine and lung resection specimens from the Northwestern Memorial Hospital for use in in vitro experiments. The third focus of Core B is to assist with and directly generate ?humanized? mast cell mice employing a method by which CD34+ human cells are transplanted into the triple transgenic NSG-SGM3 (NSGS) mice expressing human IL-3, GM-CSF and SCF. Finally, the fourth responsibility of Core B is to maintain important human and mouse mast cell lines, and to generate culture- derived mouse mast cells from bone marrow of mice expressing human Siglecs and from the bone marrow of the transplanted NSGS mice to generate culture-derived human mast cells, the latter two for use primarily by Projects 1 and 2. In short, Core B will provide an efficient, standardized and centralized source for mast cells, humanized mast cell mice, and human tissue specimens. The experience and expertise in isolating and generating mast cells will be critical to the success of Project 1 and Project 2, while the availability of de- identified biopsies and discarded surgical tissues from well-characterized cohorts of patients and controls are essential to the aims of Project 3."
"9624597","ABSTRACT ? Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD. Project 1 will characterize risk factors for and emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and examine how these symptoms influence early detection and progression of ASD. This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.  "
"9419202","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We employ a progressive stepwise method of selecting and training young investigators. This stepwise training method permits screening of candidates at multiple levels and ensures that we invest in the most highly qualified and motivated individuals. In this application, we propose to develop a new program to extend our training to achieve a critical mass of researchers in Bolivia, where we are beginning to build local expertise. The proximity of Bolivia to Peru provides us with a unique opportunity to leverage the human capacity and infrastructure that we have built in Peru over the last 20 years, using a South-South training approach to more cost-effectively begin to build a scientific research community in Bolivia. There are several infectious diseases affecting public health in Bolivia, and we plan to focus our training on a few of the most important to the country: Chagas disease, cysticercosis, tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia, and HIV neurological co-infections. Over the past 25 years, we have developed a training network of developing and developed country institutions that is remarkable for its breadth, depth and sustainability. This program began with a focus on Peru, and has trained more than 90 Peruvian graduate and post-graduate students and 400 students of other nationalities, and the collaborative network of individuals and institutions tied to this grant has produced more than 350 original research articles in peer-reviewed journals. This network and infrastructure developed in our original program in Peru will be leveraged in the new proposed program to train researchers in Bolivia. We have the following steps in our program that will be completed under this D43 grant: Step 1. We will train 20+ students each year in infectious disease and research methods seminars in Bolivia, for a total of 100+ students during the 5 year grant. Step 2. We will train five students per year in laboratory rotations in Bolivia, for a total of 25 trainees during the 5 year grant. Step 3. We wil train two students per year in laboratory rotations at the UPCH, for a total of 10 trainees during the 5 year grant. Step 4. We will train two Bolivian students per year in a Master's degree program at UPCH, for a total of ten trainees during the five year grant. Step 5. We will support six Bolivian students to attend the Tropical Medicine and Public Health Summer Institute at JHSPH during the five year grant."
"9378710","Liver failure is characterized by a loss of hepatocytes or hepatic function due to an acute liver insult or chronic liver disease. Liver failure is often accompanied by neurological complications, called hepatic encephalopathy, which lead to reduced quality of life and increased mortality in patients. Acute liver failure is characterized by hepatocyte necrosis that occurs at a rate that is too rapid for the liver to regenerate resulting in a loss of liver function. In contrast, chronic liver diseases are characterized with progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis that can generate liver failure as hepatocyte death occurs and hepatic regeneration is impaired due to aberrant cellular processes. During chronic liver disease, transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF?1) has been well classified as a factor involved with apoptosis, inflammation and liver fibrosis and therefore contributes to the progression of liver pathology. We recently demonstrated that TGF?1 also contributes to the pathogenesis of both acute liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy and that this signaling protein promotes increased endothelial cell permeability following acute liver injury. Unfortunately attempts to develop therapeutics that target TGF? signaling have failed clinical trials. Therefore, targeting proteins involved in activating TGF?1 and/or proteins that interact with TGF?1 signaling may prove to be better tolerated by patients. Taking this approach, the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a homotrimeric glycoprotein that activates the propeptide form of TGF?1, and determine its contribution to pathology associated with acute and chronic liver failure. TSP-1 has been found to facilitate liver fibrosis through its interactions with TGF?1, though its actions during acute liver injury are not well classified. Our proposed specific aims will address two central hypotheses: (1) The hepatic expression of TSP-1 is elevated during acute liver failure leading to TGF?1 activation which drives hepatic inflammation, apoptosis, increased mortality and the development of hepatic encephalopathy; (2) Chronic liver failure is characterized by TGF?1 activation via TSP-1 which increases hepatic inflammation, fibrosis and other pathological processes associated with chronic liver disease. In this proposal, the pathogenesis of acute liver failure will be studied using a hepatocyte cell culture model as well as the azoxymethane-induced and acetaminophen-induced models of acute liver failure in mice. Chronic liver failure studies will employ rats that have undergone bile duct ligation surgery, a model of cholestasis and chronic biliary fibrosis with specific experiments targeted to assess cell-cell interactions in the liver. At the completion of this project, we expect to have determined the role of TSP-1 signaling on the pathological mechanisms involved with acute liver failure and chronic liver disease and will also determine the role of this signaling pathway in the development of hepatic encephalopathy. This will not only provide a greater classification of TSP-1 signaling during hepatic diseases, but could be used to identify potential therapeutic targets in patients."
"9336152","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSRACT Obesity is epidemic and ~50% of the United States population has diabetes or prediabetes. Furthermore, death rates from all causes are ~1.5 times greater for individuals with versus without diagnosed diabetes and the economic cost of diabetes in the US was $245 billion in 2012. Thus, diabetes and associated metabolic diseases represent major public health and economic burdens. Short nightly sleep duration and untreated sleep disorders are now recognized as risk factors for metabolic diseases with more than 50% of Americans sleeping less than the recommended 7 hours/night, and sleep and wakefulness disorders impacting 50 to 70 million Americans. However, the biochemical mechanisms by which sleep loss contributes to metabolic disease are largely unknown, impeding the development of novel and effective countermeasures that target the negative metabolic consequences of sleep loss. Furthermore, it is unknown if the common and self-selected countermeasure of weekend recovery sleep attenuates the negative metabolic consequences of sleep loss. As such, I propose to identify the influence of insufficient sleep on mechanisms underlying metabolic dysregulation and determine the impact of ?weekend recovery? sleep on these mechanisms. The proposed project will utilize metabolomics to analyze plasma samples from an ongoing in-laboratory study investigating insulin sensitivity and energy balance during insufficient sleep followed by weekend recovery sleep. Guided by my preliminary research efforts, I will use targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches to identify metabolites and metabolic pathways impacted by insufficient sleep and weekend recovery sleep. Additionally, the untargeted discovery approach may identify potential ?biomarkers? that change with sleep loss and ?weekend recovery? sleep. My proposed findings will help inform future validation and sleep countermeasure investigations including testing at risk populations (i.e. obesity, pre-diabetes, shift-workers). This proposed F32-award is responsive to a key goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan to ?enable sleep and circadian research training to inform science in cross-cutting domains, accelerate the pace of discovery, and the translation of enhanced therapies from bench to bedside to community?, and is designed to advance my training in sleep and circadian physiology and metabolomics to strengthen my potential for a successful NIH Career Development K-award."
"9422099","PROJECT SUMMARY Aging is universal and underlies chronic disease as well as tissue and cellular deterioration. The female reproductive system is the first to age in humans, with functional loss occurring decades prior to other organs. Reproductive aging is associated with both a decline in the number of eggs within the ovary and a decrease in their quality, which together, contribute to increased incidences of miscarriages, infertility, and birth defects. Our long-term objective is to attenuate the negative consequences of female reproductive aging, which are becoming more prevalent as women globally are delaying childbearing. Reproductive transitions, such as reproductive aging, is a priority of the Fertility and Infertility branch of the National Institutes of Health, and thus our work is tightly aligned with the mission of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Although considerable research has focused on age-associated changes in the egg, correspondingly less is known about how the ovarian stroma, the microenvironment in which the egg develops, changes with age and influences egg quality. A key stromal molecule found in the ovaries is hyaluronan. Hyaluronan is synthesized and fragmented in inflamed tissues and provides signals that exacerbate inflammation and drive fibrosis in several organs. Changes in hyaluronan are also implicated in aging tissues. Here, we will test the overarching hypothesis that ovarian hyaluronan levels decrease with age along with a corresponding increase in fragmentation of existing HA into a population of small molecules central to the pathogenesis of ovarian fibrosis and inflammation, which impacts egg quality. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. First, we will examine how hyaluronan content, fragmentation, and function change in the ovary with advanced reproductive age. These studies will be performed using reproductively young and reproductively old mice and will include analysis of ovarian biomechanical properties and the impact of hyaluronan fragmentation on ovarian follicle development. Second, we will investigate the extent to which perturbation of hyaluronan expression in vivo induces ovarian stromal inflammation and fibrosis. To accomplish this goal, we will evaluate indices of inflammation and fibrosis in mice genetically or pharmacologically deficient in hyaluronan and correlate this with fertility. Third, we will determine how human ovarian and follicular fluid hyaluronan levels and fragmentation profiles change with age using human material provided by two established research repositories at Northwestern University. We will investigate the clinical relevance of our findings by correlating hyaluronan levels and fragmentation profiles with reproductive aging markers and pregnancy outcomes after assisted reproductive technologies. The premise that the ovarian stroma contributes to reproductive aging represents a novel research frontier. Completion of the studies outlined in this proposal may reveal novel hyaluronan-related therapeutic targets or points of intervention aimed at improving fertility."
"9414034","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are powerful anti-diabetic drugs whose use in treating type 2 diabetes is limited by adverse side effects. The goal of this proposal is a biochemical investigation into a mechanism that separates the positive metabolic effects of TZDs from their side effects, making it possible to design a better class of agents. PPAR?, the molecular target of the TZDs, is a key regulator of systemic insulin sensitivity, adipogenesis, inflammation, and energy homeostasis. In adipose tissue, phosphorylation of PPAR? at serine 273 (S273) is observed shortly after the initiation of high fat diet feeding and increases with progressive obesity. This phosphorylation correlates with dysregulation of PPAR? target genes, such as decreased expression of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin. ERK is the primary kinase responsible for phosphorylating PPAR? S273, inhibitors of the MEK/ERK kinase pathway block PPAR? S273 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, MEK/ERK inhibitors had potent anti-diabetic effects in obese mice demonstrating markedly improved glucose homeostasis. Similarly, high-affinity ligands of PPAR??which lack the capacity to promote adipogenesis but still block S273 phosphorylation retain anti-diabetic effects. These two pharmacological interventions blocking PPAR? S273 phosphorylation both promote improved peripheral metabolic homeostasis like the TZDs while also appearing safer as they do not trigger the side effects associated with TZDs. Our hypothesis is that ERK-mediated phosphorylation of PPAR? in obesity and inflammation causes altered impaired glucose homeostasis by targeting adipose tissue transcriptional regulation. We will test this hypothesis using a novel genetically modified mouse where PPAR? cannot be phosphorylated on S273 (S273A). Our preliminary data suggest that blocking this phosphorylation is sufficient to improve insulin sensitivity in obesity. In this proposal we will utilize three approaches to understand the contribution of PPAR? phosphorylation to the pathogenesis of obesity. In Aim 1, we will interrogate the effects of PPAR? S273 phosphorylation on glucose homeostasis and the ability of PPAR? S273A mice to respond to PPAR? ligands. In Aim 2, we will investigate the relative contribution of blocking S273 phosphorylation in the immune system to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. In Aim 3, we will examine the genome-wide set of mRNA transcripts regulated and cis-regulatory elements bound to either wild-type PPAR? or phosphorylation independent S273A PPAR?. Understanding how obesity and inflammation modulates PPAR? by ERK- mediated phosphorylation will be important for the future design of new therapeutic molecules."
"9467758","PROJECT SUMMARY Multicellular life is defined by its organization of diverse cell types into higher-order tissues and organs. Millions of cells take part in a complex synthesis of gene expression, signaling cascades, and environmental sensing to maintain normal physiology. Disturbances in these processes can lead to illness like cancer, which results from aberrant cell growth and dysregulation. Understanding how cells behave at an individual level is therefore crucial to understanding both normal and abnormal physiological states. Previous investigations into cellular diversity have been limited by available technology. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) averages transcriptomic data across all cells present in a sample; while this is sufficient for relatively homogeneous organs, it is inappropriate for complex tissues. Single-cell RNA-seq is now revealing previously unappreciated heterogeneity in systems long thought to have been uniform, such as stem cells, neutrophils, and skeletal muscle. In a typical experiment, tissues are dissociated into a single cell suspension; individual cells are isolated, either into a microwell or in a microfluidic droplet; cells are lysed; and mRNA is uniquely barcoded and collected. Throughput of these techniques ranges from a hundred to several thousands of transcriptomes obtained in a single workflow. As a result, investigators have discovered several new and rare cellular subtypes in heterogeneous tissues like the retina. While the ability to catalog cell types is rapidly increasing, the capacity to infer meaningful information about these cell types lags behind. Open problems include dissecting the gene regulatory networks governing cell states and deciding whether rare cell types are biologically meaningful. How do rare cell states arise and how are they developmentally related to common cell types? This proposal aims to develop a new technology, single cell calling cards, to address these concerns. The calling card method relies on fusing a transcription factor (TF) to a transposase which directs the insertion of a transposon into the genome near TF binding sites. These marks are recovered from genomic DNA and subsequently analyzed. Aim 1 of this proposal merges our existing method with single-cell RNA-seq to create single cell calling cards, which can simultaneously characterize cell identity and record TF binding sites. Calling card insertions are permanent and can be used to study TF localization throughout development. Moreover, they can serve as genealogical markers. Aim 2 develops new from single cell calling cards data to delineate phylogenetic relationships between cell types. Successful completion of these aims will yield new technologies to study how, and when, diverse cell fates arise."
"9407294","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Bradley is an expert in design and evaluation of patient-centered, evidence- based care for alcohol misuse in medical settings. She is an Investigator at Group Health Research Institute (GHRI) and Affiliate Professor of Medicine and Health Services at University of Washington. She is also an Associate Investigator at Veterans Affairs (VA) Puget Sound Health Care System. She has conducted groundbreaking research aimed at implementation of evidence-based care for risky drinking and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in primary care. Her achievements include validation of the 3-item AUDIT-C in VA and non- VA populations and collaboration with clinical and quality leaders in the VA to implement alcohol screening and brief interventions (BIs) in over 900 VA sites nationwide. She has now expanded her focus to include management of AUDs in primary care. Dr. Bradley's currently funded studies aimed at improving alcohol- related primary care include: the CHOICE trial of nurse-delivered collaborative care for AUDs (NIAAA R01); a pragmatic trial of implementation of alcohol screening and BIs, and shared decision-making for AUDs, in 25 primary care clinics (AHRQ R18); and a study to develop a decision aid to support shared decision-making between primary care providers and their patients with AUDs (NIAAA R21). MENTORING EXPERIENCE and PLANNED MENTORING: Dr. Bradley is an outstanding mentor who has successfully mentored 28 early career clinician investigators. The proposed K24 will allow her to recruit and mentor 10-15 early-stage clinician researchers committed to patient-centered alcohol-related implementation research during the 5-year award. CAREER DEVELOPMENT: The proposed career award will support Dr. Bradley in achieving 3 career objectives: 1) to remain at the forefront of alcohol-related implementation research in medical settings; 2) to develop new expertise for implementing and evaluating eHealth interventions for AUDs-online and mobile health programs-in primary care; and 3) to mentor the next generation of innovators in alcohol-related research in medical settings. RESEARCH: New eHealth interventions for AUDs are being developed at a rapid rate and might especially benefit primary care patients with AUDs who are unwilling to enter treatment. However, the effectiveness of eHealth AUD programs in primary care is untested. Aim 1 will be to design a strategy for implementing one eHealth AUD program--online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-in primary care. Aim 2 will be to evaluate the implementation strategy for online CBT that we design in Aim 1.

The proposed career award will allow Dr. Bradley to mentor the next generation of leaders in innovative alcohol-related implementation research in medical settings, while expanding her research program to evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth programs for AUDs in primary care."
"9414616","DRIVING BIOMEDICAL PROJECTS PROJECT SUMMARY  Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are  naturally occurring polydisperse linear polysaccharides that are heavily O- and N-sulfated. The interaction  between GAGs and proteins are critical for many biological processes including cell-cell and cell-matrix  interactions, cell migration and proliferation, growth factor sequestration, chemokine and cytokine activation,  microbial recognition and tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. Hundreds of HS-binding  proteins have been identified, but the oligosaccharide structures that mediate particular interactions have been  defined in only a few cases due to the structural complexity of HS. Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) have  been selected based on their potential impact on health-related issues, their ability to drive (or test) technology  development within the Resource, and their compatibility with the current target area selected for our  integrated technology resource. Five years ago the focus of the Resource shifted to glycosaminoglycan (GAG)  - protein interactions. This is a challenging area raising problems associated with the characterization and  isolation of segments from highly complex GAG chains, production and examination of proteins that are  themselves glycosylated, and examination of the structure and biology of these systems in the context of large  multi-protein complexes and cell-based assemblies. The technology needed to deal with these issues is multi-  faceted and ranges from identification and production of GAG oligomers showing specificity in interaction  (TR&D1), structural characterization of protein-GAG complexes at multiple scales (TR&D2) and cellular assays  of biological effects (TR&D3). Any one problem can require integration of multiple technologies to reach a  solution, and DBPs are in many cases chosen to exploit the integrated nature of our Resource. We consider  the external investigator an integral part of this team, providing feedback on the success of technology  applications and on opportunities for technology refinement. The GAG-protein interaction area is rich in  potential impact. GAG-protein interactions play roles in migration of malignant cells, in normal and abnormal  development of human organs, in our ability to respond to disease, in the regeneration of injured tissue, and in  the transmission of signals needed for neuromuscular response. In addition to providing challenges for  technology developments, DBPs are chosen to have impact on these diverse disease related issues. We feel  that the projects selected adequately cover potential areas of impact and the need for technology drivers, while  allowing each DBP to move forward on a reasonable timeframe."
"9523078","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with more than 200,000 new diagnoses each year. The oncogene Myc is a common driver of TNBC. However, despite important research into the biologic and molecular functions of Myc, no tractable therapies have emerged to inhibit this oncogenic transcription factor. TNBC and other Myc-driven cancers remain recalcitrant to current targeted therapies, underlining the urgent need to identify new vulnerabilities in these malignancies.  In addition to promoting tumorigenesis, oncogenes such as Myc also produce unique stresses in cancer cells, collectively termed oncogenic stress. Using parallel whole-genome RNAi screens, we discovered that Myc imposes a new type of oncogenic stress on TNBCs that we term RNA splicing stress, or RSS (Kessler, Science 2012; Hsu, Nature 2015). In many cancer types, Myc (or other oncogenic insults) globally amplifies transcription leading to increased pre-mRNA burden on the spliceosome. Consequently, Myc-driven TNBCs are exquisitely sensitive to modest perturbations in the spliceosome (by enhancing RSS). Importantly, pharmacologic or genetic inhibitors of the spliceosome impair primary and metastatic progression of TNBC and are well tolerated in animal pre-clinical models. While spliceosome inhibitors have entered clinical trials, the mechanisms by which RSS and spliceosome inhibitors selectively kill cancer cells are unknown. Herein, we propose to discover the pathway(s) sensing and responding to RNA splicing stress and to delineate the mechanisms by which RSS triggers cancer cell death. Aim 1: Delineate the dsRNA-sensing pathways (DSP?s) stimulated by RSS in Myc+ TNBCs in vivo. Our preliminary data suggest that RSS induces TNBC apoptosis by triggering innate immune pathways that detect and respond to dsRNAs. By leveraging a TNBC PDX cohort with new genetic and proteomic platforms, we will determine how DSP?s and other stress response pathways are activated in response to spliceosome inhibition. Aim 2: Discover how RSS triggers dsRNA-sensing pathways in TNBCs. Many viral pathogens encode dsRNA genomes that are detected by dsRNA-sensors of the innate immune system. Our studies indicate RSS leads to cytoplasmic accumulation of intron-retained mRNAs, a potential source of dsRNAs. Using new sequencing and single-molecule microscopy methods, we will study the mechanisms by which RSS shapes the secondary structure and subcellular localization of TNBC transcriptomes and stimulates dsRNA-sensors. Aim 3: Delineate how DSPs and other stress response pathways govern TNBC response to spliceosome inhibitors. We hypothesize that there is a coordinated cellular response to RSS that parallels well-studied homeostatic stress responses like the unfolded protein response. By leveraging forward genetics and identifying new regulators of RSS, we propose to unveil a genetic framework for this novel type of cellular stress and provide new therapeutic inroads that exploit this cancer vulnerability."
"9412391","Ankle osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating and mobility limiting condition. It can commonly stem from the result of a traumatic injury ? such trauma has a high prevalence in military service. If cartilage is not severely damaged in that trauma, the stability and alignment of the joint may be. Over time, an unstable or misaligned ankle joint can experience abnormal rates of cartilage wear and tear due to aberrant kinematics. While OA may take decades to develop, the resulting arthritic state from this trauma will ultimately require ankle replacement or fusion, consequences with a tremendous financial burden and quality of life impact.  With regards to alignment, particularly in the coronal plane, current clinical diagnosis relies on static X- ray of the ankle joint. Static images may not indicate dynamic misalignment during gait. Further, the effect of wedged insoles, a potential conservative treatment, on the restoration of ankle function is undocumented.  This proposal aims to use biplane fluoroscopy, an X-ray based dynamic imaging approach, to measure ankle kinematics in OA subjects (with varus, neutral and valgus ankle alignment) and controls. With this method, tibio-talar kinematics during gait can be measured. Furthermore, subjects classified as neutral from their static radiograph, but that exhibit ankle varus or valgus alignment during gait, will be identified. Improving the accuracy of a diagnostic outcome provides a patient group with additional avenues for treatment. We will investigate correlations between our 3D kinematics and clinical 2D imaging ? to the benefit of clinical diagnostics. We will also be able to measure the effect of wedged insoles on the restoration of ankle function. With this in mind, the following aims and methodology are proposed.  Specific Aim 1: To investigate ankle kinematics in controls and subjects with OA. In support of Specific Aim 1, 90 ankle OA subjects will be recruited (30 each of varus, neutral or valgus aligned ankles). We will also recruit 20 control subjects. Subjects will receive CT scans of their feet to quantify bone geometry (a step necessary for biplane fluoroscopy). Subjects will then be imaged in the biplane system during gait trials and while wearing neutral study shoes. This will yield tibio-talar kinematics during gait for these populations. Specific Aim 2: To identify dynamically misaligned ankles in OA subjects who are currently classified as neutrally aligned using static analysis. We will compare the static X-ray and the gait kinematics of OA subjects, particularly those with clinically determined neutral alignment. We will determine what proportion of neutral OA subjects actually exhibit misalignment during gait and are thus improperly categorized. We will also re-create 2D clinical X-ray views from our 3D data in an attempt to translate our improvement (with 3D fluoroscopy) to more accurately classify alignment to clinical 2D diagnostics. Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the potential of lateral or medial wedging to restore alignment in misaligned ankle OA subjects. OA subjects will be imaged wearing shoes with wedged insoles which correspond to their type of misalignment. Neutral OA subjects, who demonstrate misalignment during gait, will be recalled for a wedged insole session. This yields conservative treatment kinematics.  This study will generate baseline data describing the kinematics of control and ankle OA subjects. This data is not currently available in the literature, and represents a novel contribution to the field. Second, this proposal determines how accurate current 2D X-ray methods are at detecting dynamic misalignment. This information can inform clinicians about the accuracy of their diagnostic tools, and may lead to improvements. Third, this proposal will generate data to evaluate the utility of wedged insoles for the conservative management of ankle misalignment. In Summary, this study has immediate impact potential on the diagnosis and treatment of ankle OA. Last, there are numerous additional avenues of classification, diagnostic, and preventative research for the benefit of the veterans which will stem from this Career Development Award."
"9392477","PROJECT SUMMARY For several decades, this and other laboratories have extensively investigated the causes and immune pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the prototypic systemic autoimmune disease. Despite considerable advances, particularly with regard to abnormalities in the adaptive immune system, several questions remained unanswered, including why autoantibodies in this disease are so often directed against nuclear antigens, and what is the initial trigger for these aberrant responses occurring even under sterile conditions? Emerging knowledge of a diverse array of mammalian sensors for nucleic acids, and the demonstration by us and others that these sensors are principal participants in lupus pathogenesis, have now provided new avenues of inquiry as to how this disease (and possibly many others) is initiated. We recently observed that congenic lupus-predisposed mice carrying an inactivating mutation of the proton/histidine transporter SLC15A4 (termed feeble) showed significantly reduced disease manifestations. The feeble mutation, discovered by others through ENU mutagenesis, has been shown to extinguish signaling by the endolysosomal TLR7 and TLR9, together with almost complete absence of production of type I interferons (IFN-I) and other proinflammatory cytokines by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) without affecting the development of these cells. Because of the apparent potential to therapeutically intervene with the function of SLC15A4, this proposal will seek to determine how the feeble mutation reduces autoimmunity by defining the functional characteristics of this molecule, the effects of the feeble mutation in lupus-associated innate and adaptive pathogenic responses, and ultimately to utilize high-throughput screening systems to identify pharmacologic inhibitors of this and other molecules necessary for self-nucleic acid sensing. The insights gained from these studies are certain to provide significant data on the biology of endolysosomes, TLRs and SLC15A4, and to reveal novel targets for therapeutic interventions in SLE and other autoimmune diseases."
"9541044","PROJECT SUMMARY A major regulator of synaptic function is local protein synthesis. Deep RNA sequencing has revealed that there are thousands of dendritically localized mRNAs. Local translation of selected mRNAs in dendrites provides a fast, adaptive mechanism for the experience-dependent formation of new synapses or the stability of pre- existing connections. This plasticity underlies changes in neuronal network dynamics and is therefore thought to be the foundation of learning and memory. Altered protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity are associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the pathways that regulate the dendritic proteome are not well understood. Protein synthesis in dendrites requires precise regulation of local mRNA stability and translation. A great amount of prior research has addressed the pathways that regulate translational derepression in dendrites. However, the mechanisms that control mRNA levels during synaptic function have not been demonstrated. We have recently shown that intra-axonal translation coupled to the mRNA-degradation pathway `Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay' (NMD) controls a switch in receptor expression and thereby regulates axon guidance; indicating that mRNA turnover is a key player in local protein synthesis. Currently, it is not known whether mRNA stability in dendrites contribute to the regulation of synaptic plasticity. The goal of this application is to understand the contribution of intra-dendritic translation coupled to mRNA- degradation pathway NMD to synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance. The synaptic plasticity protein Arc is a known target of NMD-mediated mRNA degradation, serving to limit the amount of Arc in dendrites. We have found that, in addition to Arc, NMD limits the amount of various other proteins involved in GluR1 regulation, which is essential for modulation of synaptic strength. Based on the published literature and our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that local NMD is as essential for synaptic function as it is for axon guidance. To test this hypothesis, we propose to determine whether NMD: 1) locally functions in dendrites; 2) promotes synaptic strength by restricting either internalization or translational repression of GluR1; 3) plays a role in different forms of synaptic plasticity (e.g. LTP and LTD); 4) is required for learning and memory. We will use a combination of techniques including a novel microfluidic device to uniquely study synaptic events, an inducible-genetic mouse model, electrophysiology and behavioral assays. Although NMD is the only RNA regulatory pathway linked to numerous neurocognitive disorders, it represents a relatively unexplored mechanism for regulating synaptic function. The successful completion of this research will provide a coherent view of local proteome dynamics in synaptic plasticity and might be valuable for providing new insights into the mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction and neurocognitive diseases."
"9446579","Project Summary Chronic stress for children growing up in poverty may lead to lasting effects on social, behavioral, and cognitive development. The difficulties of living in economic hardship has, indeed, been associated with deficits in cognitive and academic performance. The current study examines the link between poverty and executive functions (cognitive processes that facilitate learning, self-monitoring, and decision making) which are known to undergo rapid developmental change during the first years of life. Early neurological development will be examined as a mediator of this association examined from pregnancy to age 3. In addition to distal risk associated with living in poverty, we will investigate critical experiences within the proximal context (i.e., language exposure, caregiver behavior, child sleep hygiene) that may mediate the effect of this risk on child structural and functional brain development. Participants (n= 230) will be seen during the 28th week of pregnancy, and at 5 visits across the first 3 years of their child's life. Neuroimaging will be conducted at 2 weeks, 15 and 24 months (with an accompanying lab visit at 15 months). We will focus on developing white matter tracts that support cognitive processes of emerging executive functions: anterior cingulum (error monitoring); uncinate (joint attention); arcuate fasciculus (language processing) and individual differences in functional brain development, including resting state networks of salience, attention, executive control, and default-mode. At 6 and 24 months of age, an intensive home visit will include observational and objective measures of caregiver behavior, language exposure (via speech recorders) and sleep hygiene (via actigraphy for 7 days). Child cognitive development will be assessed at each assessment and an executive functioning battery will be administered at 36 months of age. This study will be the first to investigate the influence of poverty on emerging executive functioning at age 3 via effects on child neurological development over the first two years of life. In addition, findings will contribute critical information regarding whether specific measures of proximal experience (language exposure, caregiver behavior, child sleep hygiene) may mediate this risk.    "
"9509722","PROJECT SUMMARY Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming, obligately anaerobic, toxigenic bacterium that is the leading cause of hospital acquired antibiotic-associated diarrhea worldwide. Along with two other antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria, the CDC classifies C. difficile as an immediate public health threat that requires urgent and aggressive action. Accumulating evidence indicates that during infection C. difficile modifies its energy metabolism in response to changing nutrient conditions in the gut. Our results show that C. difficile possesses substantially greater metabolic versatility than previously appreciated, and is capable of rapidly shifting its metabolism to grow in the absence of several amino acids that until now were considered to be essential. Efficient growth on glucose in the absence of all major Stickland acceptor amino acids implicates an ability of C. difficile to readily adapt to a changing nutrient landscape in the infected host gut. Our studies further show that the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, an energy-generating system in acetogens and certain other anaerobic bacteria and archaea, is dramatically up-regulated in response to the shift to growth on carbohydrates -- a nutrient source that host-derived glycans may provide under conditions of limited amino acid availability. Under these conditions, the central enzymes in the pathway, AcsB and CO dehydrogenase, attain physiologically relevant levels not previously observed in C. difficile. Our hypothesis is that the Wood- Ljungdahl pathway allows C. difficile to effectively adjust its energy metabolism and possible biosynthetic requirements in response to changing nutrient conditions in the gut. To test this hypothesis our specific aim is to carry out a detailed characterization of the properties of a C. difficile 630 acsB deletion mutant. The effects on growth, metabolite profiles, qRT-PCR analysis of various transcripts, phenotypic microarrays, the ability to produce toxin and effectively sporulate will be compared with the wild type under various growth-supportive nutrient conditions to provide a comprehensive characterization of the mutant. The results will elucidate how the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway is integrated in the metabolism of C. difficile, and define how the pathway acts to confer a metabolic advantage to this pathogen. The findings will direct future studies to evaluate the pathway as a potential target for prevention or treatment of C. difficile infection."
"9498346","Project Summary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gammaherpesvirus that causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with B cell and epithelial cell cancers. EBV is an enveloped virus and therefore requires the fusion of the viral and cellular membrane to infect cells. The specificity of cell infection and membrane fusion triggered by the virus is for B cell entry is governed by four viral glycoproteins (gH, gL, gB and gp42), whereas EBV entry into epithelial cells requires three viral glycoproteins (gH, gL, and gB). The gB protein is thought to play the primary role in mediating membrane fusion, receiving activating signals from the other proteins after receptor binding to cells. The gH and gL proteins form a complex that also associates with gp42, and this three-way complex is necessary for binding receptors on B cells and triggering their infection. However, for epithelial cells, gHgL interacts directly with EphA2 triggering EBV membrane fusion and entry, presumably by activating gB. These triggering complexes of gHgL and cellular receptors are critically important for initiating EBV infection, but little is known about their structure and mechanism of action. In this proposal, the Jardetzky, Longnecker, and Zhou research groups will collaborate on studies of the architecture and mechanism of EBV epithelial cell triggering complexes, to gain greater insight into herpesvirus entry into cells. These studies may reveal general features of herpesvirus-mediated membrane fusion and open new possibilities for antiviral or vaccine development."
"9418126","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of stem cell-based therapies is currently not being fully realized due to the lack of appropriate pre-clinical animal models. Consequently, there remains a critical need to develop better animal models that better translate results from preclinical research trials to the patient. Scientific advancements addressing this problem have been realized through the identification of a naturally occurring Severe Combined Immuno- Deficient (SCID) line of pigs. The SCID pig model has been preliminarily characterized as both T and B lymphocytes deficient and thus is deficient in adaptive immunity. The pig is known to be an excellent model for human biology due to similarities in size, physiology and genetic code; and this novel SCID model has been successfully engrafted with multiple human cancer cell lines, indicating high potential as an in vivo model for many areas of regenerative medicine testing. We have received multiple requests and interest in obtaining this model. The research areas of these interested scientists spans many areas of regenerative medicine research, from cardiac progenitor cell therapies to cartilage regeneration studies, to the use of mesenchymal stem cells for bone regeneration and wound repair, to improving treatment of graft versus host disease in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants. A pig SCID model will have a specific positive impact in that it will provide researchers with alternative and comparative models for such stem cell research. Our long-term goal is to create validated SCID models for broad use in preclinical testing of such stem cell based therapies. The specific objectives of this application are to further develop this model for regenerative medicine testing, as well as improve its ability to engraft human cells into the bone marrow so that a human immune system can develop. Such an advanced model could be broadly used for vaccine testing and the study of human-specific pathogens. To maximize the broad use of these models, we will further develop protocols and design and test biocontainment facilities for practical utilization of our current pi lines. Our rationale for the proposed research is that the SCID pig is physiologically and phylogenetically more similar to humans than the mouse and therefore may more accurately reflect how proposed stem cells will survive and function in humans. This project is innovative because a SCID pig model has not been fully developed, and development of such model may result in significantly and rapidly advancing the fundamental knowledge of SCID into translational medicine capable of accelerating regenerative medicine research. With regard to expected outcomes, the successful completion of this project will create multiple genetic resources and associated animal procedures that will be highly desirable for SCID based modeling for research projects focused on the efficacy of stem cell therapeutics. Thus these unique resources are expected to have a significant impact in accelerating the translation of regenerative medicine research into the clinic."
"9378089","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Traumatic brain injury (TBI) impacts nearly 2% of the population and is a major cause of disability in the Veteran population, often resulting in long-term physical, cognitive and neurobehavioral impairments that prevent return to the workforce and community. It has long been appreciated that poor sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness are common and persistent symptoms after mild TBI. Data suggests that poor sleep interferes with recovery from TBI. What is not known is why sleep-wake disturbances persist after TBI. More effective therapies are needed for the treatment of TBI and associated post-concussive symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand mechanisms underlying sleep-wake disturbances in order to identify better therapeutic targets.  Our long-term goal is to understand why sleep-wake disturbances persist after mild TBI. Our central hypothesis is that TBI disrupts physiological cortical function which in turn alters glutamatergic inputs to hypothalamic sleep-wake circuits, resulting in sleep-wake fragmentation, and subsequently delaying cognitive recovery in individuals with TBI. Our hypothesis was formulated on the basis of our own preliminary data showing decreased excitability of hypothalamic wake-active neurons in a mouse model of TBI, and improved wakefulness with administration of a dietary therapy that is thought to increase synaptic glutamate content. The rationale for the proposed research is that, once it is known how changes in brain glutamate cause sleep-wake fragmentation in TBI, pharmacological manipulation of glutamate in sleep-wake circuits could yield novel approaches for recovery from TBI.  We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims:  1. Characterize regional patterns of sleep-wake dysfunction in TBI.  2. Assess glutamate and GABA changes during sleep and wakefulness in TBI.  3. Examine the effect of a dietary therapy on glutamate, GABA, and regional sleep-wake  dysfunction in TBI.  To accomplish these aims, we will first perform chronic, in vivo electrophysiological recordings across different cortical brin regions in freely behaving, brain-injured mice, analyze quantitative EEG measures in sleep and wakefulness, and correlate these metrics with behavior. Next, we will perform in vivo microdialysis in combination with EEG in brain-injured mice to determine extracellular glutamate and GABA levels in the hypothalamus during sleep and wake states. We will then use quantitative electron microscopy (EM) to confirm synaptic changes in glutamate and GABA in the hypothalamus. Lastly, given the hypothesis that our dietary therapy replenishes glutamate content in nerve terminal inputs onto wake-active neurons in the hypothalamus, dietary therapy will be administered to brain- injured mice to determine the recovery of extracellular glutamate and GABA (microdialysis), synaptic glutamate and GABA (EM), and sleep-wake measures (EEG).  With respect to expected outcomes, the work proposed in aims 1, 2 and 3 is expected to identify quantitative EEG metrics of sleep-wake dysfunction in TBI that predict functional recovery, and examine excitatory and inhibitory inputs to sleep-wake circuits in TBI that are amenable to therapeutic intervention. Such results are expected to have a profound impact on our understanding of TBI and post-concussive symptoms, by deepening our understanding of cortico-hypothalamic interactions in TBI-induced sleep-wake disturbances, and evaluating a therapy that has enormous potential to optimize wakefulness, and therefore recovery, from TBI."
"9416132","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."

"9529802","While the genomes of two people are >99% identical, the genetic differences encode amazing diversity in human traits and disease susceptibility. Understanding of the genetic architecture underlying human diversity in complex traits has been transformed by the application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, GWAS are just the first step in understanding how genetic variants contribute to disease risk by impacting genes that encode components of cellular physiology. Elucidating this chain of causality from SNP to gene to cell biology to disease can serve to not only functionally validate the genetic association with disease but also reveal potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, there is a need for approaches that can facilitate identification of the cellular pathways regulated by human genetic variants associated with disease. The objectives of this application are to systematically reveal the shared genetic architecture connecting cellular physiology and disease susceptibility and to develop a database to facilitate hypothesis generation from these data. The experimental and computational tools are in place to carry this out successfully. GWAS of molecular and cellular traits have been generated by our lab and acquired from publicly available datasets. An extensively validated cellular GWAS platform called Hi-HOST (High-throughput human in vitro susceptibility testing) uses pathogens to stimulate fundamental cellular pathways. Hi-HOST combines precise measurement of cellular phenotypes in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from nearly a thousand people with genome-wide association using 15 million genetic variants to identify genetic differences that underlie the phenotypic variation. With this platform, cellular responses of infectivity and replication, cytokine levels, and host cell death using 9 different pathogens have already been carried out and analyzed with family-based GWAS analysis on 148 cellular traits. Dozens of SNPs pass genome-wide significance have been incorporated into established workflows in the lab to validate their importance and determine mechanism. Additional datasets to expand our analyses beyond LCLs include metabolomics GWAS data from blood and urine and GWAS of immune cell levels. These molecular and cellular GWAS dataset will be integrated with human disease GWAS from the NHGRI/EMBL catalog. The central hypothesis is that the SNPs associated with each cellular phenotype and disease serve as a ?GWAS signature? that can be used to connect these different traits based on similarity and that the contribution of individual cellular traits to heritability of diseases can be estimated from comparing these signatures. Published methods developed by our own lab (CPAG (Cross-Phenotype Analysis of GWAS)), as well as by other investigators (LD-score regression) will be used to carry out these analyses. Thus, this project will integrate cellular and disease GWAS to create a re-interpretation of the human genome through the lens of cell biology. The project leverages existing datasets into a hypothesis generating engine for researchers looking to explore new diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities."
"9419935","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Younger potential unrelated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donors aged 18-30 are both the most clinically desirable and least available to donate after having preliminarily matched a patient in need of an HSC transplant. The ultimate goal of the proposed investigation is to improve availability of this younger donor group. The proposed study is focused on individuals aged 18-30 and will (a) identify differences between this group and older HSC registry members, (b) identify factors in younger registry members that are associated with opting out of the registry after having preliminarily matched a patient, and (c) generate and evaluate the acceptability and desirability of intervention strategies to improve younger donor availability. Within group comparisons by sex and race/ethnicity and comparison of younger new recruits to a matched sample of older registry members aged 35-44 will provide nuanced information that will allow us to tailor our potential intervention strategies. Our partner for the investigation is the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) which manages the largest registry of unrelated HSC donors in the world (> 11 million) and with whom we have an established history of collaboration. This investigation is important because (a) HSC transplantation is now a preferred treatment for life-threatening diseases of the blood, (b) increasing numbers of patients must seek HSCs from unrelated donors, (c) younger donors are the most clinically desirable group of donors, and (d) younger donors have the highest rates of unavailability when asked to donate. Innovative aspects of this research program include that (a) this will be the first systematic investigation focused on better understanding a younger group of potential donors who are both clinically desirable and less available, (b) we include variables such as community engagement, media and technology use, impulsivity, and parental influence which have not been previously included in this type of research but may be increasingly important to donation-related decisions among younger potential donors (c) the differential association of these characteristics with age, sex, race/ethnicity, and donation decisions have not been examined, and (d) this will be the first investigation to lead to the systematic development of intervention strategies to improve availability of younger HSC donors. Study aims are to (a) use web-based surveys to quantitatively describe younger newly recruited donors on five key classes of variables and to examine differences within this cohort by sex and race/ethnicity and between this cohort and an older cohort of newly recruited donors (n=1,248), (b) use web-based surveys to quantitatively compare younger registry members who continue toward donation after matching a patient with those who opt-out of the registry (n=1,440), and (c) to generate and qualitatively evaluate potential intervention strategies to improve younger donor availability. The NMDP strongly supports this investigation and is committed to using study findings to improve recruitment and management strategies for this group of highly valuable younger registry members."

This work is vital because we believe that a loss of  activity of SCG input to the brain and key structures within the body is responsible for the  expression of numerous inflammatory disorders including sleep apnea and nocturnal hypertension. As  such, we are confident that the work performed in this project will form the basis of future  development of novel stimulating devices that will be implanted around the post-ganglionic nerves  emanating from the left and/or right SCG in order to specifically treat a disease process that is  normally suppressed by the SCG projection."
"9396932","Project Summary: Mitochondria form interconnected reticula that dynamically break apart and re-fuse in response to multiple cellular cues. In mammals, mitochondrial fission and fusion are executed by large dynamin-like GTPases, including Opa1, Mitofusins 1 and 2, and Drp1. Mutations in the core fission/fusion machinery have been linked to several human disorders, including Dominant Optic Atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and lethal encephalopathy. Though numerous investigations have examined the structure and function of the mitochondrial fission/fusion machinery, considerably less is known about the upstream cellular cues that specify mitochondrial dynamics at steady-state. Our recent work demonstrated that the actin cytoskeleton is a key regulator of mitochondrial network morphology. Specifically, we observed that F-actin assembles on locally hyperfused mitochondria where it inhibits fusion and promotes robust Drp1-dependent fission. Upon actin depolymerization, mitochondria quickly re-fuse, forming new connections and reintegrating into the larger network. Over time, actin transiently assembles on all mitochondrial subpopulations in a sequential, step-wise cycle. Here, I propose to investigate the precise mechanism of actin assembly on to and disassembly off of mitochondria. Next, I will investigate the process of mitochondrial actin-cycling during different stages of the cell cycle. Finally, I will elucidate the role of CDK1 in regulating actin cycling. The work proposed here will provide mechanistic insights into the steady-state regulation of mitochondria networks by the actin cytoskeleton."
"9472628","Project Summary RUNX1 is a major hematopoietic transcription factor and RUNX1 haplodeficiency (RHD) is characterized by familial thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet function. We have a longstanding interest in the molecular basis of inherited platelet dysfunction, particularly related to RHD. Numerous platelet abnormalities have been described in RHD, several by us, and include deficiencies of dense granule (DG) and ?-granules (AG). Our platelet expression profiling studies in a patient with RHD showed that several genes are down regulated (MYL9, PRKCQ, ALOX12, PF4, PLDN, PCTP); and we have shown that these are direct RUNX1 transcriptional targets and impact platelet/megakaryocyte (MK) biology. The overall objective of this proposal is to obtain new insights into the mechanisms of endocytosis, vesicle trafficking, and ?-granule formation in platelets/MK through the study of phenotypic abnormalities and genes dysregulated in RHD. This project builds on unique abnormalities identified by us in RHD. We have reported in our patient that platelet albumin and IgG (incorporated by bulk endocytosis into AG) are decreased. Our expression profiling studies show that platelet RAB1B, RAB31 and DNM3 ? three GTPases closely linked to vesicle trafficking are decreased. Little is currently known regarding the mechanisms regulating endocytosis in platelets/MK or the role of these GTPases. Our hypothesis is that mechanisms of endocytosis and vesicle trafficking are impaired in RHD. Aim 1 is to obtain insights into mechanisms regulating endocytosis in platelets/MK through the study of mechanisms leading to the decreased platelet albumin and IgG in RHD. We will study uptake and transport of albumin and IgG in normal and RHD platelets, study the effect of downregulation of RUNX1, RAB1B, RAB31 and DNM3 on these processes in MK, perform studies using markers of secretory and endocytic pathways of vesicle trafficking. Aim 2 is to understand the mechanisms leading to AG deficiency in RHD. We will study: platelet AG in normal and RHD platelets focusing on selected AG proteins; the effect of downregulation of RUNXI, RAB1B, RAB31and DNM3 on AG and trafficking of AG proteins in MK. These studies will be performed on 5-6 patients with RHD and using induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) already developed from a RHD patient. They will provide important new insights into endocytosis and vesicle trafficking in platelets/MK, about which little is presently known. Relevance Platelets play a major role in hemostasis, thrombosis, inflammation, atherosclerosis and handling of pathogens. Our studies will provide new information on the basic aspects of platelet/MK function through studies in human RUNX1 haplodeficiency, a unique reservoir of information. This information will lay the foundation for new therapeutic approaches for both thrombotic and bleeding disorders."
"9459562","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alcohol consumption during pregnancy persists as a featured topic in public health, yet the impact of early pregnancy exposure on miscarriage risk remains uncertain. Despite recommendations for women who are planning a pregnancy or who might become pregnant to abstain from alcohol, over 50% of women report alcohol exposure at some point in the first trimester regardless of pregnancy intention. The objective of the proposed work is to examine the relationship between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and miscarriage risk through three approaches with the central hypothesis that the relationship between alcohol consumption and risk of miscarriage is dependent on timing of exposure. For my first aim, I will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the present understanding of this risk-relationship and to critically evaluate the design and analytical features of prior studies. After taking account of the current literature's shortcomings, such as the common practice of modeling alcohol consumption as a static exposure during pregnancy, I will delineate the relationship between alcohol use and miscarriage risk in the Right from the Start (RFTS) cohort for my second aim. RFTS is a community-based pregnancy cohort that is nationally recognized for its success in recruiting women in early pregnancy and collecting detailed information on first trimester exposures, including pattern of alcohol consumption in early pregnancy. Modeling alcohol use as a time-varying exposure is a more rigorous and appropriate technique than methods used in prior studies and estimating the risk- relationship with proportional hazard models will further improve upon past methods by accounting for timing of cohort entry and exit. For my third aim, I will investigate whether alcohol metabolism modifies the relationship between exposure and miscarriage risk by determining haplotypes of RFTS participants for the ADH1C gene, which is related to rate of alcohol clearance. I will then evaluate the interaction between alcohol exposure and haplotype in relation to miscarriage risk. Together, this work will provide more precise information about how pattern of alcohol exposure in early pregnancy relates to miscarriage and has the potential to inform more specific approaches for mitigating risk."

This task is achieved through many diverse avenues including publications in scientific  journals, presentations at conferences and symposia, web-based molecular modeling tools and tutorials  (GLYCAM), incorporation of new advances into Resource analytical services and hands-on training courses,  and collaborative research projects. Some highlights in the new funding cycle will be to disseminate  information about our resources particularly through: (1) web-based molecular modeling tools and tutorials  available via GLYCAM-Web (http://glycam.ccrc.uga.edu), which facilitate the modeling of glycans,  glycoproteins, and carbohydrate-protein complexes, (2) development of two software tools for GAG mass  spectrometry analysis will be made available to the glycoscience community that help in interpretation of  spectra for MS/MS analysis of native GAGs and simplify the analysis and statistical validation of the LC-  MS/MS spectra of derivatized HS oligosaccharides, (3) continued Resource related presentations,  organization of national and international meetings, and outreach to outside investigators through  publications, protocols and patents, (4) enhancements to our Resource website  (http://glycotech.ccrc.uga.edu) with detailed descriptions of our technologies and information on  collaborations and service activities, protocols, and advertisement for our annual hands-on training courses,  including the Analytical Techniques for Structural Analysis of Proteoglycans course that has particular focus  on this Resource's Technologies."
"9538331","Project Summary Heart transplantation is a vital therapy for end-stage heart failure. The effectiveness of this therapy, however, is largely limited by the shortage of donors. Regrettably, less than 40% of available heart donations are used for transplantation and the rate of use is declining due to increasing donor age. Transplants from donors older than 55 years of age are typically disregarded as increasing donor age is the strongest independent factor for both mortality and the development of chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV), the leading cause of graft loss for organ transplants. Additionally, older donor hearts often exhibit atherosclerosis, rendering them unsuitable for transplantation. However, the mechanisms by which donor age increases CAV remain unknown. Our prior work demonstrates that aged murine vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) contribute to vascular inflammation by producing IL-6, CCL2 and osteopontin via MyD88, an innate immune adaptor protein downstream of the Toll like receptors. Our preliminary data also indicate that aging impairs mitophagy, i.e., the clearance of damaged mitochondria, within VSMC to enhance vascular inflammation. We therefore hypothesize that impaired mitophagy within aged donor VSMC leads to MyD88-dependent vascular inflammation that enhances CAV. To test this hypothesis, we will use novel mice in which MyD88 is selectively deleted within VSMC to examine whether MyD88 expression within VSMC of the aged donor vasculature is critical for CAV in a murine heart transplant model (Aim 1). We will also examine whether MyD88 expression within VSMC of the aged donor vasculature is critical for the progression of pre-existing donor atherosclerosis after cardiac transplantation by employing a novel method to induce atherosclerosis in the donor heart prior to transplantation. In addition, we will use young mice in which either autophagy or mitophagy is disabled within VSMC, to determine if autophagy or mitophagy in these cells controls CAV (Aim 2). We will complement this approach by examining if administration of agents that enhance autophagy, e.g., rapamycin or mitophagy e.g., actinonin, to aged donor mice reduces CAV after cardiac transplantation. We expect that our study will directly link inflammatory pathways in the donor vasculature to CAV. Our results could lead to new therapeutics to reduce both the development of CAV and the progression of native vessel atherosclerosis in donor hearts. Such therapeutics could tremendously increase the pool of heart transplant donors and save lives of patients with end stage heart failure."
"9522708","FAM46C (Family with sequence similarity 46, C) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in multiple myeloma (found in over 20% of the patients). Mutations of other FAM46 family members (A, B and D) are also associated with various human diseases. Despite the strong connections with diseases, the functions of FAM46 in either physiological or pathological settings are unknown. The goal of the project is to fill the knowledge gap on the functions of the FAM46 proteins and the underlying mechanisms, paving the way for developing therapeutic strategies for the associated diseases. The project is based on our preliminary work showing the direct physical interactions of FAM46 with polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) and BRCA2 and CDKN1A(p21) interacting protein (BCCIP). Plk4 is the master regulator of centrosome duplication and ciliogenesis. BCCIP has been shown to be involved in regulating DNA repair and centrosome duplication. These together suggest that the FAM46 proteins regulate centrosome duplication, ciliogenesis and DNA repair. Centrosomes organize the bi-polar spindle formation and proper chromosome segregation in the cell cycle. In non-dividing cell, centrosomes mediate the formation of primary cilia, specialized signaling organelles critical for organogenesis and tissue homeostasis. A role in regulating these processes are consistent with the strong connection between FAM46 mutations and cancer. These hypotheses will be tested in three aims by combining X-ray crystallographic, biophysical, biochemical and cell-based functional approaches. Aim 1 will be focused on biophysical and structural analyses of the FAM46/Plk4 interaction. These studies will reveal the binding mode between FAM46 and Plk4, and identify key residues that can be tested by mutations in functional assays. In addition, potential mutual regulation of the enzymatic activities between FAM46 and Plk4 will be analyzed. Aim 2 will be focused on biophysical and structural analyses of the FAM46/BCCIP interaction. The crystal structure of the FAM46 and BCCIP complex will be determined to elucidate their interaction in atomic detail. Structural analyses will also be directed at the potential FAM46, Plk4 and BCCIP? tripartite complex. Mutational analyses will follow to test the binding mode and interface residues. The goal of Aim 3 is to analyze the roles of the interactions among FAM46, Plk4 and BCCIP? in regulating centrosome duplication, ciliogenesis and DNA repair. Fluorescence microscopy will be used to probe the localization of FAM46, Plk4 and BCCIP?, and their colocalization in and out of centrosomes in various stages of the cell cycle. The regulation of centrosome duplication, ciliogenesis and DNA repair by FAM46 through the interactions with Plk4 and BCCIP will also be analyzed by fluorescence microscopy."
"9515459","Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito borne flavivirus that recently emerged in the Americas. ZIKV infection is associated with severe disease outcomes, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly, a devastating congenital disorder where fetal brain development is impaired. Despite ZIKV?s status as a significant emerging disease threat, there are currently no approved vaccines or therapies for ZIKV infection. Thus a better understanding of ZIKV replication is needed to guide both vaccine and therapy design. While relatively little is known about ZIKV virulence determinants, a growing body of evidence suggests that RNA structural elements in RNA viral genomes play a major role in virus replication and pathogenesis. The full complement of RNA secondary structures within the ZIKV genome is not known, nor is it understood how these structures affect replication. We therefore used selective 2?-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP) to define the RNA structural landscape of the entire ZIKV genome of a clinical isolate from the ongoing ZIKV epidemic in the Americas. This analysis provided the first comprehensive view of RNA structure in the ZIKV genome. We identified RNA secondary structures distributed throughout the genome, including 19 regions with exceptionally high structural stability. These highly stable structures include known structures within the ZIKV 5? UTR and 3? UTR, thus validating the use of SHAPE-MAP to identify ZIKV RNA structures. The additional highly stable RNA structures are present across the coding region of the ZIKV genome and have not been characterized. These results demonstrate that the ZIKV genome is highly structured, and we hypothesize that the novel RNA structures may play important roles in multiple aspects of the ZIKV lifecycle. The fact that known flavivirus RNA structures are highly conserved suggests that some of the novel ZIKV structures are also conserved across flaviruses and may function as virulence determinants. Therefore, in Aim 1 we test whether novel, highly stable RNA structures in the ZIKV genome are important for ZIKV replication and pathogenesis. To determine the level of RNA structural conservation between ZIKV and other flaviviruses, in Aim 2 we use SHAPE-MaP to comprehensively define RNA structure in the entire genome of several other medically important flaviviruses (Yellow Fever virus, West Nile virus, and Powassan virus). These studies will significantly advance our understanding of how RNA structure impacts ZIKV biology, and provide new insights into whether highly conserved RNA structures broadly contribute to flavivirus replication and pathogenesis."
"9505014","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The major goal of this NCI Clinical and Translational R21 application is to reveal the cancer therapeutic and diagnostic potentials of a novel antibody-like chimeric fusion protein, Avaren-Fc lectibody (AvFc), in mouse tumor models. AvFc consists of the high mannose glycan (HMG)-specific lectin Avaren and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of human immunoglobulin (Ig)G1. Recent studies have revealed that HMGs are elevated on the cell surface glycome of various tumors. In normal cells, these glycans are processed into more complex forms in the endomembrane system and therefore rarely found on cell surface. Hence, HMGs may provide a new target for cancer therapy and/or diagnosis. However, there is currently no agent selectively targeting tumor-associated HMGs. Our preliminary data showed that AvFc is capable of binding to a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines, including leukemia, melanoma, and lung, breast, colon and cervical cancers, but not to noncancerous human cells. Additionally, AvFc exhibited strong antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity against various cancer cells tested. AvFc showed good safety profiles in mice upon repeated systemic administration. Lastly, AvFc is efficiently bioproduced in tobacco plants using a plant virus vector. Given these promising developability profile, we hypothesize that AvFc could be developed as a first-in-class cancer therapeutic and/or diagnostic agent targeting tumor-associated HMGs. To prove this hypothesis we propose two specific aims in this application. In Aim 1, we will investigate AvFc's anti-tumor activity in murine tumor challenge models. We will use well-established syngeneic and human tumor xenograft models to determine the effectiveness of AvFc. In Aim 2, we will employ dynamic positron emission tomography scan and radiolabeled AvFc to determine their in vivo biodistribution and tumor specificity in mice. Additionally, we will attempt to isolate and identify tumor cell-surface glycoproteins targeted by AvFc, using a proteomics approach. Results generated in this project will provide a compelling preclinical data package for the development of AvFc as a novel therapeutic and/or diagnostic agent targeting tumor-associated HMGs. Additionally, our data will provide a new basis and a unique tool to investigate the as-yet-unknown roles and mechanisms of elevated HMGs in tumors."
"9524169","PROJECT SUMMARY Antibodies are routinely used as therapeutic agents to fight a wide range of disorders including asthma, blood cancers, breast cancer, arthritis, and transplant rejection. Humoral immunity against infections depends on the germinal center (GC) differentiation process in the B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs, such as spleen and lymph nodes. In GCs, B cells rapidly proliferate and somatically mutated high-affinity antibody secreting cells, i.e. plasma cells, are generated from naïve B cells in response to T cell-dependent antigen. To date, the scientific community has relied on animal models to generate high-affinity antibodies and discover fundamental knowledge of GC immunology. Yet scientists are far from understanding the extracellular and intracellular factors that contribute to the exuberant pace of the GC reaction and conversion to antibody secreting cells (ASCs). Recent in vivo studies have uncovered crucial signals such as CD40 ligand (CD40L) from T cells, B cell activation factor from follicular dendritic cells, cytokines, and integrin ligands from the surrounding lymphoid niche, that are required for the induction of GCs and selection of high-affinity cells. Developing biomaterials to recapitulate the process of generating high affinity, antigen specific antibodies ex vivo via the GC process could enable more rapid development of antibodies for use in the treatment of a number of chronic diseases. Such tissue models can also be used to improve the mechanistic investigation into signaling and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate GC B cells. The goal of this study is not to recapitulate all aspects of an in vivo model, but rather to generate a model that will inform the natural process in vivo, and also the development antigen-specific ASCs ex vivo. The specific aims will focus on engineering designer organoids with tunable ligand specificities, understanding the antigen specific immune response, and establish a link between integrin ligand specificity and cell cycle epigenetics of GC reaction."
"9431254","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease: a novel developmental oligodendrogliopathy Huntington's disease (HD) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder that typically presents with progressive cognitive/motor deficits. Although HD exhibits a unitary genetic basis (mutant huntingtin [mHtt]), our understanding of HD pathogenesis remains poorly defined. The hallmark of HD is degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Therefore, study of HD has focused predominantly on cell autonomous mechanisms mediating MSN death. However, there is increasing recognition that HD pathology also encompasses dysfunction of oligodendrocytes (OLs), myelin and white matter tracts (WMTs). These defects occur during prodromal phases of HD, suggesting that non-cell autonomous mechanisms mediated by OLs may play important roles in HD pathogenesis. Here, we test the hypothesis that postnatal WMT abnormalities are: (1) secondary to defects in the second wave of developmental forebrain oligodendrogliogenesis leading to ectopic persistence of non-myelinating OLs from the first wave, and (2) necessary for region-specific profiles of forebrain vulnerability to neurodegeneration. This developmental hypothesis is based on our experimental data showing: (1) impairments in multiple NSC-mediated MSN developmental parameters in a HD knock-in mouse model, (2) early and stable OL impairments in HD mouse models/human pathological specimens, (3) key conjoint roles of Gsx2 in mediating MSN and OL second wave developmental functions, and (4) selective temporal ablation of mHtt after neural development recapitulates characteristic features of HD (EUREKA R01). Our Specific Aims are to define: (1) roles of ventrally- vs. dorsally-derived developmental OLs in HD WMT abnormalities, (2) pathogenic roles of OLs and WMT abnormalities in HD pathogenesis and therapeutic benefits of OL-based molecular genetic and cell replacement interventions. Our research approach will study: (I) differential ontogenic expression of Gsx2 in HD, (II) dynamic OL-specific lineage aberrations in HD, (III) molecular genetic rescue of Gsx2-dependent OL deficits in HD, (IV) role of HD-associated OL abnormalities in HD pathogenesis via conditional ablation of mHtt in OL precursors, (V) effects on HD onset/progression of OL cell replacement strategies. The Significance includes: (A) defining the developmental nature of HD OL lineage abnormalities, (B) establishing that a non-neuronal/non-cell autonomous mechanism is part of the pathogenic cascade leading to neuronal cell death, (C) establishing that HD represents a new class of primary developmental oligodendrogliopathy, (D) initiating entirely new directions for gene and cell based therapeutic studies during the prodromal phase based upon the HD-mediated OL developmental dysfunction. The Innovation is (1) proposing a novel mechanism underlying HD pathogenesis by incorporating a two-hit model including developmental forebrain OL deficits, (2) employing OL lineage-tracing to study the HD developmental oligodendrogliopathy, (3) using time-specific conditional genetic manipulations to rescue the putative HD developmental oligodendrogliopathy, (4) using cell replacement of OL developmental species to treat HD."
"9470679","Abstract Monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, modulate fast synaptic transmission in circuits that mediate many complex behaviors including aggression, sleep, attention, and mood. In psychiatry, many therapeutics target monoamine systems at either the receptors or transporters that mediate and regulate monoamine neurotransmission. The vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) is responsible for loading all monoamine neurotransmitters into both synaptic vesicles (SVs) and large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), which mediate synaptic and extrasynaptic release, respectively. However, the functional contribution of each type of vesicular release to circuit function and behavior is unknown. Previous studies in Drosophila have demonstrated that the amount and site of amine release can be altered by mutations in the C-terminal trafficking domain of Drosophila VMAT (DVMAT). In a DVMAT null genetic background, the function of several circuits and behaviors are perturbed, but are rescued by transgenic expression of wild-type and trafficking mutant alleles. However, some behaviors are not rescued by trafficking mutants. Mutations that cause DVMAT to preferentially traffic to LDCVs do not rescue function of the oviposition circuit. This suggests that the oviposition circuit is highly sensitive to the delicate balance between synaptic and extrasynaptic release of the neurotransmitter octopamine (OA). I hypothesize that trafficking mutations in the endogenous DVMAT gene locus will confer circuit dysfunction, resembling genetic rescue experiments. To further test this idea, I propose to create a new genetic model of DVMAT trafficking using CRISPR/Cas9 to alter trafficking signals in the endogenous gene. My preliminary data demonstrate that indel mutations that disrupt the DVMAT C-terminus phenocopy previous experiments. This novel genetic model will be useful to study the effects of mutants at endogenous expression levels, facilitates combinations with genetic and molecular tools for circuit analysis, and represents a new platform for genetic screens to find novel regulators of DVMAT function. I propose to study the contributions of the different modes of monoamine release in the Drosophila melanogaster oviposition microcircuit. I hypothesize that alteration of the mode of amine release will result in patterns of muscular contractions and rhythmic activity in target organs that will differ from wild-type animals. These proposed studies will elucidate novel mechanisms of aminergic signaling and new avenues for the research and development of new therapeutics for psychiatric disorders."
"9414008","DESCRIPTION: With 35 million HIV-infected individuals worldwide, the challenge to improve health in these individuals is vast. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV replication, which prevents AIDS and reduces overall mortality; however ART does not fully restore health. Indeed, despite sustained suppression of viremia, individuals cannot discontinue ART as residual HIV persists, and virus rebound is inevitable if ART is discontinued. This residual HIV reservoir is associated with ongoing inflammation. Cannabis is a widely used drug in the United States, and derivatives of cannabis such as cannabinoids are commonly used in treatment of nausea and cachexia in severe conditions such as cancer. Several studies have demonstrated that cannabinoids have the propensity to alter immune responses and decrease inflammation in vivo. We hypothesize that cannabis use in the context of ART-treated HIV infection may decrease inflammation and the persistent HIV reservoir. Here, we provocatively propose to test this hypothesis in humans by measuring inflammation, immunity, and the HIV reservoir from blood and gastrointestinal (GI) tissues from HIV-infected individuals who report using cannabis daily compared to those reporting no drug use. Furthermore, we will assess mechanisms of cannabinoid anti- inflammatory activity ex-vivo using cannabinoid receptor agonists in co-cultures. In addition, we will exploit the non-human primate model of SIV infection to test causality of this unconventional idea, by treating ART- treated, SIV infected macaques with cannabinoids to assess the effects on SIV reservoir and inflammation. With an outstanding team of researchers, we will assess the following: (i.) Global systems biology, including species-specific transcriptional analysis and bioinformatics; (ii.) The HIV and SIV reservoir using novel assays to measure integrated, total and inducible virus; (iii.) Inflammation and immunophenotype of immune cell subsets; (iv.) Systemic microbial translocation and GI tract barrier integrity; and (v.) drug levels and kinetics in blood and GI tract. We believe these proposed studies will be integral to better understanding facets associated with the HIV reservoir and may provide a novel therapeutic approach, exploiting a drug of abuse, towards development of an HIV cure."
"9457698","Flaviviruses including dengue, West Nile, and Zika viruses, pose significant threats as emerging diseases and potential bioterror agents. Despite the considerable impact of flavivirus infection on world-wide health, no antiviral therapies are available, and existing flavivirus vaccines are of limited utility. Our long-term goal is to obtain detailed structural and biochemical information regarding the flavivirus replication complex and to use this information for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. The flavivirus replication complex, consisting of virally-encoded non-structural proteins (NS), unidentified cellular proteins, and the viral RNA genome, is responsible for copying the viral genome and 5' RNA capping. However, how the various components of the replication machinery are arranged as a functional complex is not known. Specifically, the 5' RNA capping machinery is functionally and physically linked to the replication machinery as multi-domain (i.e., methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) within NS5) and larger multi- protein (i.e., NS3 and NS5) complexes, but little is known regarding how RNA synthesis and RNA capping are coordinated. We have recently determined the crystal structure of the full-length dengue virus (DENV) NS5, in which MTase and RdRp could coordinate their respective activities in both monomer and dimer configurations. In the current application, we will determine how NS5 interacts with viral RNA and the NS3 protein, two other essential components in the viral replication complex. In Aim 1, we will probe how NS5 interacts with the 5' end of viral RNA, called stem loop A (SLA), to promote viral RNA synthesis. We will determine the structure of the SLA by cryo-electron microscopy, and its interactions with NS5 by a competition binding assay. In Aim 2, we will determine specific interactions among NS3 and NS5 domains during coordination of RNA synthesis and 5' RNA capping using infectious DENV RNA. In Aim 3, we will determine the X-ray crystal structures of NS5 and its RNA complexes, including SLA, dsRNA, and a `dual' substrate that binds simultaneously to both MTase and RdRp domains to represent different steps along the viral replication pathway. The combined structural, biochemical, and virological studies will help elucidate the mechanism for coordinated RNA synthesis and capping reactions in NS5."

The Specific Aims are: 1) Identify and characterize host leukocyte populations necessary to promote streptococcal mucosal clearance; and 2) Characterize streptococcal persister strains in mucosal epithelial tissues. The proposed work is innovative, capitalizing on the use of a long-term, mucosal carriage murine model for S. pyogenes developed by the Candidate, combined with transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling to characterize streptococcal persister strains in vivo. The Rationale is that through this proposed work it may be possible to develop novel strategies to stimulate mucosal immunity, or specifically target the metabolic activities of long- term persister strains, to promote streptococcal eradication from the mucosal epithelial environment."
"9412161","Project title: Pathogenic Role of EPAC1 Signaling in Retinopathy of Prematurity SUMMARY Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the leading cause of vision impair and blindness in the USA in the childhood. Laser photocoagulation is the standard-of-care for treating retinal neovascularization (NV) in ROP, and supplement cryotherapy is occasionally used in severe cases. These treatments only target pathological neovascularization (NV) and have many limitations. There is great need for new strategies and therapies to target other aspects of the disease, including retinal neuronal injury, and promote vascular repair in addition to the control of NV. This study is to determine the role of Epac1 in neuronal injury, pathological NV and physiological vascular repair, and determine the therapeutic effect of Epac inhibitors. Our central hypothesis is that Epac1 activation plays a key causal role in retinal neuronal injury, impairing vascular repair and promoting retinal pathological neovascularization during oxygen-induced retinopathy. This application will, for the first time, use Epac1 global KO mice, Epac1 conditional KO mice and novel Epac inhibitor to investigate the cAMP/Epac1 pathway in retinal neuronal injury, NV and vascular repair. It will address specific contributions of neuronal vs. endothelial Epac1 in these processes, and investigate potential mechanisms of Epac1-induced retinal neuronal and vascular alternations. The research is expected to significantly advance the mechanistic understanding of retinal neurovascular pathologic changes and should facilitate the development of novel strategies to prevent NV, protect retinal neurons and improves vascular repair in ROP."
"9416131","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."
"9526308","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mucormycosis, most commonly caused by Rhizopus oryzae, is a lethal infection in patients with increased available serum iron (e.g. from diabetes), or in patients with neutropenia or steroid-treatment. The population- based incidence rose by more than 50% during the first decade of the 21st century. Unfortunately, the mortality rate of mucormycosis has remained ?40%. New strategies to combat mucormycosis are urgently needed.  Using small molecule iron chelators, we found that iron sequestration can protect diabetic mice from lethal mucormycosis. However, animal models showed that small molecule chelation therapy was much less effective, and had substantial toxicity, in neutropenic mice. Consistent with this finding, the follow on clinical trial was enriched for neutropenic patients with mucormycosis, and had very few diabetics--the drug failed.  The current application is based on a novel biological approach. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of transferrin to restrict microbial growth via iron sequestration. We showed that treatment of mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Candida albicans markedly improved survival. A major advantage of transferrin over small molecules is its safety. Small molecule chelation alters iron excretion patterns, chelating iron away from myeloid cells, which are normally the predominant recyclers of iron in the host, with resulting hematopoietic toxicity, and delivering iron to renal tubules where iron does not normally get excreted, with resulting nephrotoxicity. Thus, serious toxicity to bone marrow, kidneys, and other organ systems can occur, which offsets efficacy benefit in neutropenic hosts. In contrast, administration of transferrin utilizes and enhances normal myeloid iron sequestering routes in the body, and thus may overcome limitations of small molecule chelation, avoiding myeloid and nephrotoxicity in such patients. Specific Aims: 1. To dose-optimize rhTransferrin in treatment of mucormycosis in diabetic, steroid-treated, or neutropenic mice. Two rounds of transferrin dose optimization will be studied vs. placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint will be time to moribund condition, and secondary endpoints will include tissue fungal burden, inflammatory cytokines, and tissue histopathology with rhTransferrin vs. placebo. 2. To determine the impact of combination therapy with rhTransferrin plus liposomal amphotericin with or without an echinocandin during mucormycosis in diabetic, steroid-treated, or neutropenic mice. The efficacy of rhTransferrin alone vs. plus liposomal amphotericin (LAmB) vs. plus both LAmB and an echinocandin, will be compared to LAmB plus echinocandin without transferrin (positive control). Outcomes will include time to moribund condition, fungal burden, inflammation, & histopathology. The results of these experiments will support a follow-on R01 to define mechanism of protection, breadth of protection across fungal species and genera, and pharmacodynamics. Furthermore, results will support rapid translation of transferrin as an adjunctive therapy for mucormycosis in patients."

"9446280","The goal of this proposal is to continue studying the development of functional circuits in the retina. Immature retinal neurons spontaneously generate correlated activity in the form of waves of action potentials that sweep across the retinal ganglion cell layer. These retinal waves occur during the developmental period when functional circuits within the retina are emerging and retinal projections to the brain are undergoing a tremendous amount of refinement. Recent discoveries indicate that light penetrating through the closed eyelids may also influence retinal firing patterns during development. In this renewal, we focus on two Aims that explore the impact of early vision on retinal activity and the potential roles it plays in development and early light guided behaviors. In the first Aim, we explore the mechanisms by which spontaneous activity modulates early light responses mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) during the first postnatal week. IpRGCs, which express the photopigment melanopsin, are the first photoreceptors that mature in the retina, and they therefore provide the earliest light-driven signals to the brain. We recently published that blockade of retinal waves increase the number of light responsive cells via an increase in gap junction coupling between ipRGCs and other retinal neurons. Here we explore the mechanisms underlying this activity-dependent modulation of coupling and its function in early light-guided behaviors. In the second Aim, we investigate how retinal waves interact with these emerging visual circuits of the retina during the second postnatal week, just prior to eye-opening. Specifically we will test the novel hypothesis that light stimulation alters the properties of retinal waves and determine whether this light modulation of waves is critical for refinement of retinofugal projections. Experiments are based on state-of-the art technologies that include volumetric two-photon imaging of genetically encoded calcium sensors. This work will address the principles that establish the mechanisms underlying spontaneous activity in developing circuits and the role these principles play in activity- dependent developmental processes. It will also elucidate the principles that govern the normal development of the human nervous system, thus making it possible to understand the origin of neurological birth defects and to devise strategies that enable the nervous system to regenerate functioning neural circuits after injury."
"9559838","ABSTRACT Although potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV infection to undetectable levels of plasma viremia, the stably integrated HIV genome continues to persist as a viral reservoir in long lasting resting CD4+ T cells (rCD4). There is substantial ongoing effort to identify therapeutic approaches that will eliminate or reduce the size of this reservoir. However, clinical investigators lack a universal measure to assess whether or not a decrease in the latent reservoir has been achieved. The quantitative viral outgrowth assay (Q-VOA) which quantifies inducible, replication-competent HIV-1 from rCD4+ T cells, is used extensively to quantify size of latent viral reservoir, but it provides only a minimal definitive estimate of the size of the latent HIV-1 replication- competent pool. Additionally, the Q-VOA cannot be used to measure the size of the latent replication competent pool HIV-1 in tissues, which represents a major sanctuary site for latent HIV-1.Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a high throughput, sensitive, and well-validated assay that can quantify replication competent HIV-1 in blood and tissues which will help in developing strategies to eradicate HIV-1. We have recently published a reporter cell-based assay, termed TZA, to quantify inducible replication-competent latent HIV-1. TZA has several advantages over existing technologies in that it (i) is more sensitive; (ii) requires only a small blood volume and (iii) is significantly faster and less labor intensive. Using this assay we show that the size of the inducible latent HIV-1 reservoir in aviremic participants on ART is approximately 70-fold larger than previous estimates. The primary goal of this application is to further develop and characterize this assay so that it can be universally used to quantify the pool of replication-competent HIV-1 in blood and tissues. The Specific Aims of the project are: 1) To characterize the inducible replication-competent latent HIV-1 reservoir in the blood of infected subjects using the TZA. To achieve this goal, we will validate the TZA in the HIV Reservoir Assay Validation and Evaluation Network (RAVEN) project by comparing its sensitivity, dynamic range, and reproducibility with other assays for quantifying replication competent HIV-1 in PBMC from a large and well characterized repository of samples from HIV-infected participants on suppressive ART therapy. As a part of the additional validation of the TZA we will measure the dynamics of the size of replication-competent pool of virus in these cells in subjects who initiated therapy during the acute or chronic stages of infection in subjects from the MACS; 2) To quantify replication-competent HIV-1 in semen and gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) from aviremic subjects under ART using the TZA. Ultimately, we anticipate that further development, refinement and validation of TZA will provide a much-needed tool to quantify viral reservoir in blood and tissues that could be widely used by investigators involved in HIV-1 cure studies."
"9452969","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain organizes information about the sensory world into maps. Prominent examples are the maps of eye-preference and retinotopy in the lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus  and visual cortex. Experiments in this proposal will advance our understanding of mechanisms responsible for the development of precise neural circuitry in the mammalian brain. We will employ a broad range of techniques, including molecular biological, cell biological, neuroanatomical, electrophysiological and advanced optical imaging techniques in vitro and in vivo. We focus our experiments on maps of eye preference and retinotopy in the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus of the mouse. These structures are the dominant target of retinal projections to the brain. The lateral geniculate nucleus is the primary relay of visual information to the visual cortex, and the superior colliculu is a sensory motor structure that has emerged as an ideal model system for the examination of neural circuit development and function. It is widely hypothesized that molecular cues are responsible for the establishment of coarse map structure in the lateral geniculate and superior colliculus, and activity dependent processes subsequently refine these sensory motor circuits to functional precision. We first propose to definitively establish whether patterned spontaneous activity is necessary for the development of visual maps. We next propose to manipulate the temporal pattern of activity in the developing retina to examine the dependence of retinocollicular development of retinal ganglion cell activity. We finally propose to manipulate th spatial pattern of activity in the developing retina to examine the dependence of visual map development on the spatial character of spontaneous retinal activity. In all, the experiments in this proposal are designed to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the development of precise neural circuits in the mammalian brain, with a specific emphasis on the emergence of visual maps in the mouse superior colliculus."
"9468223","Project Summary In the US, one in seven adults has type 2 diabetes (T2D), and if current trends continue, it is projected that T2D prevalence can rise to as high as one in three adults by the year 2050. Furthermore, the burden of this health condition disproportionately affects US ethnic minorities; whereas the current T2D prevalence is 11% among Whites, it is 22% among Blacks and Hispanics. Obesity is a strong risk factor for T2D and part of this effect is hypothesized to be due to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the extent to which adiposity acts on the development of T2D through liver fat is unknown. Current race/ethnic-specific guidelines for the identification of obesity using body anthropometry (e.g. body mass index) are established for White and Asian populations. However, race/ethnic-specific guidelines are lacking for US Black and Hispanic populations, primarily because evidence has been limited to findings from cross-sectional studies. We propose to test the hypothesis that the obesity-T2D relationship will be evident at different clinically relevant anthropometric values among Blacks and Hispanics compared to Whites. In addition, we propose to estimate the mediating effect of liver fat on the association between anthropometry and T2D. The proposed investigation leverages the rich longitudinal data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a cohort study of 6,814 White, Black, Hispanic and Chinese adults that have been followed since the year 2000. Baseline data will identify obesity using several anthropometric measures, and to identify the degree of fatty liver using Computed Tomography scans. Individuals were followed for incident T2D in four subsequent follow-up exam visits. Proportional hazards regression will be used to estimate race-specific associations between anthropometry and incident T2D; multivariable linear regression analyses will be used to evaluate race- specific associations between anthropometric measurements and liver fat at baseline; and we will use inverse probability weighted proportional hazards regression to estimate the mediating effect of obesity on T2D through liver fat. Prior studies of the association of anthropometric measures and T2D in Black and Hispanic populations were limited by their cross-sectional study design, or lacked multi-ethnic groups to evaluate heterogeneity of the T2D risk between race/ethnic groups. In contrast, our proposal is innovative by evaluating this association in a large, well-characterized prospective cohort of multi-racial/ethnic groups. The significance of the proposal is reflected in the much higher prevalence of T2D in the understudied Black and Hispanic populations. The interdisciplinary training environment, expert mentorship in the fields of obesity and T2D epidemiology, health disparities and epidemiologic methods, will provide the applicant a platform in which he can strengthen his training goals and contribute to the field of chronic disease as a future independent researcher in T2D prevention epidemiology. !"
"9469743","PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are macromolecules that carry out innumerable biological functions ranging from intracellular signaling to immune response. The specific function of a protein is determined by its three-dimensional structure. Therefore, an essential step towards understanding protein function is elucidating protein structure. However, the premier method for structure determination, X-ray crystallography, can be limited by many potential factors including the quality of the protein crystal. The proposed research will investigate the effects of protein? protein interactions in the crystal lattice on crystal quality and resolution and develop a design approach to stabilize lattice interactions, which should result in higher-quality crystals.  First, the molecular determinants of high-quality protein crystal structures will be identified by (1) curating a set of representative structures from the Protein Data Bank, (2) extracting relevant features, such as interaction energy, buried solvent accessible surface area, interfacial packing quality, and residue usage, and (3) analyzing the features? relationship to crystal resolution (a proxy for quality). Based on these findings, a design strategy and score function for ranking designs within the Rosetta framework will be developed.  Second, the design strategy will be applied to SNase, a model protein that is easy to purify and well- behaved in crystallization and diffraction experiments. The designed proteins will be crystallized and the crystal structures will be solved, testing for improved resolution. Analysis of the resultant crystal structures will drive development of the design strategy.  Third, the design strategy will be applied on a bacterial gyrase, an antibiotic-target protein for which there are several drug-bound structures at low resolution, lacking sufficient detail to reveal key antibiotic? gyrase interactions. Preliminary data suggests that the designed gyrase mutants will yield high-resolution structures, permitting a better understanding of antibiotic?gyrase interactions, with implications for drug design.  Should the method be successful, it will be immediately applicable to ~26,000 structures in the Protein Data Bank, and countless structures that have not been published due to lack of resolution. Re-engineered, high-resolution structures of these proteins could yield structural data on molecular interactions pertinent to disease, drug development, and basic understanding of protein function."
"9604884","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     To date, the genetic analysis of extinct archaic hominins has required the isolation and sequencing of ancient DNA obtained from fossilized remains, which is technologically challenging and limited by the number of available specimens. However, the recent discovery that gene flow occurred between archaic groups, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, and anatomically modern humans suggests a fossil free approach for the sequencing of archaic genomes. To this end, the goals of the proposed project are to develop an innovative new paradigm for the genetic analysis of archaic human ancestors, whose DNA lives on in the genomes of modern humans. In Aim 1, we will develop novel and computationally efficient methods for identifying introgressed DNA sequences. These methods will not depend on the availability of an archaic reference sequence and will therefore facilitate the discovery of previously unknown archaic hominins, if such groups exchanged genes with modern humans. We will rigorously evaluate the power and false discovery rates of newly developed statistics through extensive coalescent simulations under a wide variety of demographic models and admixture scenarios. In Aim 2, we will leverage our access to several large-scale sequencing projects and apply these novel methods to whole-genome and exome sequences collected in over 11,000 geographically diverse individuals. We will also develop methods to comprehensively analyze the population genetics characteristics of the reconstructed archaic metagenomes and to test hypotheses such as the fitness effects of hybridization, sex-biased patterns of gene flow, and whether introgressed sequences have been subject to positive selection. The successful completion of the proposed project will extend our understanding of admixture events between archaic and modern humans, provide insight into how introgression has shaped extant patterns of human genomic diversity, and may facilitate the molecular discovery and characterization of previously unknown archaic groups that have contributed to the modern gene pool. Overall, we anticipate that fossil free sequencing of archaic genomes will be a significant advancement for the burgeoning field of paleogenomics, allowing genetic analyses that have heretofore not been possible."
"9633373","Gastrointestinal (GI) function is regulated by the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS contains all of the circuitry needed to regulate GI function but it does this in collaboration with information coming from visceral afferents, sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent neurons as well as being sensitive to neuromodulators released from the intestinal epithelium. A rich literature exists demonstrating the importance of these individual inputs for normal GI function, but until recently it has been difficult to investigate the connectome within the ENS or the connectivity between the ENS and its extrinsic inputs that might underlie pathological states. The first step in exploring the use of neuromodulation approaches to treating GI disease is elucidating the intrinsic and extrinsic connectome that allows the ENS to maintain gut homeostasis. To do this we propose to use electrophysiology, imaging, optogenetics, and molecular phenotyping to identify how ENS neurons communicate with each other, extrinsic sensory and autonomic neurons and the gut epithelium. This OT2 application follows successful competition of our OT1 application in response to RFA-RM-15-018 with the goal of developing a comprehensive functional map of neuroanatomy and neurobiology of the enteric neural circuits and associated extrinsic innervation. We will stimulate or monitor specific subsets of neurons based on chemical coding, electrophysiological membrane properties or synaptic components in new mouse models. The goal of generating a predictive functional and anatomical neural circuit map will be accomplished by the following specific aims: 1) Generate a dynamic anatomical map of the ENS circuitry, in genetically modified mice expressing the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6, ChR2 and/or fluorescent markers; 2) Generate a dynamic anatomical map of ENS intrinsic and extrinsic afferent circuits to determine how input from the epithelium and peripheral nervous system interfaces with the ENS in mice expressing optogenetic actuators/sensors, and 3) determine the molecular signature of mouse and human ENS neurons. Taking all anatomical and functional data together we will generate testable predictive mathematical models of ENS circuitry and its extrinsic innervation."
"9415458","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The heart is the first organ to develop, a process that involves multiple cell fate decisions and morphological processes. Key among these is the orientation of specific morphological events such as trabeculation and septation toward the heart lumen. Failure of these processes can result in congenital heart disease, a major cause of mortality and morbidity. The objective of this proposal is to identify the mechanism whereby atypical Protein Kinase C Iota (Prkci) and the downstream PAR polarity machinery direct myocardial polarization at the single cell and whole organ levels. The central hypothesis is that directional cues from the endocardium and cardiac jelly direct Prkci and the Par complex to orient the spindle apparatus and the cell division plane of luminal myocardial toward the heart lumen and propel trabecular formation. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory and is tested with three specific aims: 1) determine how Prkci directs cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation during ventricular trabeculation; 2) define the molecular mechanism through which Prkci controls the Par complex and the spindle machinery to regulate polarized cell division in luminal myocardial cells; and 3) define the non-cell autonomous inductive signaling cues that direct myocardial polarization. Under the first aim, single cell clonal analysis is performed to determine how Prkci directs oriented cell division. Highly innovative cell labeling and genome editing techniques are coupled with cutting-edge spectral confocal microscopy to define the role of Prkci-dependent polarized cell division in the initiation of trabeculation. In the second aim, the applicant determines how Prkci controls the downstream Par machinery and explores the potential of this pathway to direct polarized cell division in human stem cell derived myocytes. In the third aim, the applicant identifies the upstream inductive cues that feed into Prkci and its interacting partners and adapts the knowledge gained from developmental biology to stem cell biology. The rationale for these studies is that they are the first to address how the highly conserved PAR complex orients the mitotic spindle and axis of cell division to control myocardial alignment during in vivo cardiogenesis and in vitro cellular differentiation. The advent of stem cell based approaches to regenerative cardiology and the necessity of ensuring the proper cellular alignment of transplanted cells or constructs make this research highly significant. Thus, the overall impact of this project is to provide a mechanistic understanding of how the highly conserved Par machinery directs polarized cell division to control normal cardiac organogenesis. This study provides a fundamental understanding of a key morphological event in cardiac development that can be applied to regenerative cardiovascular medicine where it is necessary to expand the number of functional CMs and promote their alignment and cellular integration with the native myocardium."
"9431249","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that is caused by an expansion of CAG triplet repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The expanded CAG repeats in the mutant HTT gene are translated into a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that confers a deleterious gain of function on the mutant protein. The structurally altered mutant (m)HTT interacts with and inactivates critical factors; loss of function of these factors disrupts transcription of specific genes, synaptic function, calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial dynamics and energetics in HD. Additionally, accumulation of DNA damage and aberrant activation of DNA damage-response (DDR) ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) signaling is also implicated in the HD pathomechanism. Notwithstanding these discoveries defining the underlying disease mechanisms, the early instigating processes by which mHTT induces these pathological changes and drives functional decline and neuronal loss remain unknown. This knowledge gap is a major rate-limiting step in developing a targeted therapeutic strategy to prevent neurological decline in HD; due to this limitation this degenerative illness remains untreatable and invariably fatal. In an important step forward, we have discovered that the normal HTT recruits polynucleotide kinase 3' phosphatase (PNKP), a major DNA strand break repair enzyme; ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a deubiquitinating enzyme; and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to form a transcription-dependent multi- protein DNA repair complex likely to be involved in the repair of actively transcribing genes. In contrast, mHTT disrupts the functional integrity of this repair complex and abrogates PNKP activity, resulting in DNA strand break accumulation to stimulate a pathogenic surge of DNA damage-response signaling in HD. The overall objective of this project is to characterize the molecular interactions by which mHTT impairs the enzymatic activities of PNKP and ATXN3, perturbs repair of the actively transcribed genes, and contributes to HD pathomechanism so that we can ultimately develop a preventive therapy for this terminal disease. These studies are designed to provide a mechanistic basis for neurodegeneration in HD and uncover the critical role of DNA repair therein. Aim 1 should confirm that mHTT alters the functional integrity of the transcription coupled repair complex, and inactivates PNKP to induce DNA strand breaks in the actively transcribing genes in HD. These studies should thus provide important insights into how polyQ expansion interferes with a specific DNA repair machinery to induce nuclear and mtDNA damage in HD. Aim 2 will provide critical mechanistic insights into how mHTT triggers pro-apoptotic stimuli to cause neurotoxicity in HD. Aim 3 will test the effectiveness of PNKP overexpression in the mutant cells and in HD transgenic mouse model in decreasing DNA lesions, preventing or slowing down DDR pathway activation in HD. These studies should confirm that mutant HTT-mediated impairment of neuronal DNA repair contributes to neurotoxicity in HD, and identify proximal molecular targets to develop mechanism-based therapeutic strategies for HD."
"9633004","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebrovascular disease, most notably brain ischemia, is a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the US. The current and only treatment is prompt restoration of blood flow to the ischemic tissue. However, a substantial portion of the damage caused by ischemia/reperfusion occurs during the reperfusion phase: as ischemic tissue is reoxygenated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are quickly generated, starting early during reflow. Reperfusion injury has proved difficult to treat pharmacologically, likely because effective drug concentrations have not built up sufficiently during the early phase of reperfusion. The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is a major site of ROS production during cellular stress due to ETC hyper-activation, which causes high mitochondrial membrane potentials (??m), which in turn trigger excessive ROS production. We thus propose that the ideal therapy should target the ETC non-invasively to prevent the generation of ROS from the onset of reflow. Accordingly, our overall goal in this application is to develop a new, non-invasive therapy to normalize mitochondrial hyperactivity during reflow. We will capitalize on the photoreceptive properties of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) for infrared light (IRL) to modulate mitochondrial activity, thereby attenuating the production of ROS and, as a result, limit ischemia/reperfusion injury in the brain. Cytochrome c oxidase is the primary cellular photo-acceptor of IRL and the terminal enzyme of the ETC. We have discovered four specific IRL wavelengths that partially inhibit COX (instead of activating COX, i.e., the current paradigm). We show that inhibitory IRL, applied at the time of reperfusion, provides profound neuroprotection. In this proposal, we will build on these compelling preliminary data and capitalize on the unique, multi-disciplinary expertise of our research team to: Identify the combinations and energies of our four IRL wavelengths that yield  optimal inhibition of COX and mitochondria in vitro using isolated rat brain COX and mitochondria (Aim 1). Investigate the mechanism of IRL-mediated protection in support of our central hypothesis of IRL action during reperfusion: IRL ? COX activity? ? ??m? ?  ROS? ? viability?, using real-time imaging of mitochondrial funtion in rat primary neural cells exposed to simulated ischemia-reperfusion (Aim 2). Develop IRL-mediated protection and identify the optimal temporal treatment  paradigm using a rat model for global brain ischemia to maximize post-ischemic neuroprotection (Aim 3)."
"9415419","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a potent human carcinogen found in the workplace of more than 0.5 million individuals in the US. Environmental exposure to Cr(VI) also represents a significant public health concern due to the presence of this metal in drinking water for millions of US households and at many Superfund toxic sites. Intracellular reduction of Cr(VI) results in the formation of a wide assortment of DNA lesions, including several forms of Cr-DNA adducts. We have previously found that Cr-DNA binding was responsible for all mutagenic and genotoxic effects generated by direct metabolism of Cr(VI) with its main biological reducers. The genotoxicity of Cr-DNA adducts was unexpected considering their very weak duplex-distorting properties reflecting attachment of Cr atom to the DNA phosphate group. Cr(VI) also causes very toxic, cancer-promoting DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) that is detectable at environmentally relevant Cr(VI) doses and poorly repaired. This application, which is built on our previously published findings and new preliminary data, is designed to investigate a mechanism of DSB formation via toxic DNA repair of Cr-DNA adducts. The proposed studies aim to identify specific forms of Cr-DNA damage that trigger toxic DNA repair and DSB formation, characterize nuclease activities involved in DNA strand cleavage and determine genomic host-spots for DNA breakage and DNA repair processes. A successful completion of this work can help identify toxicologically important biomarkers of Cr(VI) exposure and high-risk genomic sites that can be used for monitoring of genetic damage in exposed populations."
"9557985","Abstract Despite the advent of biological therapies, glucocorticoids (GCs) remain the most widely prescribed medicines for the management of inflammatory diseases such as lupus, asthma, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, long term and high dose GC use is inevitably accompanied by systemic toxicity. There are no adjunctive therapies that could enhance the disease modifying effects of GCs at low doses thus minimizing their dose-dependent toxicity. The long-term product goal of this Phase I SBIR project is a small molecule GC adjunct that will enable an efficacious GC regimen at non-toxic doses. To accomplish this goal, we propose an innovative strategy to improve GC responsiveness by blocking macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a proinflammatory cytokine known for its ability to antagonize GC action. We will block MIF function using a novel family of small molecule MIF inhibitors and a MIF-specific monoclonal antibody and evaluate the therapeutic effect of this blockade in restoring GC response in a GC-resistant autoimmune disease model. For the purpose of this study, we have already developed a unique mouse model of autoimmune disease that is refractory to GC treatment. In this model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the rodent equivalent of multiple sclerosis, we discovered that female mice develop fulminant and lethal disease despite GC treatment, and that disease progression can be effectively halted by neutralizing MIF activity. Building from this observation, we have developed a rigorous experimental plan to interrogate the therapeutic effect of MIF inhibition in restoring GC responsiveness in the EAE mice. The achievable milestone for this Phase I SBIR project is efficacy evaluation of two novel small molecule MIF inhibitors and one MIF-specific monoclonal antibody in restoring GC response in the GC-resistant EAE mice. The scientific premise of this study is based on a vast body of literature on the interactions between MIF and GCs, and the relevance of this regulatory dyad in contributing to clinical resistance to GC therapy. A successful outcome of this study will lay the foundation for further pre-clinical development of a novel and `first-in-class' adjunctive therapy that would enable prolonged use of lower and non-toxic doses of GCs in autoimmune patients."
"9412870","PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this proposal is to combine functional mutagenesis, biochemistry, and structural biology, to understand the molecular architecture of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter. Early biochemical studies demonstrated that isolated mitochondria could transport and buffer huge amounts of Ca2+ across their inner membrane via a highly selective, Ru360-sensitive channel called the ?uniporter?. Uptake of Ca2+ via the uniporter is known to activate the TCA cycle, while its overload leads to cell death. Although the uniporter has been studied extensively for over 50 years, its molecular identity remained elusive until our group utilized comparative genomics to discover its molecular components. In humans, the minimal genetic elements required for uniporter current are MCU (the pore forming protein) and EMRE (a single-pass membrane protein). We have recently shown that Dictyostelium discoideum harbors a simpler uniporter, requiring only one component (DdMCU, the homolog of MCU), which is necessary and sufficient for uniporter activity and complements the requirement for MCU or EMRE in human knockout cells. At present, the molecular basis for the uniporter?s selectivity, mechanistic basis for inhibition by Ru360, and why the animal uniporter requires EMRE are unclear. Recently, we have solved the NMR structure of the channel-forming region of MCU using a N-Terminal Domain (NTD) truncated but fully functional construct from C. elegans, named cMCU-?NTD. The structure, which represents a new architecture for Ca2+ channel, provides the much-needed framework for addressing the above questions. Aims 1 and 2 will use DdMCU, which is active by itself, to address the open state of MCU, whereas Aims 3 and 4 will focus on animal MCU and EMRE, to address the mechanism of how EMRE activates the MCU channel. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform systematic but hypothesis- driven mutagenesis of DdMCU to identify key residues important for the function and pharmacologic properties of this channel. In Aim 2, we will determine the structure of DdMCU using independent structural approaches including crystallography, EM, and NMR. In Aim 3, we will investigate the biochemistry and topology of EMRE and perform systematic mutagenesis to identify protein regions critical for MCU-EMRE interaction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will investigate Ca2+ and Ru360 binding to MCU using the cMCU-?NTD NMR system, and perform biochemical and structural characterization of MCU-EMRE interaction, including solving the high resolution structure of EMRE alone in lipid bilayer. The proposed studies will yield deep insights into the molecular architecture and mechanisms of the uniporter that promise to have implications for a range of human diseases."
"9433942","OVERALL ABSTRACT Human astroviruses (HAstV) are a leading cause of infectious diarrhea. Yet, the current ?gold-standard? diagnostic test fails to detect 2/3 of the HAstV genotypes associated with human infection making it likely that HAstV infection is not only under-diagnosed, but more prevalent than appreciated. There has also been an increased appreciation that HAstV disease can range from asymptomatic to significant and even fatal systemic diseases beyond diarrhea including encephalitis and meningitis, particularly in high-risk populations suggesting that astrovirus-associated diarrheal disease is also not as straight-forward as dogma would have us believe. Yet, the role for distinct HAstV genotypes in disease is currently unknown and no studies to date have defined the host or viral factors connected with astroviral-associated diarrheal disease. Our proposed studies begin to fill this gap in knowledge by being the first work aimed at understanding HAstV-associated diarrhea: from epidemiology to basic virology. Strong preliminary studies suggest that diverse viral genotypes co-circulate in pediatric oncology patients with boys being four times more likely to be infected than girls, and that viruses isolated from patients have distinct in vitro phenotypes. Thus, the overall goals of our planned studies are to begin to understand HAstV-associated diarrhea in a novel high-risk population. Our central hypothesis is that the ability of astroviruses to cause diarrheal illness is largely mediated by their broad heterogeneity and distinct biological behaviors. To test our central hypothesis, we have proposed the following three interconnected but independent specific aims:  1. Understand the association between astrovirus infection and diarrheal disease.  2. Determine if diarrheal disease correlates with in vitro phenotypes.  3. Are there additional HAstV genotypes? We are uniquely suited to undertake this work given our expertise in astrovirus biology as well as having novel cohorts of pediatric oncology patients that are among the highest risk for having astrovirus infections with access to extensive metadata including onset/presence of diarrheal disease. Importantly, we have already demonstrated that our cohorts are infected with genotypes from all 3 clades, and now we will be able to determine their association with diarrheal disease. Intriguingly, there appears to be a sex bias with males more likely to be HAstV-positive. Extensive new genomic information will be generated that will be invaluable to many investigators. In the long term, these studies may reveal critical new information on the public health impact of viral enteric infections."
"9521812","The prognosis for pancreatic cancer patients remains dismal. Effective therapy is clearly an unmet medical need for these patients. Aside from surgery which benefits a small fraction of patients, current standard treatment consists of strong chemotherapy that is highly toxic and with less than 50% chance of working. For those who initially benefit from chemotherapy, rapid progression is inevitable. The promise of immunotherapy, while already realized in other cancer types, has failed to show benefit for pancreatic cancer patients. Therapeutic breakthrough must therefore come from novel discoveries in the biology of pancreatic cancer. We now recently found, for the first time in literature, that pancreatic cancer cells ?armored? themselves by activating the innate immunity, a self-defense mechanism that is usually summoned when cells are injured or invaded by microorganisms. In doing so pancreatic cancer cells become highly aggressive and resistant to chemotherapeutics. Our approach is to ?deactivate? such defense mechanism in pancreatic cancer cells by inhibiting Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase 4 (IRAK4), the master switch that controls the innate immune pathway. By doing so we found that pancreatic cancer cells become greatly weakened and are much more vulnerable to chemotherapy. On this premise we have now made further potentially impactful findings that we plan to confirm and pursue in the following three aims:  1. Aim 1: We found that presence of IRAK4 is essential for supporting transformed growth and cellular  signaling driven by oncogenic KRAS, a genetic event that is present in almost all pancreatic cancer. We  will explore the mechanistic detail and determine whether loss of IRAK4 will impede KRAS-driven  pancreatic tumorigenesis using human pancreatic cancer cell lines and state-of-the-art genetic mouse  models. If shown to be true, these results could have impact on other KRAS-mutant cancer types.  2. Aim 2: We have generated an IRAK4-deficient pancreatic cancer mouse model that we plan to  characterize to understand the consequence of global IRAK4 loss, as will happen with pharmacologic  inhibition, in pancreatic cancer progression. In addition, we will specifically study the role of immune  IRAK4 in pancreatic cancer growth, which will yield clinically useful information if IRAK4 inhibitors are  advanced into clinical trials in the future.  3. Aim 3: Our preliminary data shows that IRAK4 inhibition renders immunotherapy effective in genetic  mouse model. In this aim we will test two novel, highly potent IRAK4 inhibitors, with the ultimate goal of  translating these findings into clinical trials."
"9624487","PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large ?real world? community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator."
"9415469","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing the influence of pollutants on genome function is essential in defining their impact on human health. Arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental toxic metalloid that leads to carcinogenesis. The World Health Organization estimates that over 100 million people worldwide are at risk to drinking arsenic contaminated water. Recent studies indicate that arsenic alters gene expression leading to tumorigenesis. Proper gene regulation is essential for normal growth, development and etiology of diseases such as cancer. Eukaryotic DNA stored as chromatin whose basic repeating unit is the nucleosome, plays an integral role in gene regulation. Previously, we (and others) showed that nucleosome locations within promoters play critical roles in chromatin accessibility, thus controlling gene activity. Consequently, chromatin accessibility is an essential component in gene regulation yet is not fully understood. Chromatin accessibility appears to be modulated by several key epigenetic factors: histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), DNA methylation, nucleosome position/occupancy, transcription factors and chromatin architectural proteins (CAPs). Recent studies now indicate that changes in DNA methylation and histone PTMs influence gene expression in response to arsenic: Thus it is critically important to understand how these key epigenetic modulators integrate and interrelate to regulate the chromatin state and gene expression during arsenic exposure. This project will determine the functional changes in gene regulation, chromatin composition, structure and dynamics genome-wide due to arsenic in normal and iAs- transformed cells. We hypothesize that iAs-induced alterations in nucleosome position and occupancy, histone PTMs, and CAP occupancy all combine to dynamically restructure chromatin resulting in differential expression of key genes resulting in a failure to ensure proper gene regulation and cancer. We propose in this application the following Specific Aims: (1) determine the effect of iAs on in vivo nucleosome positioning and/occupancy during iAs-induced transformation. (2) Determine the impact of iAs- triggered modulation of CAPs-chromatin structure to impact gene expression. (3) Determine the mechanisms whereby iAs-provoked changes in chromatin composition, structure and dynamics control TF occupancy. Our interdisciplinary, broad approach will establish unique comprehensive functional and mechanistic data that will provide a detailed understanding of the interplay between arsenic-induced epigenetic changes and chromatin in the mammalian cell. We have developed novel systems that will provide an unprecedented and unique opportunity to discover the functional and mechanistic roles of the epigenome in toxin-induced diseases."
"9486377","Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry)."
"9557882","Project Summary  Filoviruses cause severe hemorrhagic fevers and are among the deadliest human viruses with no approved treatment or prophylactic options. Periodic outbreaks, such as the recent epidemic of Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa, exhibit mortality rates ranging from 50-90%. They are classified as ?Category A priority bioweapon agents? by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most advanced candidates for anti-filovirus therapy with proven efficacy in non-human primates (NHPs) utilize RNA interference (RNAi), high dose mixtures of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), or repurposed influenza, herpes or hepatitis C inhibitors. Although they represent important advances, these approaches have serious limitations including the high therapeutic doses required (20-30 g of mAb/patient), limited spectrum (primarily Zaire strain) and/or narrow therapeutic windows (small molecules/RNAi).  Building on recent work demonstrating the critical nature of endosomal interactions between the filoviral glycoprotein (GP) and the host cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) for filoviral entry, we have developed small molecules and antibodies that disrupt this mechanism to inhibit viral entry. These include several bispecific GP-targetomg pan-ebolavirus broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) efficacious in multiple animal models, with down-selection to a final cocktail based on NHP efficacy underway. In parallel, we identified an NPC1-binding phenylpiperazine (MBX-3587), which inhibits the GP-NPC1 interaction to block infection by virulent EBOV and MARV at low to sub µM concentrations in vitro, demonstrates excellent PK/PD properties, exhibits excellent murine tolerability, has established efficacy in mice, and is currently being optimized for a targeted IND. In this proposal we will tether MBX-3587 to bispecific pan-ebola bNABs to target broad-spectrum antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that synergistically inhibit viral entry.  The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate that these ADCs will provide improved efficacy and selectivity for filovirus treatment over either agent alone, providing highly efficacious pan-ebola agents, broadening the therapeutic window and easing drug stockpiling efforts. We will accomplish this objective through three specific aims: In Aim 1 we will synthesize and complete physical characterization of >40 ADCs demonstrating serum stability with efficient endosomal release. In Aim 2 we will prioritize ADCs through in vitro analysis of pan-ebola inhibitory activity. In Aim 3 we prioritize ADCs for PK and toxicity and evaluate two pan- ebola ADCs for in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of EBOV infection."
"9508705","ABSTRACT  Zika virus (ZIKV) is linked to microcephaly and other birth defects, and thus the emerging epidemic of ZIKV in the Americas poses significant health threats. Despite the considerable impact of ZIKV infection on world-wide health, no antiviral therapies are available, and existing flavivirus vaccines are of limited utility. Our long-term goal is to obtain detailed structural and biochemical information regarding ZIKV replication and to use this information for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. In particular, the ZIKV RNA genome contains a stem loop A (SLA) at the 5'-end that acts as a promoter element for the viral polymerase NS5 to initiate RNA synthesis. Thus, the structural information on ZIKV SLA and its interaction with ZIKV NS5 will be essential to understand the mechanism of NS5-mediated initiation of RNA replication. Knowledge of the mechanism by which the polymerase recognizes the SLA promoter will additionally identify potential therapeutic targets, and suggest strategies for intervention against ZIKV replication. Our goals of the project are to characterize the interaction site between ZIKV NS5 and SLA using binding assays (Aim 1) and determine the structure of ZIKV SLA by a combination of our pRNA fusion technique and cryo-electron microscopy (Aim 2). Because SLA and NS5 interaction is essential for viral replication, RNA decoys that bind NS5 specifically may inhibit ZIKV replication. We will thus identify structural features in SLA that are conserved among flaviviruses, and design SLA decoys as potential ZIKV inhibitors."
"9417601","OVERALL ? PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of the ENCORE (Encyclopedia of RNA Elements) Consortium is to develop a foundational, functional map of protein-RNA interactions of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) encoded in the human genome, and the RNA elements they bind to across the transcriptome. These RNA elements, when expressed, form the basis of co- and post-transcriptional regulation of human genes. Our strategy consists of developing and integrating a physical map of 300 RBPs in two different human cell lines with transcriptome-wide measurements of the effects of depleting these RBPs, their localization patterns and their binding preferences independent of co-factor associations. Over the past 4 years, our consortium (Burge, Graveley, Lecuyer and Yeo) has established highly efficient data production workflows of experimental methods (RNA bind-n-seq, RNA-seq, Localization and enhanced CLIP) that will enable us to immediately expand these datasets, which form a crucial and missing link to decipher the mechanisms of post-trancriptional regulation and how these impact genetic variation and disease etiology. When combined with the data we generated over the past four years, these efforts will culminate in a comprehensive map of the functional RNA elements recognized by essentially all RBPs expressed in two human cell lines, representing approximately half of the known complement of human RBPs. ENCORE will (1) generate and validate a physical resource of cell lines expressing epitope-tagged RBPs, (2) develop transcriptomics and imaging databases of these RBPs to provide simple interfaces for the community to mine this resource, (3) develop and distribute workflows for integrative analyses and shareable results from these workflows and (4) provide training and outreach to establish ENCORE annotations as the standard reference for co- and post-transcriptional research and clinical genomics efforts in the long-term."
"9643880","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the most common cause of death in the US. CVD currently claims nearly one million lives yearly in the U.S., accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths. The total cost of CVD in the U.S., including hospitalizations and lost productivity, is approximately $300 billion annually. Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for the largest number of deaths and the majority of these costs. While the efforts aimed at treating this disease in recent decades have concentrated on surgical and catheter-based interventions, limited resources have been directed toward prevention and rehabilitation. Over the last decade, the use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has increased exponentially. Between 1996 and 2007, the number of PCIs performed in the U.S. increased more than 4-fold, from approximately 300,000 to more than 1.3 million yearly. During this time, PCI has accounted for 10% of the overall increase in Medicare expenditures. In light of the extraordinary increase in the use of this technology in recent years, questions have been raised regarding the cost-effectiveness of PCI, the extent to which PCI is overused, and whether selected patients may benefit from optimal medical therapy in lieu of PCI. Despite the fact that PCI is expensive, repeat PCI is common and there is no evidence for improved survival, alternative therapies are rarely considered. One alternative therapy that has been shown to improve outcomes in PCI candidates is exercise training. In the PCI vs. Exercise Training (Leipzig) study, PCI candidates randomized to one year of exercise training had improved coronary anatomy, higher exercise capacity, an improvement in quality of life and event-free survival, as well as lower health care costs when compared to the PCI group. However, the Leipzig study employed invasive angiographic methods which do not provide information on dynamic coronary flow or atherosclerosis specifically, and do not provide insight into the mechanism of atherosclerosis progression or regression. In addition, economic analyses were limited to cost per change in Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class; the Leipzig study did not assess cost effectiveness. Given the high volume of PCI, its high cost, its lack of effect on survival and the potential for alternative treatments including exercise and risk reduction in PCI candidates, the current proposal is termed PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise (PAUSE). The primary aim of PAUSE is apply newer imaging technologies to determine whether patients randomized to an exercise program have greater improvement in coronary function and anatomy compared to those randomized to PCI. Both groups will receive optimal medical management. We will also compare health care costs, symptoms, quality of life, and clinical outcomes between the two groups. At baseline and one year after randomization, patients will undergo an assessment of physical activity patterns and fitness using standardized questionnaires and maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). Patients will also undergo a detailed evaluation of coronary function and anatomy with positron emission tomography combined with computed tomographic angiography (PET/CTA). PET will be used to measure myocardial perfusion and endothelial function. CTA will be used to evaluate anatomical progression of atherosclerotic disease based on a qualitative scoring system and quantitative measurement of calcified and noncalcified plaque burden. The combination of PET/CTA provides information that previously could only be obtained invasively using coronary flow wires and invasive x-ray angiography. This will permit a noninvasive way to evaluate both functional and anatomical adaptations to exercise. Our overall objective is to demonstrate the utility of a non-invasive technology to document the efficacy of exercise as an alternative treatment strategy to PCI for coronary lesions."
"9557448","PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to build a cloud-based integrated solution for scalable, customizable, privacy-preserving, and interactive antibody repertoire analysis. Immune repertoire sequencing (IR-seq) has become a useful tool in both basic research and clinical settings. As the heart of the adaptive immunity to infection and many vaccines, the abundance and diversity composition of the B cell receptor (BCR) and its dynamic changes in health and diseases bear information of how to evaluate immune health, perform disease diagnosis and prognosis, and measure vaccination effect. However, there is a computational bottleneck for large scale antibody lineage construction, a lack of decomposable pipeline modules that preserve privacy and ownership, and a missing gap for interactive linage analysis and visualization. In this Phase I grant, we will (1) break the bottlenecks of pipeline processing and scale up the core algorithms to handle large sequence data sets; (2) protect private data and proprietary processing algorithms with modularized pipeline, integrated cloud-local processing, and data perturbation methods; 3) develop end-to-end web services for pipeline composition and interactive analysis visualization in a cloud-based deployment solution. Existing commercial efforts are mostly focusing on cancer related IR-seq analysis aiming to trace the disappearing of cancer cells after therapy, which solely focus on cataloging sequence species and abundance. This kind of analysis is much simpler and easier, compared to analyzing IR-seq data in infection and vaccination. Providing insights on host immune responses is a much more challenging but much needed task. Once the pipeline is built, it can be readily adapted to analyze cancer IR-seq data. Also, existing algorithms and optimizations that have been developed for other big data analysis can be further developed and applied to the IR-seq data analysis. We will use a publically available BCR repertoire data on an influenza vaccination cohort and a TCR repertoire data on an aging cohort to test the feasibility of the project. The long term goal of this proposal is to build cloud based accessible and customizable services for experts as well as non-specialists. We aim to provide an integrated solution for the ingestion, processing, analysis, exploration and visualization, interpretation and sharing of data generated by deep sequencing of full length antibody and TCR repertoire. The success of this Phase I SBIR will provide a solid foundation for the product launch of a commercial cloud based solution in Phase II, during which we will continue our investigation on big data security and privacy to facilitate compliance with institutional policies and design and develop programmable APIs and tools to facilitate integrations with more third party modules and services."
"9614010","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment of Co-Occurring Alcohol Use Disorders and Depression/Anxiety Disorders highlight the need, recognized by the NIAAA, to identify new targets/drugs for the treatment of alcoholism and its co- morbidities. Naltrexone a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist is one of the few therapeutics currently used in the treatment of alcoholism, validating the opioid receptor system as a relevant target for alcohol abuse. However, naltrexone shows highly variable eficacy in treatment seeking alcoholics and is plagued by side effects and consequent lack of compliance of use. We propose that the non-selective nature of naltrexone may be contributing to the variable efficacy and/or the side effects that limit compliance. Here, we propose to examine specifically the role of the delta opioid receptor (DOR) subtypes, DOR1 and DOR2 in alcohol related behaviors. We are particularly intrigued by the DOR as a target because it is involved in both alcohol consumption and anxiety, which is often co-morbid with alcohol abuse and is a key risk factor for relapse. In our preliminary studies we have found that drugs that target the DOR1 and DOR2 subtypes of opioid receptor have opposing effects on ethanol consumption. In addition, we have found that an antagonist at DOR2 and an agonist at DOR1 can act synergistically to reduce ethanol consumption clearly indicating that these two receptor subtypes are distinct targets with opposing actions. We also have preliminary evidence that the DOR1 may be a heterodimer of the DOR and the mu opioid receptor (MOR). In this proposal, we will examine which commercially available DOR ligands are effective for the reduction of ethanol consumption and ethanol withdrawal induced anxiety. We will also examine whether prolonged ethanol exposure alters the potency and/or efficacy of the DOR ligands, in particular the subtype selective ligands. As a third goal, we will determine whether the effects of any of the DOR drugs require expression of the other opioid receptors, in particular the MOR which could indicate that they target a DOR/MOR heterodimer to exert their effects. Together, these studies may validate the DOR as a target for alcohol abuse disorders, indentify the pharmacological profile of the most ideal ligands for alcohol abuse disorders, and perhaps provide in vivo relevance for the MOR/DOR heterodimer as a target."
"9505284","Despite the discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) over 100 years ago and the availability of effective drugs for over 60 years, there remain formidable hurdles for controlling tuberculosis (TB) disease including the lack of a highly efficacious vaccine, long drug treatment regimens, prevention of infection, and killing dormant bacilli within macrophages. After close contact with a person with pulmonary TB, most people develop latent Mtb infection (LTBI). However, some individuals are naturally resistant to infection (RSTRs). The mechanisms of resistance are unknown and may provide insight into novel therapeutic strategies. In a large TB household contact study in urban Uganda over the past 20 years, we found that ~9% of close adult household contacts remained persistently TST and Interferon-? Release Assay (IGRA) negative during extended follow-up. To our knowledge, this large Ugandan cohort is unique with rigorous longitudinal clinical and epidemiologic data. Using genome-wide profiling of mRNA isolated from Mtb-infected peripheral blood- derived monocytes, we compared transcriptional signatures in the RSTR and LTBI groups. We found that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) gene family distinguishes RSTRs from LTBIs and may regulate resistance to Mtb infection. HDACs regulate transcription and some family members mediate the innate immune response to microbes. We also found polymorphisms in HDAC1 that are associated with resistance to infection. In peripheral blood monocyte-derived and alveolar macrophages, HDAC inhibitor treatment decreased Mtb replication in comparison to untreated cells. These findings support the concept that RSTRs have protective innate immune responses that are monocyte-dependent. However, several critical questions need to be addressed including elucidation of the molecular and genetic mechanisms of HDAC-mediated control of Mtb replication in macrophages and clinical resistance to Mtb infection. In addition, the role of alveolar macrophages in regulating HDAC-mediated immune responses is poorly understood. We hypothesize that HDACs mediate resistance to infection by inhibiting Mtb replication through transcriptional regulation of anti- microbial pathways. Characterization of HDAC-dependent immune responses will enable identification of natural resistance mechanisms to Mtb infection. The latter will provide new insight into our understanding of TB pathogenesis, point to novel approaches to TB vaccine and drug development, and identify biomarkers of resistance to and/or clearance of Mtb infection. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence."

"9521375","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injury to the renal proximal tubular epithelium (PTE) represents the underlying cause for acute kidney injury (AKI) following exposure to various stresses including ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and nephrotoxins. Kidney cells possess intrinsic mechanisms that can be activated to protect their survival under stress conditions. Facilitating repair of PTE cells will have beneficial effects in the treatment of AKI; however, the knowledge gap in understanding the mechanisms associated with repair of injury to these cells has been a setback in the development of novel therapies for AKI. Our group previously identified MG53, a novel member of the TRIM family protein, as an essential component of the cell membrane repair machinery. Although native MG53 protein is predominantly expressed in striated muscles, it is also present in the kidney particularly in PTE cells at a low, but significant concentration. PTE cells derived from the Mg53-/- mice are more vulnerable to membrane injury than normal cells, a phenotype that is also observed in striated muscles, suggesting that MG53 contributes to repair of renal epithelial cells. Compared with wild type mice, the Mg53-/- mice develop renal disorder and are more susceptible to I/R- induced AKI. We found that the recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein can cross the glomeruli and target to injury sites on PTE cells to facilitate the renal protective effect against various stresses. Intravenous administration of rhMG53 could protect I/R and cisplatin-induced injury to the kidney in rodent models. These data suggest that upregulating the MG53-mediated repair mechanism in PTE cells may be beneficial in preventing AKI and treating established AKI. Since native MG53 is present in circulation, systemic administration of rhMG53 would be unlikely to induce an immune response, and potentially be a safe biologic approach for treatment of AKI. The long-term goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that MG53 contributes to maintenance of renal function under physiological conditions, and targeting MG53-mediated repair of injury to PTE cells represents an effective means for prevention and treatment of AKI. Two specific aims are proposed: a) to elucidate the mechanism for MG53-mediated membrane repair in maintenance of renal function under physiological and AKI conditions; and b) to conduct proof-of-concept studies on rhMG53- based therapy for prevention or treatment of AKI. Fulfillment of these studies should advance our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the protection of renal cells from stress-induced injuries, and help development of novel therapies for prevention and treatment of AKI."

"9430441","PROJECT SUMMARY . Mitochondria play a pivotal role in regulating cardiac function in health and disease by regulating energy balance, biosynthetic processes, and cellular survival. Mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis are maintained in part through fusion and fission of mitochondria as well as through autophagic clearance or mitophagy of damaged mitochondria. Disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis has been closely linked to a host of acquired and genetic disease states, characterized by cardiomyocyte death at the cell level and overt cardiac dysfunction at a systemic level. Thus, clearly a thorough understanding of the molecular regulators of mitochondrial homeostasis in the heart is critical for reducing cardiac dysfunction related mortality. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase, Mulan, is a novel regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in mammalian hearts. Mulan participates in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and function. While Parkin, a cytoplasmic E3 ligase, has been extensively studied in mitophagy, Mulan's proposed role as a mitochondrial injury sensor, mediator of mitophagy, and inducer of cell death is both novel and a significant departure from the current state of understanding in the field. Given that Mulan is upregulated in Parkin null mouse hearts, we postulate that Mulan's upregulation may serve to compensate for the loss of Parkin, thus maintaining the basal cardiac function of Parkin null mice. Employing state-of-the-art techniques, we will investigate the intricacies of protein-protein and protein-substrate interactions by Mulan as well as how modulation of Mulan's expression fundamentally alters mitochondrial dynamics. Ultimately, our data may provide the first glimpse of an unrecognized, yet significant role of Mulan as a ?resident mitochondrial injury-sensor? in the heart. Furthermore, we intend to define the distinct contribution of Mulan in mitophagy, that is independent from Parkin, as well as Mulan's role in mitochondrial function, dynamics, and cell death in the heart. Given the emerging importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac pathology, the findings from our proposal will help define the role of Mulan as a key mitochondrial injury-sensor. In addition, the proposed studies will have broad implications for the understanding and treatment of heart disease."
"9524596","Abstract Our past research has provided considerable insight into the signals elicited through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate RhoA on astrocytes and in 1321N1 glioblastoma cells. The pathways regulated through PAR1 and S1P receptors via G?12/13 engagement include RhoA activation to increase cell proliferation, survival, and invasion-hallmarks of cancer. Our recent studies demonstrate robust activation of the transcriptional co-activators MRTF-A and YAP through RhoA signaling in glioblastoma cells, and implicate altered gene expression in proliferative and migratory responses. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate that robust transcriptional gene programs elicited through RhoA signaling are critical to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor growth and maintenance of glioblastoma stem cells (GSC), with a long term goal of identifying new therapeutic targets for this devastating disease. Aim #1 uses the human 1321N1 glioblastoma cell line to define cellular events and identify changes in specific target genes by which GPCRs and RhoA engage transcriptional pathways that contribute to cancer-relevant cellular responses. S1P- and thrombin-induced proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, invasion and angiogenesis are assessed in WT and MRTF-A or YAP CRISPR/Cas9 KO cells. Data from RNA seq analysis are used to identify critical regulated genes, and tested for their functional importance in cellular responses. Actions of target genes on, autocrine and transcriptional pathways that amplify response to GPCRs and RhoA are considered. Aim #2 uses patient-derived glioblastoma xenografts (PDX), as a model of glioblastoma stem cells. Several PDX lines will be grown in serum free medium in vitro as neurospheres or adherent cultures and subsequently implanted as orthotopic (brain) xenografts... YAP, MRTF-A, RhoA and their downstream target genes will be knocked down using shRNA and in vitro stem cell markers, cellular responses and in vivo tumor growth assessed. Aim #3 tests the hypothesis that RhoA-mediated transcriptional signaling leads to astrocyte dedifferentiation and gliomagenesis driven by activated Ras). Proof of principle experiments examine dedifferentiation of isolated mouse astrocytes infected with lentiviruses encoding oncogenic Ras and in which molecules in the RhoA signaling pathway are genetically deleted or knocked down with shRNAs. In vivo studies of gliomagenesis are carried out by delivery of oncogenes by lentiviral infection into the hippocampus of GFAP-Cre mice followed by analysis of tumor growth, invasion, and changes in expression of target genes and stem cell markers. The overall findings from these studies should demonstrate that GPCR- and RhoA-mediated transcriptional activation can elicit genetic and functional responses that contribute to dysregulation in glioblastoma, and that RhoA signaling contributes to the oncogenic effect of established GBM tumor drivers. The health-related significance is that these findings could shift the focus of current research and clinical practice from the established disease drivers towards consideration of GPCR- and RhoA-regulated signaling pathways in GBM."
"9434295","Abstract It is increasingly clear that people with schizophrenia have a range of visual perception impairments, including in low-level vision (e.g., acuity, contrast sensitivity) and mid-level vision (e.g., perceptual organization, coherent motion detection). These impairments are significantly related to poorer performance on cognitive (e.g., visual learning and memory) and social cognitive (e.g., facial emotion decoding) measures, and to worse functional outcomes. To date, there is no accepted technique for visual remediation for schizophrenia, and almost no work has been done in this area. However, visual remediation is a well-developed subfield within cognitive rehabilitation for TBI patients, and initial studies of short-term visual perceptual learning in schizophrenia indicate that plasticity exists that could support longer-term changes. Therefore, the overall goal of the proposed project is to test a visual remediation intervention for schizophrenia and determine its effects on specific visual targets with well-understood neurobiological mechanisms. The goal of the R61 is to determine the optimal intervention for improving the targets of contrast sensitivity (CS) and perceptual organization (PO). Extensive evidence exists for impaired CS and PO in schizophrenia. Moreover, these targets are prototypical examples of gain control and integration, respectively, which were identified by the NIMH-sponsored CNTRICS initiative as being the two core mechanisms involved in visual disturbances in the disorder. We will examine two computer-based interventions. One, ULTIMEYES (UE), targets CS. The other, contour integration training (CIT), targets PO. We will also examine the effects of combined treatment (UE&CIT). An active computer-based control treatment will be included. There will be 40 sessions, with assessments after every 10 sessions (N=20/group). The R61 Specific Aim is to evaluate the effects of UE and CIT on CS and PO targets, respectively, to determine if treatment effects meet a pre-specified effect-size criterion. Results of the R61 will be used to identify the treatment (UE, CIT, or UE&CIT) and duration (i.e., dose) that most effectively and efficiently improves the target(s). The goal of the R33 is to conduct an initial randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the optimal treatment identified in the R61. The R33 Specific Aims are to: 1) replicate and extend R61 results supporting visual target engagement in an adequately powered RCT (N=50/group); and 2) determine if visual target engagement is associated with improvements in cognition, social cognition, and functional capacity. If the R33 hypotheses are confirmed, results will inform the design of a later RCT to further explore mediators and moderators of treatment effects, and to move towards a precision medicine approach, wherein we determine which individuals are most likely to benefit from this intervention."

Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the extraordinary immunogenicity of modified mRNAs in mice translates to rhesus macaques in the setting of Zika and HIV immunizations. Thus, we anticipate that mRNA will be both cost-effective and highly immunogenic and therefore have the potential to be transformative to the HIV vaccine field as a vector."

For this reason, inhibitors of Vpu activity could be used to enhance immune killing of HIV infected cells in patients. This type of inhibitor could be an important component of therapies aimed at eliminating reservoirs of HIV infected cells.  The Johnson lab serendipitously discovered that Vpu targets the viral glycoprotein from Gibbon ape Leukemia Virus (GaLV Env) and prevents it from being incorporated into HIV-1 viral particles. Therefore, inhibiting Vpu activity greatly enhances infectivity when HIV-1 is used with this glycoprotein. GaLV Env was selected as a surrogate Vpu target in an assay for identifying inhibitors of Vpu activity. Unlike other types of Vpu assays, the output (infectivity) is quantitative in nature and very amenable to a high throughput screening.  Along with collaborators at Southern Research Institute (SRI, see letter of support), a large high throughput screening (HTS) campaign of over 650,000 compounds was initiated using this assay in hopes of finding appropriate Vpu inhibitors that could be advanced to clinical applications. This screen and dose response validation of the hits was completed in August 2017 and identified 205 candidate Vpu-inhibiting compounds.  The ultimate goal of this project is develop compounds that can be used to block Vpu activity in a clinical setting. The objective of this proposal is to determine which compounds from the HTS campaign are most suitable for further development as clinical Vpu inhibitors. 1. Conduct hit-to-lead studies to identify the best compound candidates.  a. Screen for compounds that do not block cellular SCF Ubiquitin machinery (off target).  b. Screen for compounds with Vpu-specific activity.  c. Screen with advanced toxicity and ADME assays to identify most desirable compounds. 2. Select for compounds with the desired biological activity.  a. Screen for compounds that block Vpu antagonism of CD4.  b. Screen for compounds that block Vpu antagonism of BST-2.  c. Screen for compounds that directly bind to Vpu."
"9522656","PROJECT SUMMARY There are inherent physical uncertainties with particle therapy (i.e. beam range uncertainty) which have become major factors leading to large margins, thereby unnecessarily exposing additional dose to normal tissues, and forcing clinicians taking overly conservative treatment plans to restrict the dose to tumor or avoiding advantageous beam angles to ensure sparing of critical organs at risk. It is critically important to overcome this impediment in order to dramatically enhance particle therapy outcomes and achieve its full clinical benefits. The goal of this research project is to develop an innovative PET image-based on-line verification of proton therapy for brain cancer treatment instead of the current off-line method in order to directly measure the potential deviation of actual proton beam range from that predicted by the treatment plan before the start of treatment. In this project, we challenge the conventional belief and propose a unique approach of using part of the therapy beams for imaging, thus overcoming the long-standing technical obstacle for achieving the on-line PET imaging method. We will pursue three specific aims to achieve the goal of this project: 1) Develop and evaluate a brain PET capable for desired on-line imaging; 2) Develop and evaluate algorithms and software that will select probing beams for range measurement and enable range-shift compensated beam delivery; 3) Establish and improve the on-line PET based range measurement and adaptive particle therapy. The success of this project will fill a critical technical gap and make the on-line PET based range measurement and adaptive particle therapy clinically practical for the first time. It could shift clinical study with a new image-based particle therapy paradigm, which will significantly improve the particle beam targeting, enable new and better treatment plan, and improve the therapy efficacy and patient care. The outcome of this project will also pave the way to develop similar technology for whole-body on-line PET imaging and adaptive particle therapy applications."
"9417949","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arsenic is an odorless and tasteless semi-metal that contaminates drinking water supplies from natural deposits in the earth. It is estimated that almost 3.7 million individuals in the US, and over 140 million individuals worldwide, are exposed regularly to drinking water that exceed government arsenic standards. Increasing attention has been recently paid to the declines in functional mobility resulting from chronic arsenic exposure, which we now understand to pose a significant risk for causing skeletal muscle myopathies and atrophy, impairments that are among the greatest factors contributing to declines in functional mobility and strong predictors of mortality. However, many questions of the health impacts of environmental exposures throughout life remain, including the underlying mechanisms by which exposures negatively impact the cellular microenvironment, stem cell phenotype and, ultimately, tissue maintenance and healing capacity.  There is a need to know whether and how environmental toxicants affect tissue maintenance and adult stem cell behavior and it is important to resolve how stem cell vulnerability to environmental contaminants affects the ability of otherwise healthy tissues to respond to acute injury. It is also critical to identify mechanisms of impairment in designing strategies and policies to prevent or reduce injury. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms for arsenic-stimulated alteration of transcriptional circuitries that disrupt intra- and inter-cellular communication within the niche and compromise muscle structural integrity.  We propose two specific aims to test our central hypothesis that arsenic stimulates fibroblast- mediated pathogenic matrix alterations, resulting in stem cell dysfunction and, ultimately, impaired wound repair after injury. In Specific Aim 1, we will test th hypothesis that exposure to commonly encountered levels of arsenic in drinking water promotes pathologic matrix remodeling to impair muscle stem cell function and regenerative capacity. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that arsenic dysregulates fibroblast activation, drivin an impaired muscle stem cell function and tissue repair response after injury. Success in these aims will both increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of arsenic-induced clinical symptoms of myasthenia, and will elucidate skeletal muscle micro environmental factors controlling stem cell declines. The long-term goal is to create prevention and/or intervention strategies to improve health outcomes of individuals living in arsenic-endemic areas."
"9478665","Project Summary/Abstract  The last decade has seen an explosion of interest in statistical modeling and analysis of spatiotemporally misaligned data and change-of-support problems, where different variables of scienti?c interest are observed at disparate scales making them dif?cult to be coherently modeled. This is especially relevant in environmental public health, where exposure data may be based upon data from monitoring data networks, while climate data are usually available as rasterized outputs from numerical models. The situation is further compounded by our objective of associating these factors with health outcomes (e.g. disease incidence, hospitalizations, mortality and so on), which are reported by public health sources as aggregated data over regions rather than at points. Furthermore, public health researchers today routinely encounter datasets exhibiting high-dimensional spatial misalignment or change-of-support, where ?dimension? refers to one or all of the following: (a) the number of spatial units (e.g., geographically referenced coordinates), (b) the number of temporal units (time points) at which the variables have been observed, and (c) the number of outcomes and other variables being studied. We propose a versatile collection of easily implementable and innovative Bayesian statistical methods that, in conjunction with appropriate software, will offer more comprehensive and statistically reliable mapping and analysis for misaligned spatiotemporal data in high-dimensional settings. Our methods and software will help spatial analysts to establish relationships among health outcomes and environmetal and climate-related predictors. Our dissemination efforts will deliver our methodology to a far broader audience of health and environmental researchers and administrators than is currently accessible."
"9616363","Project Summary Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies to nucleic acids and to proteins with which they associate. Signaling through the nucleic acid sensing TLR, TLR7 and TLR9, is critical in SLE pathogenesis, and dysregulated TLR signaling can promote lupus in humans and in mouse models. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and B cells both express these nucleic acid sensing TLR and are important in SLE pathogenesis. Autoreactive B cells produce pathogenic autoantibodies in SLE, and B cell antibody production is promoted by TLR7 and TLR9 signaling. pDC use TLR7 and TLR9 to respond to nucleic acids in immune complexes resulting in the secretion of large quantities of type I IFN cytokines, which have pleiotropic effects on the immune response, including enhancing dendritic cell (DC) maturation, plasma cell formation, and T cell responses, all of which can promote a feed forward loop of immune activation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which TLR7 and TLR9 signaling are regulated in these two critical cell types is important for understanding the pathogenesis of SLE and in defining therapeutic targets for this disease. We have made the novel discovery that the signaling adapter BCAP is highly expressed in pDC and is required for type I IFN production in response to TLR7 and TLR9 agonists from these cells. We also show for the first time that BCAP has a role in B cell TLR7 and TLR9 responses, and that loss of BCAP ameliorates disease development in a mouse model of lupus. Thus, BCAP is a key regulator of TLR7 and TLR9 function in pDC and B cells, and understanding how BCAP regulates TLR7/9 signaling in these cells will help identify new therapeutic targets in lupus and other IFN-associated autoimmune diseases. In aim 1, we will determine how BCAP regulates TLR7/9 responses in pDC and B cells, with a focus on mechanistic work and translation. In aim 2, we will determine the relative contribution of BCAP in pDC and B cells to the development of SLE using 2 mouse models, TLR7.1 mice and B6.Sle1.Yaa mice. Understanding the role of BCAP in pDC and B cell TLR7/9 responses will give us insights into lupus pathogenesis and allow us to evaluate BCAP as a therapeutic target in SLE."
"9639153","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most common HIV-associated cancer in sub-Saharan Africa. Even in the modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) era, survival after a diagnosis with KS in sub-Saharan Africa is poor, with a three year survival rate in some countries of only 30%. Timely treatment has been hampered in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) due to lack of resources that are needed for prompt and accurate KS diagnosis. In this project, we propose a new diagnostic approach that uses a smartphone confocal microscope to provide timely diagnosis of KS. The portable nature of the device means that it can be brought into the field, rather than requiring patients in rural areas t travel long distances for KS diagnosis. In our approach, KS- suspected skin lesions are imaged in vivo with a smartphone confocal microscope in a short procedural time (expected imaging time < 10 minutes). Confocal images can be immediately sent to an expert confocal image reader over the cellular network for image reading, or an automated image analysis application implemented in the smartphone can be used to render a diagnosis. As a result, the diagnosis is delivered to the patient in a timely manner and the treatment is initiated while the patient is stil at the local clinic. In Aim 1, we will develop a smartphone confocal microscope. We will use a reflectance confocal microscopy technique, slit spectrally encoded confocal microscopy (Slit-SECM), which can acquire two-dimensional images by using inexpensive light source and the imaging sensor in the smartphone. We will optimally design the smartphone confocal microscope, fabricate it, and test it for imaging performance. In Aim 2, we will evaluate clinical utility of the smartphone confocal microscope to diagnose KS in Uganda. Skin lesions suspected to be KS will be imaged with the smartphone confocal microscope, and confocal images will be compared with corresponding histologic images, which is the current gold standard. In a case control study, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity will be tested. While thi project focuses on diagnosing KS in LMICs, in future this same approach can be adapted for diagnosis of other diseases in both resource poor and resource rich settings. For example, during melanoma diagnosis and treatment, the smartphone confocal microscope could be adapted to image melanoma lesions non-invasively to guide biopsy and surgical treatment. In conjunction with an endoscopic imaging optics, the smartphone confocal microscope can be used for screening of early-stage cervical cancers. We strongly believe that the smartphone confocal microscopy will greatly improve the early diagnosis of a range of conditions, with the ultimate goal of helping to reduce health disparity around the globe."
"9546061","Project Abstract: Despite recent improvements in immunosuppression, graft/patient survival of small intestinal transplantation (ITx) remains suboptimal, limiting the broader application of this therapy. Induction of donor- specific tolerance to any organ is desirable to eliminate co-morbidities associated with immunosuppressive treatment. The induction of tolerance is particularly desirable for ITx due to: (1) the requirement for high levels of immunosuppression to prevent rejection of small bowel grafts; (2) complications associated with heavy immunosuppression; and (3) the young average age of the recipients. However, to our knowledge, tolerance of intestinal allografts has not been extensively studied in preclinical models. Even in rodent models, there are few reports demonstrating tolerance to small intestine, but one successful strategy has been through the induction of durable mixed allogeneic chimerism. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a large animal preclinical model for tolerance induction following ITx and to develop a protocol appropriate for tolerance induction in parent to child (living donor LD) ITx. We recently reported that rejection rates appear to be higher in clinical recipients of isolated intestinal transplants (iITx) compared to multivisceral transplants (MVTx), which include donor liver, stomach and pancreas. Notably we have found, for the first time, that T cell mixed chimerism which develops without GVHD following iITx and even more commonly following MVTx, is associated with reduced rejection rates. We hypothesize that the presence of graft-vs-host-reactive (GVHR) clones in these MVTx recipients facilitates engraftment of donor progenitor cells contained within the grafts, and further hypothesize that transplantation of additional hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during this period of the GVHR will augment chimerism and tolerance induction even in iITx recipients. The early GVHR that migrates from the graft to the recipient?s peripheral immune system (lymphohematopoietic GVH response, or LGVHR) makes hematopoietic ?space? for engraftment of these hematopoietic progenitors. In this proposal, we will utilize MHC inbred miniature swine, the only large animal model that allows reproducible transplantation with defined GVH and host-vs-graft (HvG) genetic barriers, to address the above hypotheses and develop a clinically relevant LD ITx tolerance induction model. We will first establish a porcine model of orthotopic iITx and MvTx that parallels our institution?s clinical protocol and determine the role of GVH and HvG alloreactivity in driving chimerism and clinical outcomes (Aim 1). We will then utilize the LGVHR and donor HSCs to achieve tolerance in long-term allograft acceptors in the models in Aim 1 (Aim 2). The studies in this proposal may have eventual clinical applicability that could solve the most problematic issues in ITx and vastly improve the outcomes of this therapeutic modality."
"9557134","Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a novel drug, R-4329, for the prevention and/or treatment of Clostridium (C.) difficile pathogenesis. R-4329 is based on a unique protein known as secreted antigen A (SagA) identified from Enterococcus faecium which our research team showed can protect against multiple enteric infections, including C. difficile, by enhancing the integrity of the gut membrane barrier1, 2. C. difficile is a ubiquitous anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium that can sporulate and become highly resistant to environment stresses and frontline antibiotics such as clindamycin3. Pathogenic strains of C. difficile secret toxins (A and B) that damage intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in inflammatory colitis, severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, flu-like symptoms, and possible death3. C. difficile infection (CDI) often occurs following antibiotic-treatment when the endogenous microflora of individuals is altered or severely reduced. Since 2000, the rate of CDI has increased from below 150,000 to over 250,000 cases and has been become one of the most significant hospital-acquired infections with an economic burden of over $1 billion to treat in the USA 3. Once C. difficile establishes residence in the colon, it is difficult to eradicate with last resort antibiotics (vancomycin) and consequently results in relapses of CDI and inflammatory colitis. An effective approach to treating CDI has been fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) therapy4. However, FMT is a heterogeneous and poorly defined therapeutic, for which its safety is still a major concern requiring special FDA approval4. New and well-defined therapeutics are desperately needed to prevent and treat CDI. Defined strains of probiotics offer an exciting alternative to prevent and treat CDI and many strains of Lactobacillus (acidophilus, casei, reuteri, plantarum) have been explored as probiotics to inhibit infection of enteric pathogens and mitigate antibiotic-associated diarrhea5. Unfortunately, the mechanism of action has been difficult to characterize with limiting beneficial effects in the context of their clinical utility6. While more clinical studies are still needed, these recent studies suggest that improved probiotics may be even more effective at controlling CDI. Indeed, our recent results published in the journal Science demonstrate that engineering or ?reprogramming? of probiotics to recombinantly express SagA yields a more protective functionality against enteric infections, including CDI2. Our goal is to develop a novel probiotic strain to deliver SagA (referred to as R-4329) as an orally administered drug that functions naturally to induce protective regulatory signals. The key objectives are to: 1) generate L. lactis clones expressing SagA from a genome- integrated operon; 2) select a R-4329 clinical candidate based on growth rate, SagA expression, and stability, and 3) demonstrate R-4329 activity in the murine C. difficile infection model. Successful commercialization of R-4329 will ultimately provide a profound front-line medical advancement in the treatment of enteric infection."
"9414611","TRAINING PROJECT SUMMARY  Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are  naturally occurring polydisperse linear polysaccharides that are heavily O- and N-sulfated. The interaction  between GAGs and proteins are critical for many biological processes including cell-cell and cell-matrix  interactions, cell migration and proliferation, growth factor sequestration, chemokine and cytokine activation,  microbial recognition and tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. Hundreds of HS-binding  proteins have been identified, but the oligosaccharide structures that mediate particular interactions have been  defined in only a few cases due to the structural complexity of HS. The objective of the Training component of  the Resource is to train scientist from outside the CCRC in cutting edge technologies developed by Resource  investigators and to ensure that these methods are transferred to the scientific community. The most effective  method to expose the outside investigators to our technologies is through hands-on training. Since 1990, the  CCRC and this resource have offered hands-on training courses to scientists from other institutions that wish  to learn analytical methods in complex carbohydrate science. Over the years, we have built a strong  infrastructure for training the next generation of glycobiologists in the most update methods of glycoconjugate  analysis. The aims of the Training component are: (1) Hands-on Training - we will offer four formal annual  hands-on training courses in (i.) Separation and Characterization of Glycoprotein and Glycolipid  Oligosaccharides, (ii.) Techniques for Characterization of Carbohydrate Structure of Polysaccharide, (iii.)  Analytical Techniques for Structural Characterization of Proteoglycans, (iv.) Mass Spectrometry of  Glycoproteins. The third course (Analytical Techniques for Structural Characterization of Proteoglycans)  is particularly dedicated to technologies that are developed in this resource. However, all other hands-on  courses have components of methods tools being developed incorporated in them such as the NMR,  molecular modeling, MS modules. (2) Incorporation of New Technologies - Part of the success of the  hands-on training has been due to implementing the new technologies derived from the TR&Ds into the  laboratory experiments and protocols. We continually strive to improve our workshops by adding newly  developed techniques and methods. Plans are underway to expand Course III with an online LC-ESI-MS  experiment using the new LTQ-Fusion with its various fragmentation capabilities and use the new Capillary  Electrophoresis in the service laboratory to design an experiment for separation of negatively charged GAG  oligomers by CE for this training course."
"9412404","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the previous funding period, we made significant advances in the discovery and characterization of the lipid rafts of Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease. Cholesterol glycolipids form lipid rafts in both in vitro and host-derived spirochetes and that these domains have all the hallmarks of eukaryotic lipid rafts. We further demonstrated that the lipid rafts of B. burgdorferi shift their morphology at different temperatures and have a selective presence of lipoproteins, proteases and their substrates, sensing molecules, and homologs of eukaryotic lipid raft markers. Lipid rafts are dynamic structures with shifting protein cargo that define their biological functions. Fo this renewal application, we will expand our investigations into the dynamic features of the lipid rafts and into their function. The overall hypothesis is that the protein content as well the proten concentrations of lipid rafts change in response to the different conditions that the Borrelia moves through in its vector (tick) - host (mammal) stages, and that these changes influence the adaptation mechanisms required by the organisms to complete their life-cycle. To test this hypothesis, this renewal application will address the following Specific Aims: 1. To characterize the proteomes of the lipid rafts of Borrelia under different biological conditions, and 2. To probe the mechanisms of dynamic change and life-cycle adaptation by studying the contributions of unique elements of the proteome. A number of novel biophysical, imaging and biochemical approaches will provide the results to demonstrate that the Borrelia lipid rafts have important biological functions. Cholesterol as a component of bacterial membranes is being reported in an enlarging number of bacterial pathogens thereby increasing the significance of this proposal, as it is clear that cholesterol utilization is not an isolated feature of the Borreliae."
"9285260","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In response to PAR-14-338: Secondary Analyses of Existing Alcohol Epidemiology Data, this project Sexual Orientation, Discrimination, and Health Disparities in DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorders proposes to use existing alcohol epidemiological data to examine relationships among sexual orientation, childhood adversity, sexual orientation discrimination (individual-level and institutional-level), recent stressful events and DSM-5 alcohol use disorders (AUDs). AUDs are among the most prevalent mental health disorders and contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over 65 million adults in the U.S. will meet criteria for a DSM-5 AUD, with past research finding that sexual minorities are at disproportionately high risk for AUD. To date, no large-scale nationally representative studies have examined sexual-orientation-related health disparities in DSM-5 AUD and there is limited data on DSM-5 AUD severity, comorbidity, and disability among sexual minorities. A significant gap in knowledge remains regarding the underlying reasons why sexual minorities are more likely to meet criteria for DSM-5 AUD. Thus, we propose to build on our prior work by conducting secondary analyses using the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III), a nationally representative sample of 36,309 U.S. adults. The NESARC-III is the only nationally representative study that has sufficient measures and sample size to test for potential age, gender, racial/ethnic and sexual orientation differences and to meet the objectives of our study, which aims to: (1) estimate the prevalence of (a) DSM-5 AUD diagnoses including severity (mild, moderate and severe), (b) identify potential differences in AUD diagnoses between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria, and (c) examine DSM-5 psychiatric comorbidity associated with DSM-5 AUD based on sexual orientation (attraction, behavior, and identity); (2) assess the disability (social functioning), help seeking (e.g., self-help), and recovery (e.g., abstinence) associated with DSM-5 AUD based on sexual orientation; and (3) examine risk factors (e.g., individual- and institutional-level sexual orientation discrimination, and stressful life events). Analyses will focus on multiple developmental domains (i.e., childhood, adolescence, adulthood, past-year) and potential moderators (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, and childhood adversity) associated with DSM-5 AUD severity, psychiatric comorbidity, and disability among sexual minorities. The proposed project will benefit from the unique opportunities afforded by the 2012-2013 NESARC such as: the largest nationally representative sample of sexual minority women and men currently available; the assessment of all three major dimensions of sexual orientation (attraction, behavior and identity); and the wealth of data on DSM-5 AUD and other psychiatric disorders. We will also examine the impact of changes from the DSM-IV to DSM-5 for AUDs among sexual minorities. The project uses a theory-driven approach in assessing how childhood adversity, sexual orientation discrimination, and recent stressors contribute to alcohol-related health disparities based on sexual orientation."
"9418110","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death in the developed world, accounting for near 30% of all deaths globally and 35% in the US annually. Coronary artery disease (CAD) with its associated thrombotic risk is responsible for 1 of 6 deaths in the US. Coincidentally, implantable blood recirculating devices, which have provided lifesaving solutions to patients with severe cardiovascular diseases, are burdened with thrombosis and thromboembolic complications, mandating complex life-long anticoagulation. The mechanisms underlying vascular disease processes and device-related thrombotic complications are intertwined. Thrombosis in vascular disease is potentiated by the interaction of blood constituents with an injured vascular wall and the non-physiologic flow patterns generated in cardiovascular pathologies initiate and enhance the hemostatic response by chronically activating the platelets. Similarly, device thrombogenicity is induced by pathological flow fields and contact with foreign surfaces. Upon activation platelets undergo complex biochemical and morphological changes. The coupling of the disparate spatio-temporal scales between molecular level events and the macroscopic transport represents a major modeling and computational challenge, which requires a multidisciplinary integrated multiscale numerical approach. Continuum approaches are limited in their ability to cover the smaller molecular mechanisms such as filopodia formation during platelet activation. Utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) to cover the multiscales involved is computationally prohibitive. In this application we offer to develop a comprehensive state-of-the-art multiscale numerical methodology that will be able to bridge the gap between the macroscopic transport and the ensuing molecular events. We will use an integrated Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) and Coarse Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD) approach that allows platelets to continuously change their shape and synergistically activate by a biomechanical transductive linkage chain, interact with other blood constituents and clotting factors, aggregate, and interact and adhere to the blood vessels and devices. In this multiscale model, a mechanotransduction CGMD bottom platelet activation model is embedded into a DPD blood flow top model. The dynamic stresses of the macroscale model will be interactively translated to the micro to nanoscale model of the intra-platelet associated intracellular events. The model predictions will be validated in vitro in a carefully designed set of experiments. This will be achieved according to the following specific aims: We will develop a mechanotransduction model of platelet mediated thrombosis where a top/macro-scale model of flow-induced thrombogenicity using DPD at the µm-length and ms-time scales, in which multiple flowing platelets interact with each other and blood vessel walls or devices, will be fully coupled with a bottom/micro-scale model using CGMD at the nm-length and ps-time scales, in which platelets with multiple intracellular constituents evolve during activation as platelet lose their quiescent discoid shape and filopodia grow. The top and bottom models will be interfaced such that the hemodynamics will interactively respond to platelet shape change upon activation and platelet aggregation and thrombus is formed. The effect of modulating platelet mechanical properties via antiplatelet agents will be modeled as well. All model aspects will be validated in vitro in a series of carefully designed experiments characterizing the mechanical properties of platelets and using blood flow experiments where conditions leading to flow induced platelet activation will be replicated, as well as experiments where platelet-wall and platelet device interactions will be measured and where platelets will be pretreated with modulating agents. These data will be used to fine tune the large number of model parameters involved in this multiscale simulation and for validating the model predictions. An independent 3rd party evaluation of the model credibility is also included as an integral part of the project. e will also concentrate on the development of efficient algorithms adapted for ultra-scalable large HPC clusters to reduce prohibitive computation costs, so as to bring such ambitious large multiscale simulations within the reach of the multiscale modeling community at large and enable to adopt it to other relevant modeling needs and interests. To further enable these technologies, large sharable data base will be created where software tools, numerical codes, model and experimental data and protocols will be deposited and guidance will be provided for using them. The leaders of the project will be active in various MSM consortium working groups to further disseminate the project outcomes and share them with the modeling community. The methodology proposed represents a paradigm shift in the burgeoning field of multiscale simulations and its application to solving complex clinical problems at the interface of engineering and biology. Predicting the progression of arterial thrombosis under circulation conditions, providing tools for improved pharmacological management as compared to existing empirics-based treatments, and providing a modeling tool for developing the next generation of devices with reduced thrombogenicity may lead to reduced mortality rates, improved patients' quality of life, and an overall reduction of the financial burden of the ensuing healthcare costs."
"9537747","Paclitaxel is a cytoskeletal drug commonly used for the treatment of breast, lung, and ovarian cancer. Peripheral neuropathic pain (CIPN) is one of the most common and serious adverse effects experienced by cancer patients treated with paclitaxel. CIPN can be a dose-limiting factor for chemotherapy, leading to premature termination of treatment, thereby influencing survival and quality of life. Currently, no therapies have been identified that address the underlying pathogenic mechanisms such as neurodegeneration; in fact, the current symptomatic therapies are frequently ineffective in mitigating the painful symptoms of CIPN in the majority of patients. Therefore, the identification of alternative forms of therapy is a crucial medical need. The primary objective of this proposal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to paclitaxel- induced neuropathy in mice. We observed pronounced paclitaxel-induced CIPN in C57BL/6NJ strain but not in the closely related C57BL/6J substrain. Because the parental substrains are nearly genetically identical, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in an experimental F2 cross (Reduced Complexity Cross; RCC) will greatly facilitate the identification of novel genetic factors that underlie differences in CIPN behaviors. In Aim 1, we will use the RCC to map genomic regions, or QTLs, that are causally associated with susceptibility versus resilience to multiple measures of CIPN. In Aim 2, we will conduct transcriptome analysis via mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of spinal and peripheral neuronal regions in control mice and paclitaxel-treated mice from the parental male and female C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ substrains. The transcriptome in control mice will aid in identifying differentially expressed, candidate CIPN susceptibility genes underlying the QTLs . Genes that are differentially expressed as a consequence of paclitaxel will reveal changes in the transcriptome relevant to central and peripheral neuronal plasticity and the behaviors/changes that support the long-term establishment of CIPN that may be important for treatment reversal. In Aim 3, we will validate candidate quantitative trait genes and functional variants that influence susceptibility to and establishment of CIPN. These studies will provide rapid genetic and neurobiological insight into CIPN. Future studies will test for translational potential in human genetics, human experimental model systems (e.g., hIPSCs), and new potential therapeutics to combat the debilitating side effects of CIPN in cancer patients."
"9434083","PROJECT DESCRIPTION / SUMMARY Much of our collective knowledge on vascular growth has emerged from efforts to understand angiogenesis, a process by which endothelial cells depart from pre-existent vessels to form new vascular beds. Nonetheless, once formed, vascular tubes also expand in width, length, and are able to regenerate. Regeneration is extremely important to the repair of endothelial damage imposed by stents and other medical devises, as well as to mediate heal after physical/chemical trauma. However our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate endothelial growth and regeneration within the context of a fully functional, blood perfused and pulsatile vessel are limited. Our preliminary data show that expansion of the tunica intima in vivo occurs through intrinsic proliferation of intimal endothelial cells in a polarized and organized manner. In fact, a subset of endothelial cells flanking a wound are robustly induced to enter into the cell cycle as quickly as 12 hours following injury in a highly synchronized fashion. The process is initiated by changes in cell-cell junctions that trigger molecular rewiring and impressive physiological changes. Important outcomes of these responses include alterations in endothelial cell polarity, induction of chromatin remodeling, adjustments in metabolism and a quick emergence of a transcriptional signature that is unique to regenerative endothelium. This newly identified signature is finely tuned by the timed release of stress signals that appear to act differentially in the subsets of endothelial cells, revealing an intrinsic heterogeneity that controls the threshold for regeneration in a given vessel. In fact, genetic tracing analysis using endothelial-specific rainbow mice revealed the presence of cells with different proliferative potential suggesting the intercalation of progenitors within the wall of the endothelial monolayer. Taken together, these studies are paradigm shifting for understanding the mechanisms controlling endothelial regeneration and their deregulations in settings like chronic/acute inflammation, aging, chronic diseases and physical trauma. Through this NHLBI Outstanding Investigator Award application our goals are to (1) decode the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the process of endothelial expansion within a formed vessel; (2) clarify the process involved in endothelial regeneration and repair: (3) understand how hijacking these mechanisms might either accelerate or impair endothelial regeneration; (4) identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at endothelial repair during stenting or other injuries. These series of broadly defined aims have been conceptualize to fill gaps of our knowledge on fundamental biological processes in endothelial cell biology but also to exploit this information for application during medical interventions such as stent coverage. We are energized by the opportunity afforded by this grant mechanism and for the potential translational impact of these studies."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop Cardio Thoracic Events and Decompensated heart failure (INVESTED) I s a multi-center, randomized, double blind, active-control trial of high dose influenza vaccine compared to standard dose influenza vaccine for three seasons in adult participants with a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure. The primary outcome measure is the composite of death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, and secondary outcomes include composite of cardiopulmonary death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization, all-cause death or all-cause hospitalization, all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, cardiopulmonary death, and all cause death. Background: The substantial number of individuals in North America with myocardial infarction or heart failure (HF) are at high risk for influenza infection and associated morbidity, mortality and increased health care costs despite annual influenza vaccination. Higher dose of vaccine is approved for use in older adults but not in patients with heart failure. Antibody-mediated immunity contributes to vaccine-induced protection from influenza illness. Preliminary data: Our research group has shown in a meta-analysis that influenza vaccine reduces the risk for cardiovascular events and has also demonstrated reduced antibody titers to influenza vaccination in patients with HF. Additionally, we've shown in a pilot study that double dose influenza vaccine resulted in increased titers and was well tolerated. Methods: A multi-center, randomized, double blinded randomized trial will be conducted with 4650 patients assigned to the standard dose vaccine dose and 4650 patients to high dose influenza vaccine. The primary outcome measure is the composite of death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization, assessed at the end of each influenza season. Secondary outcomes will include the composite of death or cardiovascular hospitalizations, death or all-cause hospitalizations, and mortality. The study will also examine associations between geometric mean antibody titers and risk for death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations. Significance: A positive trial may be able to provide crucial information to infom health care policy regarding optimal influenza vaccination dosing among individuals with high risk cardiovascular disease."
"9561787","ABSTRACT There are no effective therapies to treat Cryptosporidium, an important opportunistic pathogen of AIDS patients that is now recognized as significant cause of diarrheal disease worldwide. Individuals who are immunocompromised are highly susceptible to cryptosporidiosis and experience chronic, debilitating and sometimes fatal diarrhea unless the immune system can be reconstituted. Development of effective therapeutics for cryptosporidiosis is undoubtedly a medical imperative. Many therapeutics in clinical use today are, or are derived from, natural products and a large untapped source of naturally occurring bioactive compounds is the ocean. We propose to search for novel anti-cryptosporidial compounds with therapeutic potential in a unique chemical library of marine compounds. The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute (HBOI) natural products library consists of 125 purified compounds and 6500 highly enriched fractions from extracts of marine organisms collected from a wide range of habitats including deep sea enviroments; the diversity and novelty of the compounds contained in this library has been well documented and includes compounds effective against the related apicomplexan pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. To illustrate the potential success of this approach, in screening just a few strains of marine symbiotic bacteria for bioactive compounds we discovered the compound Tartrolon D that is broadly effective at nM levels against multiple apicomplexan parasites including Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium. Therefore we hypotheisze that screening the HBOI library against Cryptosporidium will identify multiple novel compounds with potent activity against this parasite. We will test this hypothesis through completion of the following aims: Aim 1: Screen the HBOI Peak library against Cryptosporidium parvum-infected cells using a high throughput assay for cell viability. The library will be tested against Cryptosporidium-infected intestinal epithelial cells and anti-parasitic activity detected by an increase in host-cell viability. Aim 2: Prioritization of anti-Cryptosporidium active fractions and purified compounds. Positive hits will be verified by examining activity against luciferase-expressing Cryptosporidium in standard cell culture and in intestinal and lung organoids. Positive hits will also be tested against Toxoplasma gondii. Aim 3. Isolation and structure elucidation of active compounds: Positive fractions with the greatest potential for discovery of novel inhibitors will be taken through further purification and the structures of the active compounds defined using spectroscopic methods. Currently there are only a handful of anti-cryptosporidial compounds in various stages of development. Expanding drug discovery, especially into the realm of natural products, is critical to the ultimate goal of bringing an effective anti-Cryptosporidium therapeutic to the clinics."
"9417081","Short-term memory, the ability to hold information in mind over short timescales, is a fundamental cognitive process underlying an array of complex abilities. In contrast to long-term memory, which involves modification of synaptic connections, short-term memory is associated with sustained neural activity in cortical and subcortical structures. In particular, recent studies have suggested that the posterior parietal cortex plays a key role in maintaining mnemonic traces. However, it is not understood how the neural activity in these regions supports the maintenance of short-term memory. The goal of this project is to develop a short-term memory task for head-fixed mice and to leverage recent advances in 2-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics to dissect the neural circuits underlying short-term memory. This goal will be undertaken with the following aims: (Aim 1) Develop a short-term memory task for mice, and measure the neural signature of short-term memory in visual and parietal cortices using 2-photon calcium imaging. (Aim 2) Determine the necessity and time course of sustained activity in specific cortical regions using targeted optogenetic inactivation. (Aim 3a) Investigate the role of norepinephrine on sustained cortical activity during the short-term memory task by optogenetic modulation of noradrenergic tone. (Aim 3b) Determine whether the duration and accuracy of short-term memory maintenance can be improved by optogenetic modulation of norepinephine release. Developing a systems-level understanding of short-term memory will yield critical insights into how the brain represents and maintains information, and may have translational implications for treating deficits in short-term memory commonly observed in normal aging and psychiatric disorders."
"9415995","Neurodegenerative diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly Veterans. No cures exist for neurodegenerative diseases, because the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms that cause neurons to die with age are poorly understood. Our long-term objective is to decipher the mechanisms required for neuronal function and survival and to identify how dysfunction of these mechanisms contribute to progressive age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Comprehensive genome wide studies of patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy recently identified the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2? kinase 3/PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (EIF2AK3/PERK) gene as a genetic risk factor for neurodegeneration. EIF2AK3/PERK encodes an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein kinase that is essential for cells to survive pathologic and environmental conditions that cause misfolded proteins and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In response to misfolded proteins and ER stress, EIF2AK3/PERK dimerizes to activate its kinase domain. Multiple EIF2AK3/PERK haplotypes with various amino acid substitutions are found in the human population. The function of EIF2AK3/PERK in neurons and the mechanism by which some EIF2AK3/PERK haplotypes cause neurodegeneration are unknown. We recently discovered that EIF2AK3/PERK haplotypes associated with neurodegeneration have significantly reduced kinase activity compared to protective haplotypes. We also found that neurons generated from skin fibroblasts of patients with high-risk EIF2AK3/PERK haplotypes showed impaired EIF2AK3/PERK signaling in response to ER stress. Last, we found that EIF2AK3/PERK signaling is robustly activated in a mouse model of tauopathy neurodegeneration. Based on these preliminary findings, our central hypothesis is that EIF2AK3/PERK is activated during neurodegeneration to preserve neuronal cell function and viability, and loss of EIF2AK3/PERK function leads to increased protein misfolding and increased ER stress that ultimately cause neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration. We propose cellular, molecular, and genetic experiments to test this hypothesis and determine the function of EIF2AK3/PERK in neurodegeneration. First, we will characterize the biochemical and enzymatic activities of high-risk and low-risk human EIF2AK3/PERK associated with neurodegeneration. We will perform biochemical studies of recombinant EIF2AK3/PERK proteins to analyze the functional consequences of amino acid alterations associated with human haplotype variants. Second, we will test if modulation of EIF2AK3/PERK signaling prevents disease in the PS19 transgenic mouse model of neurodegeneration. We will cross PS19 mice with genetically modified mice that increase EIF2AK3/PERK signaling. We will treat PS19 mice with orally available drugs that increase or inhibit EIF2AK3/PERK signaling. We will perform molecular, histologic, and behavioral studies to examine how EIF2AK3/PERK modulation affects neuropathology and neurodegeneration in this animal model. Last, we will evaluate EIF2AK3/PERK signal transduction in stem cell-derived neurons generated from patients with high-risk and low-risk EIF2AK3/PERK haplotypes. We will determine how genetic variants of EIF2AK3/PERK affect neuronal tau protein folding and neuronal susceptibility to ER stress-induced cell death. In parallel, we will test novel pharmacologic modulators of EIF2AK3/PERK signaling to see if we can prevent neuronal cell death when PERK is artificially activated. In summary, EIF2AK3/PERK variants are important genetic risk factors for developing neurodegeneration but their function and mechanisms are unknown and treatments are lacking. These studies are significant because they will reveal the role of EIF2AK3/PERK in neurons and why EIF2AK3/PERK variants in people can increase risk for developing neurodegeneration. Our studies will positively benefit the mission of the VA by identifying potential treatments to prevent neurodegeneration in Veterans and patients carrying the high-risk alleles."
"9406336","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to NHLBI TOSI HL-131: Exposure of the developing lung to cigarette smoke is an independent risk factor for the development of chronic lung disease (CLD), including asthma in later life. Even more importantly, recently, it has been shown that by altering specific developmental signaling pathways necessary for fetal lung development, the perinatal nicotine exposure-related CLD risk is not restricted only to the nicotine exposed offspring, but is also transmitted transgenerationally to the progeny of the subsequent non-exposed offspring (Rehan et al, AJP Lung; 2013;305:L501-7). Specifically, nicotine alters the normal differentiation of mesenchymal cells in the developing lung by stimulating the Wnt pathway, inhibiting PPAR? signaling, resulting in the myogenic phenotype of the airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. Interestingly, these effects are sex-specific, with the molecular and functional effects on ASM cells seen exclusively in males. Importantly, PPAR? agonists, which are potent Wnt antagonists, can inhibit and/or reverse these effects. Hypothesizing that these effects are determined by nicotine-induced epigenetic changes in the gonadal germ line, which lead to lung specific molecular and functional effects, we propose to examine the mechanistic basis for the 1) transgenerational (TG) transmission, and 2) gender-specificity of perinatal nicotine exposure-induced offspring lung hyperresponsive phenotype. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the perinatal nicotine exposure-induced lung phenotype is transmitted via the male vs. female germline (Aim 1A), whether it is affected by the genetic diversity of parents (Aim 1B), and whether the lung phenotype seen in childhood is also seen in adulthood (Aim 1C). In Aim 2, we will determine whether the more pronounced perinatal nicotine exposure-induced pulmonary phenotype seen in males is determined by the differential PKC expression and activation in ASM cells of males vs. females (Aim 2A) and whether this is abrogated by blocking the specific PKC isoform involved (Aim 2B). In Aim 3, we will determine whether perinatal nicotine exposure-induced germ line and ASM epigenetic changes are transmitted from F1 to F3 generation (Aim 3A) and whether concomitant suppression of nicotine-induced Wnt activation, using PPAR? agonist rosiglitazone, blocks these epigenetic changes and protects against perinatal nicotine-induced TG transmission of the lung myogenic phenotype (Aim 3B). The concepts put forward in this proposal are totally novel and innovative, thus advancing the field significantly by addressing the fundamental mechanism(s) that explain the detrimental effects of maternal smoking not only on the exposed offspring, but also on the many generations that follow. Using this comprehensive cell-molecular-epigenetic approach, the proposed studies are likely to not only generate new, pivotal molecular data that could significantly impact our understanding of the pathogenesis of CLD, but also provide novel mechanistic information underlying CLD risk, paving the way for studying molecular mechanisms underlying TG effects on a host of other environmental exposures."
"9510816","Project Summary Influenza A virus (IAV) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes seasonal epidemics annually and has the potential to cause worldwide pandemics. Life-threatening pneumonia occurs in only a small minority of infected individuals (0.04-0.4% of cases). Pre-existing pulmonary disease and acquired immunodeficiencies are well- known risk factors. The vast majority of severe influenza cases, however, remain unexplained, especially in children. Intriguingly, classical primary immunodeficiencies do not predispose to severe influenza. We recently reported an otherwise healthy child with severe influenza due to inherited autosomal recessive (AR) IRF7 deficiency resulting in impaired interferon (IFN)-?/? production in both plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived pulmonary epithelial cells (PECs). This was the first demonstration that influenza susceptibility could be heritable. We hypothesize that additional cases of severe influenza in children and young adults may result from single-gene inborn errors of immunity, not necessarily displaying complete penetrance. We recently performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a cohort of 25 patients and their parents (trio design) with life-threatening influenza without secondary bacterial pneumonia. We discovered a homozygous IRF9 mutation in a child with life-threatening influenza and a history of adverse reaction to MMR vaccination. IRF9, with STAT1 and STAT2, is one of the three subunits of ISGF3, the main transcriptional complex that drives antiviral type I IFN responses. The mutation is private to this kindred and affects an essential nucleotide at a splice site. We intend to test whether the mutation is deleterious, in terms of expression and function. We will also test the patient's cells for response to type I IFN and their control of influenza virus in the presence of type I IFNs. Finally, we will compare the genome-wide transcriptome responses to type I IFNs in the patient's cells with those from other patients with autosomal recessive, complete defects in IFNAR1, IFNAR2, STAT1, and STAT2. Our preliminary data are convincing and strong, as we showed that the splice mutation is not leaky and the encoded protein is loss of ISGF3 expression and function. Moreover, the patient's cells seem to control influenza virus poorly even in the presence of exogenous type I IFNs. Finally, we have collected cells from patients with all types of inborn errors of the type I IFN responsive pathway. Our project is thus highly innovative, yet supported by strong preliminary evidence. Collectively, our project will characterize, in depth, the molecular and cellular basis of a new primary immunodeficiency, autosomal recessive IRF9 deficiency, thereby documenting a second genetic and immunological etiology of severe influenza of childhood. This study will give weight to the emerging notion that severe influenza of childhood can be caused by single-gene inborn errors of immunity. Our study will also have new and important biological implications, providing the first analysis of IRF9-dependent and -independent responses to type I IFNs in humans. Overall, our discovery will have both biological and clinical implications."
"9604457","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastomas (GBM) exhibit a remarkable tumor cell heterogeneity, which contributes to the overall regenerative and aggressive disease traits. Recent studies in our laboratory's and others' strongly support the existence of a cellular hierarchy within GBM in which brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) at the apex are the driving force of disease recurrence and resistance to current therapies. It is imperative to consider the intimate and dynamic interactions between BTICs and their immediate environments in perivascular, hypoxic, and necrotic regions within the tumor. These locations serve as functional niches for BTICs and facilitate access to various factors and interacting partners that promote their growth- and ultimately of the overall tumor. While clinical studies have uncovered high platelet counts as a negative prognostic marker for survival outcomes in GBM patients, there is no study to functionally elucidate a role for platelets in this highly aggressive disease. The proposed studies aim to uncover a biological role for platelets in driving the growth and stemness qualities specifically of BTICs, which have been histologically detected in BTIC-related niches in primary clinical specimens. As location serves a strong purpose within the context of BTICs, successful characterization of potential crosstalk between platelets and BTICs will offer a new clinical perspective into GBM and inform of a novel treatment paradigm to target these specific cell-to-cell interactions. The development of effective therapeutics to disrupt platelets-BTIC interactions may improve the long-term clinical outcomes of GBM patients undergoing current standard therapies."
"9539304","PROJECT SUMMARY Acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial pathogen that causes a range of diseases, including respiratory and urinary tract infections, meningitis, endocarditis, wound infections, and bacteremia. In fact, A. baumannii is now responsible for up to 20% of all intensive care unit infections in some regions of the world with pneumonia being the most common presentation. The clinical significance of A. baumannii has been propelled by this organism's rapid acquisition of resistance to virtually all antibiotics. The identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention is critical to our ability to protect the public health from this emerging infectious threat. One promising potential area of therapeutic development involves targeting bacterial access to nutrient metal or metal handling. This strategy is based on the fact that all bacterial pathogens require nutrient metal in order to colonize their hosts, and alterations in dietary metal levels profoundly affect susceptibility to infection. The host protein calprotectin (CP) is one of the most important contributors to immune-mediated metal restriction and CP protects against infection through the chelation of nutrient zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn). In this application, we describe our use of CP as a probe to uncover a genetic locus within A. baumannii that is involved in survival during conditions of CP-dependent Zn starvation. This locus encodes a member of the conserved COG0523 family of GTPases that we have named Zur-induced GTPase A (ZigA), and a D-alanine D-alanine carboxypeptidase that we have named Zn-regulated lipoprotein A (ZrlA). We have discovered that ZigA is a metallochaperone that provides Zn to client proteins and is required for the liberation of a biovavailable Zn pool during conditions of Zn starvation. This finding establishes ZigA as the first example of a Zn metallochaperone in nature. In addition, our model predicts that ZrlA is required to maintain cell wall architecture during Zn stress. Based on these fundamental discoveries, we hypothesize that upon Zn starvation, A. baumannii mobilizes Zn to critical Zn-requiring client proteins, while also activating the expression of a carboxypeptidase involved in peptidoglycan remodeling that substitutes for the loss of activity of a Zn-requiring paralog. To test this central hypothesis, we propose a series of experiments aimed at understanding the mechanism and pathophysiological consequence of the A. baumannii response to dietary and host-imposed Zn deprivation during the pathogenesis of pneumonia. In these studies, we will (i) define the target of the ZigA Zn-metallochaperone during conditions of CP- imposed Zn restriction, (ii) elucidate the contribution of ZrlA to peptidoglycan remodeling during conditions of Zn deprivation, and (iii) determine the importance of Zn distribution during the pathogenesis of A. baumannii pneumonia. These results will provide fundamental insight into how A. baumannii responds to nutrient deprivation in the vertebrate host, and lay the foundation for the creation of peptide therapeutics based on a CP scaffold that inhibit microbial growth through nutrient metal chelation."
"9417070","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lymphatic vessels serve an essential function in maintaining interstitial fluid balance throughout the body. They also serve as a conduit for the trafficking and maturation of immune cells. Functional disruption of lymphatic vessels by either surgery, radiation/chemotherapy or organ damage results in pathological lymphedema and subsequent interstitial fibrous deposition and inflammation. The heart contains a dense network of lymphatic vessels that exhibit coordinated flow with each contraction of the myocardium. However, whether lymphatic dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiological progression of heart injury following myocardial ischemia remains unknown. Furthermore, we lack a full understanding of the consequences of myocardial edema on heart function following ischemic heart disease. Therefore the overall goal of this research proposal is to develop sophisticated surgical and genetic mouse model tools to address the function and modulation of cardiac lymphatic vessels in heart disease. Based on our expertise in lymphatic vessel biology and our interest in the cardioprotective functions of adrenomedullin peptide, we feel that we are uniquely well- positioned to address the effects of either increased cardiac lymphatics or lymphatic insufficiency on the resolution or exacerbation of myocardial edema, respectively. Results from our studies will provide conceptually novel insights into the largely unexplored role of cardiac lymphatic vessels in myocardial edema."

"9464141","Abstract: Cancer Immunotherapy Through Intratumoral Activation of Recall Responses The overarching goal for this project is to elucidate whether recall antigen expression in the tumor microenvironment can be used to enhance cancer immunotherapy, or potentially, serve as a new anti-cancer modality. These studies will also determine whether immunological memory/pre- existing immunity against an oncolytic poliovirus, PVSRIPO, is an impediment or asset to therapy. PVSRIPO is showing remarkable promise in patients with glioblastoma, recently received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA, and represents a unique approach delivering a potent human recall antigen (polio capsid) into human tumors. Surmounting evidence indicates that recall response activation leads to both innate and adaptive inflammation, capable of inducing immune responses against new antigens. This proposal seeks to harness the power of these responses to enhance cancer immunotherapy. This will be accomplished through testing the role of pre-existing anti-polio immunity on PVSRIPO therapy in mouse models of melanoma and brain cancer in affecting both efficacy and antitumor immunity. Additionally, polio and tetanus antigens, which are recall antigens for nearly everyone in the world, will be exogenously delivered into murine melanoma and brain tumors to test if intratumoral inflammation and engagement of antitumor immunity occurs in mice with recall responses to these antigens. Lastly, an in vitro human system will be used to evaluate the effects of recall antigen induced inflammation on antigen presenting cells and priming of new T cells. These studies aim to exhaustively test the adjuvant potential of recall responses in the context of cancer immunotherapy; which has remained an unexplored route to engage antitumor immunity to date."
"9431245","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of the project is to understand the causes of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD). In HD polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin (Httexp) causes early synaptic dysfunction and eventual neurodegeneration through poorly understood mechanisms. We previously discovered that Httexp binds to and sensitizes inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 (InsP3R1) to InsP3. We also demonstrated that a novel inhibitor of neuronal store-operated calcium entry (nSOC) improved motor symptoms in transgenic HD flies and inhibited and neurodegeneration in YAC128 HD mouse medium spiny neurons (MSNs), the primary cell type affected in HD. Based on these results, we propose that excessive activation of InsP3R1 causes a persistent reduction in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium levels, elevated nSOC and neuronal and dendritic spine loss in HD-afflicted MSNs. To test this hypothesis, we will focus on the following aims: 1. To evaluate the causes and importance of supranormal nSOC in synaptic loss in HD MSNs To test the role of InsP3R1, we will use antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to knockdown InsP3R1 expression in YAC128 MSNs. We will also reduce levels of InsP3 by overexpressing a 5PP-RA phosphatase that metabolizes InsP3. To test the role of nSOC more directly we will use genetic strategies to knockout or knockdown STIM2, a regulator of synaptic nSOC. The effects of suppression of InsP3R1- and STIM2- mediated signaling will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo in experiments with the YAC128 HD mouse model. 2. To investigate the role of sigma 1 receptor (S1R) in HD and to evaluate S1R as a potential therapeutic target. Sigma 1 receptor (S1R) is an ER-resident protein that is activated in response to ER stress and ER calcium depletion. Activated S1R is thought to promote neuroprotection and stabilize InsP3R function, which may protect MSNs and their synaptic connections. Our preliminary data indicates upregulation of S1R in the striatum of both aged YAC128 mice and human HD patients. We will study changes in S1R- mediated signaling in the HD-afflicted striatum and investigate the potential relationship between S1R and ER Ca2+ signaling in HD MSN spines. We will also use a variety of pharmacological and molecular tools to validate S1R as a novel therapeutic target for HD. In these studies we will evaluate potential roles of dysregulated ER Ca2+ signaling, nSOC and S1R in synaptic loss in HD MSNs. We will also appraise InsP3R1, STIM2 and S1R as potential therapeutic targets for HD."
"9322286","Persisting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) evade rapid killing by chemotherapeutic agents and are the reservoir for treatment failure and relapse of tuberculosis (TB) treatment. To date, other than persistently positive cultures, no biomarkers have been identified that effectively predict which TB patients are at risk for treatment relapse after apparent cure. We will recruit a prospective cohort of patients undergoing treatment for MDR TB in Seoul, Korea, using a protocol in place for serial evaluations by [18F]-fiuoro-2-deoxy-Dglucose  positron emission tomography/ computer tomography (FDG-PET/CT) during and after completion of therapy. The natural history of the post-treatment phase of TB disease will be investigated, with specific attention to identifying evidence of persistent organisms by FDG-PET/CT scan and defining biomarkers that predict PET/CT scan activity and clinical relapse. Candidate biomarkers include host transcriptome and proteome profiles, effector and memory T cell cells and polyfunctional T cells. These markers will be evaluated and correlated with treatment outcomes. The potential use of biomarker assays to monitor  treatment response for MDR TB patients, whose therapy is more toxic and for whom second line drugs are less efficacious, would facilitate determination of more evidence-based treatment durations and provide an earlier endpoint for investigation of novel therapeutics. Aim 1 will determine the association between abnormalities on FDG-PET/CT scan and relapse of TB patients after completion of treatment; Aim 2 will develop and validate a model to predict Mtb persistence and treatment relapse of MDR TB patients based on changes in biomarkers; Aim 3 will prospectively validate the most promising biomarkers as predictors of  relapse in drug-susceptible TB. Identification of FDG-PET/CT scan abnormalities associated with persistent disease will provide important insights into the biology of mycobacterial persistence in humans and lead to optimal choice of potential biomarkers to evaluate as predictors of persistent disease."
"9515427","Project Summary/Abstract - The long-term goals of the proposed research program are to provide insight into the complex dialogue that occurs each generation between humans and their microbiota during the critical period following birth. Recent research has indicated a strong correlation between outcomes of these early events and life-long health. However, the inaccessibility of colonized tissues and high diversity of the microbiota renders an in-depth study of early colonization of human tissues extremely challenging. When faced with such complex phenomena, biologists often turn to simpler model systems to provide insights into evolutionarily conserved features and reveal basic principles. To decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of bacterial associations with apical surfaces of mucosal epithelia, the proposed program exploits the binary symbiosis between the bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its squid host, Euprymna scolopes. This relatively simple association has been studied for over two decades as a model for the chronic colonization of mucosa by Gram-negative bacteria. As in humans, the squid-vibrio association begins anew each generation, requiring a `winnowing' of other environmental bacteria that results in persistent association restricted to the coevolved partners. In this system, the process of symbiosis initiation occurs across ~100 microns over minutes to hours. It can be directly imaged in its entirety using confocal microscopy, which offers the rare opportunity to define, with high temporal and spatial resolution, the reciprocal molecular and biochemical dialogue that results in the establishment of a specific, life-long beneficial symbiosis. This project brings together two collaborators, each with expertise in the biology of one of the symbiotic partners, and introduces new technology to the study of host-microbe interactions, including: Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS), which allows precision tracking of symbiont molecules into host tissues; Hybridization-Chain-Reaction Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (HCR-FISH), which enables visualization of rare transcripts in host and symbiont cells; NanoString, a new technology for simultaneous analysis of dozens to hundreds of targeted transcripts; and high-efficiency RNAseq, which produces robust transcriptional libraries from as little as 10 ng total RNA (~105 bacteria). Specific aims to be addressed are: (1) the examination of how symbiotic bacterial strain variation affects symbiosis onset and persistence; (2) the characterization of outer membrane vesicle (OMV) contents, their trafficking into host cells, and host responses to OMV cargo; and, (3) the investigation of the roles of vibrio virulence determinants in a non-pathogenic association. An understanding of the human microbiome is in its infancy, and this frontier field is currently at the stage of building paradigms. Within this context, as the squid-vibrio system has in the past, the results of the current study will shed light upon fundamental principles governing the onset of both beneficial and pathogenic associations."
"9413977","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne alphavirus that cycles directly between humans and mosquitoes and causes a debilitating febrile illness in humans on a global scale. Autochthonous transmission in the New World now has been described, with outbreaks in at least 19 countries in the Americas and over a quarter million cases in just 6 months. CHIKV disease cases have been reported to ArboNET in travelers returning to the US from the Caribbean in 29 states, as of July 1. The potential for epidemics in North and South America is high due to the ubiquitous distribution of one of its primary vectors, Aedes albopictus. Despite the possibility for infecting and causing disease in millions, specific treatments or vaccines for CHIKV are not available. A primary goal of this project is to define the molecular, genetic, immunologic, and structural characteristics of ultra-potent neutralizing human mAbs with broad activity against all genotypes of CHIKV. Additional goals include defining the mechanistic correlates of protection by these ultra-potent neutralizing mAbs. In these studies, we will elucidate how antiviral Abs with exceptional inhibitory activity exert their action in cell culture and in vivo. The approach will include high efficiency isolationof human mAbs, coupled with innovative antibody gene repertoire studies based on nextgen sequencing. Several hypotheses will be tested, including the concept that ultra-potent neutralizing activity results from features of both the antibodies (extensive mutations due to persistent CHIKV infection) and the antigen (binding to quaternary epitopes on multiple adjacent envelope proteins and blocking structural transitions critical for virus entry or release). Althoug our focus is to understand how and why ultra-potent human mAbs inhibit CHIKV, the studies likely will be relevant to general principles of antibody neutralization of many different viruses. Beyond defining the molecular and structural basis of Ab neutralization of CHIKV, these studies will generate a group of fully human mAbs that can prevent and treat CHIKV infection and persistence in mice, which could be developed in the future as a possible combination immunotherapeutic for humans. Studies in this project, while targeted against CHIKV, likely will inform future Ab-based and/or vaccine efforts against other alphaviruses that cause human disease. We have assembled a unique group of investigators, including a human Ab expert, a molecular virologist with experience in Ab-virus interactions, and two accomplished structural biologists with specific expertise in alphaviruses, including CHIKV, to pursue these studies."
"9438927","e-Cigarettes, also known as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are a rapidly growing nicotine delivery product with millions of users in the United States and worldwide. All e-cigarettes have common features: a battery; a tank containing propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin, flavoring agents, and nicotine; a microprocessor; an activating button; and, in some, a variable voltage heating element. The heating element vaporizes the solution producing liquid aerosol droplets containing nicotine. The amount of nicotine inhaled is controlled by the user by varying the voltage. There is little doubt that e-cigarettes are safer than tobacco cigarettes because they lack tobacco and combustion. However, the safety of e-cigarettes per se requires evaluation, particularly in view of recent reports that they may generate unacceptable levels of the human carcinogen formaldehyde, and our preliminary data indicating that levels of urinary biomarkers of oxidative damage and inflammation ? the F2-isoprostane 8-iso-PGF2? and the prostaglandin E2 metabolite PGEM - are the same in e- cigarette users as in cigarette smokers. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that e-cigarette use leads to formaldehyde-DNA adducts and elevated exposure to other carbonyls, and to similar levels of oxidative damage and inflammation as in smokers, and will assess toxicant and carcinogen exposure in e-cigarette users, smokers, and non-smokers. Our specific aims are: 1. Quantify exogenous [13CD2]formaldehyde-DNA adducts and unlabeled endogenous  formaldehyde-DNA adducts in tissues of rats exposed to vapor generated from e-liquids  containing [1-13CD2]propylene glycol. 2. Using samples from a prior study in which smokers stopped smoking for 12 weeks, determine the  time course of decreases in formaldehyde-DNA adducts in leukocytes, and 8-iso-PGF-2? and  PGEM in urine.3. Recruit 134 e-cigarette tank system users, 134 smokers, and 134 non-users of any e-cigarette or  tobacco product and compare levels of formaldehyde, diacetyl, and other carbonyl compounds in  saliva (before and after puffing in the e-cigarette users and smokers), formaldehyde-DNA  adducts in oral cells and leukocytes, 8-iso-PGF-2? and PGEM in urine, the serum biomarker of  inflammation C-reactive protein, as well as a panel of urinary toxicant and carcinogen biomarkers,  sampled monthly for 6 months. Only e-cigarette users who have not smoked a tobacco  cigarette for the amount of time determined to be necessary for clearance of biomarkers to non-smoker levels in Specific Aim 2 will be enrolled, and this group will include e-cigarette users who operate their devices at predominantly high and low voltages (above and below 4V) as well as some individuals who will vary the voltage of their e-cigarette system.Collectively, the results of this study will critically test our hypothesis and provide important data on the potential risks of e-cigarette use with respect to the human carcinogen formaldehyde and other carbonyl compounds, oxidative damage and inflammation, and exposure to a panel of toxicants and carcinogens."
"9456709","ABSTRACT Residual oral inflammation along with chronic systemic immune activation is an important feature in many (HIV)/Combined Antiretroviral therapy (cART) patients, and has been linked to a wide range of oral pathologies including periodontitis, erythematous candidal lesions, viral infections and oral cancer. Although cART can suppress plasma viral loads to undetectable levels, increased mortality is closely associated with mucosal immune dysbiosis and persistent viral reservoirs in lymphoid tissues. To date, however, the majority of research on immune activation has been derived from analysis of circulating quiescent T cells. How microbial products from altered oral microbiome and opportunistic pathogens contribute to immune cell alterations and oral mucosal dysbiosis is unknown. A better comprehension of this phenomenon, and various interactions between immune cells, commensal and pathogenic microbes is needed to shed light on HIV-mediated immune oral immune dysfunction. Our proposal will investigate these interactions with a specific focus on Th17 cells and Tregs, the critical subsets of CD4+ T lymphocytes that play crucial roles in maintaining the mucosal barrier integrity and preventing inflammation respectively. We hypothesize that loss of oral Th17 cells and increase in proportions of dysfunctional Tregs contribute to residual oral inflammation in HIV+ patients. We will determine the functions of interventional IL-21 in restoring Th17 cells during HIV infection. We will also define the role of TLR signaling and IL-6 in inducing Treg plasticity, generating dysfunctional Tregs and contributing to oral immune pathogenesis of HIV+ individuals. These studies will contribute to new ways of thinking about oral inflammation in HIV+ individuals, and aid in generating novel therapeutic strategies to manage HIV mediated chronic oral dysbiosis.  This multidisciplinary project supported by a robust procurement network for human tonsillar and oral tissues from HIV+ individuals will enable an unprecedented insight into HIV dependent oral mucosal inflammatory mechanisms, and is compatible with Trans-NIH FY-2016 funding priorities for HIV research that states ?Study the effect of the CD4+ T-cell pool heterogeneity in terms of differentiation .. lineage (Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, Tfh), anatomic location (blood versus lymphoid tissues versus mucosal tissues)?, as area of research priority. Most importantly, by defining the immune plasticity mechanisms in Th17 cells and Tregs during HIV+/SIV infection, the project fits well with the program objectives for RFA-DE-17-006.  "
"9414617","COLLABORATION AND SERVICE PROJECT SUMMARY  Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are  naturally occurring polydisperse linear polysaccharides that are heavily O- and N-sulfated. The interaction  between GAGs and proteins are critical for many biological processes including cell-cell and cell-matrix  interactions, cell migration and proliferation, growth factor sequestration, chemokine and cytokine activation,  microbial recognition and tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. Hundreds of HS-binding  proteins have been identified, but the oligosaccharide structures that mediate particular interactions have been  defined in only a few cases due to the structural complexity of HS. The goals of Collaboration and Service in  the Resource are to provide an expanded application of our technologies to the scientific community. The  Resource has a long and extensive record of collaborations and service with outside investigators. While a  number of the collaboration and service projects involve the isolation of GAGs from cells or tissues,  compositional disaccharide analysis using SAX-HPLC, HPAEC or ESI-MSn, oligosaccharide mapping by LC-  ESI-MS, and structural characterization of individual oligosaccharides by LC, MSn, and NMR, they extend to a  broad range of other aspects including synthesis, and cellular and structural biology. The projects can also  involve development of MD simulations through GLYCAM web-tools or synthesis of oligosaccharides. A cross  section of these is represented in the projects highlighted in the Attachment to this section. Building on our  reputation in this area, we will continue to expand on technologies already developed for C&S activities with  added capabilities emanating from the TR&D and DBP components in the next funding period, thus enhancing  our offerings to the broader scientific community. Within these broader principles, three specific areas in which  we will augment our capabilities include: (Aim 1) development of a heparan sulfate array platform using  chemical synthesis of well-defined heparan sulfate oligosaccharide structures, (Aim 2) development of  GLYCAM online tool enhancements including enhancements in the tools for GAG studies, capabilities for in  silico screening of virtual GAG/glycan arrays, in silico conjugation of GAGs to proteins for modeling  proteoglycans, and capabilities for short MD simulations of GAG-protein complexes, and (Aim 3)  implementation of new analytical tools like MS capabilities including cutting edge technologies in throughput,  sensitivity, and our structure determination using the proposed Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. GAG  characterization will also be enhanced with new NMR technologies developed at the CCRC using 2-  dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC experiments. The 13C optimized cryogenic probe being requested will enhance  access to high resolution 13C measurements on GAGs providing improved resolution in the carbon dimension  over what can be obtained in the more sensitive 2D HSQC experiments, and also visualize non-protonated  carbons."
"9327039","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using current guidelines, only one-quarter of patients receiving an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) receive appropriate ICD therapy within 5 years. PAREPET (Prediction of ARrhythmic Events with Positron Emission Tomography) identified four independent risk factors that predict SCA or ICD equivalent (SCAE) in subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy. At optimized cut-points, the absence of these risk factors identified 38% of the cohort at very low risk of SCAE (<1%/yr). This is actually lower than the SCA rate for patients with coronary disease and mild left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (1.5-2%/yr) who are not candidates for an ICD. Thus, our goal is to prospectively determine whether these risk factors can identify a subgroup at low enough risk of SCAE to have an ICD safely withheld.  PAREPET confirmed that denervated myocardium quantified with 11C-meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED) PET could predict time to SCAE. A post-hoc multivariate analysis subsequently determined that among those on optimal medical therapy, denervated myocardium, LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) were the only independent predictors of SCAE. These parameters were independent of other PET, clinical, and demographic variables including infarct size, ejection fraction, and functional class. However, before proposing a very large clinical tria to test the potential for withholding ICD therapy among subjects predicted to be at low risk, a number of important details must be established. First, in PAREPET LVEDVI and BNP were found to be complementary to denervated myocardium based on a retrospective analysis. Thus, the independence and significance of these variables requires prospective validation. Second, HED uses a short half-life isotope that is ideal for limiting radiation exposure but requires local synthesis including a cyclotron. Clinical translation will therefore require a longer lived isotope that can be regionally produced. Finally, potentially withholding ICD therapy will require an approach for dynamic risk assessment in order to identify subsequent changes in risk. These issues will be addressed with the following Specific Aims:  In subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy on optimal medical therapy who receive an ICD for the primary prevention of SCA: Specific Aim #1 - prospectively validate whether LVEDVI and/or BNP are significant predictors of SCAE and are independent of denervated myocardium. Specific Aim #2 - determine if the 18F-labeled norepinephrine analog LMI1195 can reliably quantify denervated myocardium. Specific Aim #3 - determine whether repeat testing after a cardiac hospitalization predicts an increased risk of SCAE.  This proposal will provide preliminary data for a prospective trial to test whether primary prevention ICDs can be safely withheld in subjects predicted to be at very low risk of SCAE, with cardiac hospitalizations expected provide a warning signal to reassess risk. Such a strategy would not only improve the alignment of device costs and complications with potential ICD benefit, but would almost certainly be cost-effective."
"9529970","Adolescence is the period between childhood and adulthood during which cognitive, emotional, and social behaviors develop substantially. As such, adolescence is a period of both opportunity and vulnerability, and mental illness onset typically occurs during adolescence. The factors mediating a successful transition through adolescence range from social to biological. One factor that has received increased investigation in recent years is the timing of puberty. Whether individuals undergo pubertal development early or late relative to their peers increases risk for mental illness. Scientific explanations of the relationship between pubertal timing and mental illness tend to focus on the social and emotional consequences of developing earlier or later than one's peers. However, these models do not consider the role gonadal steroid hormones play in shaping the developing nervous system and behavior. We've proposed that nervous system sensitivity to gonadal steroid hormones decreases across adolescent development. In this framework, the developing adolescent brain is a moving target for the effects of gonadal steroid hormones, and shifts in pubertal timing may alter the course of brain development toward increased vulnerability. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that sensitivity to the organizing actions of gonadal steroid hormones decreases across postnatal development. This hypothesis predicts that adult behavioral outcomes will differ between groups receiving steroid hormone treatments before, during or after the normal time of puberty. Our strategy will be to vary the postnatal age at which rats are exposed to an 18-day period of testosterone (males) or estradiol (females) and then assess anhedonia, working memory, anxiety, and social behavior in adulthood (following hormone replacement). The results of this study will advance our understanding of the neurobiological principles governing adolescent brain development in both males and females. Furthermore, this work will have implications for sex-biased psychopathologies associated with deviations in pubertal timing such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders."

"9527420","Project Summary/Abstract  This mentored career development award (K08) proposal describes the research and educational plans for the candidate, Andrew Janowski MD. His long-term goal is to discover and characterize viral causes of central nervous system (CNS) infection. One entity, encephalitis, is often caused by infectious pathogens, but frequently an etiology cannot be identified despite extensive clinical testing. A subset of encephalitis cases are anticipated to be caused by novel viruses or viruses with an unappreciated neurotropism. Dr. Janowski has previously used next-generation sequencing technology to discover a novel family of viruses named statoviruses and has also increased the number of known RNA bacteriophages by over six-fold. He will apply these skills to identify novel pathogens in CNS infections and to characterize their biology.  Astrovirus VA1 (VA1), a virus originally discovered by Dr. Janowski's mentor, David Wang PhD, has been identified as an emerging cause of encephalitis. However, studies of the fundamental biology of this virus has been precluded by the lack of an experimental model of infection. Dr. Janowski has developed the first cell culture model of VA1 infection in vitro, and now the biology of VA1 infection can be elucidated using this system. In Aim 1, he will develop an in vitro model of VA1 CNS infection. He will define host expression profiles upon infection and determine if there are any VA1 strain specific cellular tropisms. The host immune response to VA1 infection is also poorly defined, but preliminary evidence suggests that interferon-? is induced by VA1 and addition of exogenous interferon reduces VA1 replication. For Aim 2, Dr. Janowski will use a CRISPR/Cas- 9 approach to define pattern recognition receptors and interferon stimulated genes that mediate the interferon response. In Aim 3, Dr. Janowski will use a neutralization assay to define the seroprevalence of neutralizing antibodies to VA1. He will also use a qRT-PCR assay to define the burden of CNS diseases caused by VA1, as he has a repository of clinical specimens from patients with acute CNS diseases.  Characterizing VA1 will prepare Dr. Janowski to transition as an independent physician-scientist by the end of the K08 award period. His career development will be overseen by his co-mentors, Drs. David Wang and Gregory Storch, with Drs. Robyn Klein, Herbert ?Skip? Virgin, Mike Diamond, and David Hunstad forming an illustrious advisory committee that will assist in career development and experimental design. In addition, Dr. Janowski will complete a master's degree in clinical investigation in translational medicine at Washington University in St Louis to enhance his formal scientific training. He has the support of a world-class institution, an outstanding group of mentors and advisors, a well-developed educational plan, and a research project that will provide unique and provocative results regarding the biology of VA1. The results of this K08 proposal will not only build upon host-virus interactions in CNS infections but it will launch the independent research career of Dr. Janowski."
"9412175","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) infection leads to a spectrum of neurological and cognitive abnormalities, known collectively as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HAND remains prevalent, particularly in its milder forms, despite effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The pathogenesis of HAND is involves HIV-infected perivascular macrophages and microglia, whose activation leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other soluble factors toxic to neurons. One factor that may be involved in macrophage-mediated HIV neurotoxicity is cathepsin B, a cysteine protease. We recently demonstrated that monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) secreted, cathepsin B has increased neurotoxic activity in vitro. In studies of our Hispanic women cohort, we observed increased expression of both cathepsin B and cystatin B in monocytes of women with HAD on cART with no comorbid conditions. Studies are needed to determine the role of monocyte cathepsin B, cystatins B and C, as potential biomarkers for HAND by flow cytometry. A pilot study of limited samples post-mortem brain tissue indicated that cathepsin B is also upregulated in the CNS of patients with HAND [1]. New preliminary studies of MDM secreted interactome demonstrate that cathepsin B interacts with MMP-9 in uninfected cells but this interaction disappears in HIV infection and develops a new interaction with serum amyloid P component (SAPC), related to amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies in the literature also suggest that cathepsin B might be involved in amyloid-beta (A¿)- related inflammatory response, which results in neuronal death. This new role of cathepsin B in HIV infection deserves further studies. Our long-term goal is to determine the potential of the cathepsin B system as a diagnostic tool and therapeutic target for HAND and the mechanisms whereby cathepsin B dysregulation causes neuronal cell dysfunction and death. Our central hypothesis is that increased secretion of monocyte-derived cathepsin B after HIV infection causes neuronal dysfunction and death, and contributes to the pathogenesis of HAND. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because the role of the cathepsin B as a potential early blood biomarker of HAND has not been explored. Understanding how dysregulation of the cathepsin B interacting proteins in the HIV-infected MDM secretome contributes to neurotoxicity using primary human neurons could elucidate novel targets for therapy. The specific aims are: 1) Create a longitudinal expression profile of cathepsin B and cystatins B and C in CD14+ monocytes from HAND patients. 2) Characterize of the interactome of MDM-secreted cathepsin B and its involvement in HIV-induced neuronal death; 3) Determine the translational significance of cathepsin B interactome in human post-mortem brain tissue. The proposed studies will significantly advance the HIV field by providing new clinical diagnostic tools, new pathways, and possible complementary therapies against HAND."
"9469292","Abstract Cardiovascular disease remains the single greatest cause of mortality in America. In those aged 65 or older, cardiovascular disease accounts for a proportionally greater mortality rate than other age groups. Changes in cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling, particularly a prolonged Ca2+ signal resulting in a prolonged relaxation time, can cause age-dependent cardiac dysfunction. Work showing increased left ventricular filling pressures and volumes with age provides evidence that cardiomyocytes in aged hearts bear greater longitudinal stretch than their young counterparts. My sponsor?s laboratory has novel data showing age-dependent upregulation of the stretch- activated cation channel Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) in the aged myocardium. Using Young (3-4 month) and Aged (24-26 month) mice in combination with genetic (inducible cardiac-specific TRPV4 overexpression) and pharmacologic (TRPV4 inhibition) approaches, this proposal tests the central hypothesis that mechanical stretch activates TRPV4 in cardiomyocytes of the aged heart, leading to enhanced ECC and impaired diastolic relaxation. Aim 1 investigates the role of TRPV4 in stretch-induced Ca2+ homeostasis at the isolated cell level. Cardiomyocytes of Young and Aged mice will be subjected to physiologic, longitudinal stretch while measuring sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry (Mn2+ quench of fura-2), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ loading (fluo-5F, with caffeine application), spontaneous ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ release events (fluo-4), and simultaneous ratiometric Ca2+ (fura-2) and force during electric field stimulation. Aim 2 extends methodology to the level of the whole organ, as isolated hearts of Young and Aged mice will be subjected to increases in preload to examine pressure development. Transgenic mice expressing the GCaMP6f Ca2+ sensor in cardiomyocytes will be utilized to examine cardiomyocyte Ca2+ dynamics in response to elevations in preload. This proposal evaluates TRPV4 as a novel target for therapeutic modulation of cardiomyocyte Ca2+ homeostasis in the aged heart. Furthermore, this proposal will give the applicant valuable training and perspective, and serve as a foundation for a future career in cardiovascular research."

"9468056","Abstract  Hematopoiesis relies on the proper function of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), in their capacity for both self-renewal and differentiation. Genetic lesions in these cell populations can give rise to myeloid malignancies including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Myeloproliferative neoplasms, which result in the expansion of mature myeloid compartments, commonly harbor aberrations or mutations involving the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL are found in the majority of MPN cases, however cooperating co-driver mutations and disease modifiers are relatively poorly understood. Current treatment options for Philadelphia-chromosome-negative (Ph-) MPNs provide symptomatic relief and do not significantly alter overall survival. Moreover, leukemic transformation to AML is a common occurrence in Ph- MPN patients, and is thought to be due to acquisition of additional mutations which ultimately lead to a dramatic reduction in patient survival. The process of leukemic transformation of MPN to AML still remains unclear, and gaining insight into the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon may provide openings for new interventions for preventing disease progression.  We have discovered that loss of the Nol3 gene in mice leads to an MPN-like disease closely resembling primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Paradoxical to its canonical functions in repressing apoptosis, deletion of Nol3 results in an increased expansion and cycling of HSPCs in the bone marrow and spleen, suggesting a novel role for Nol3 within the hematopoietic system. Our analyses show that Nol3 is frequently downregulated or deleted in patients with PMF and other myeloid malignancies, and our data provides a link between Nol3 expression and JAK/STAT activation in MPN and AML cells, implicating Nol3 in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.  Our proposal seeks to (1) characterize the molecular role of Nol3 in hematopoiesis by defining molecular functions and subcellular localization, as well as identifying functional binding partners, (2) relate Nol3 loss to human disease by dissecting the role of Nol3 within the JAK/STAT pathway and identifying critical functional domains, and (3) gain insight into cooperativity between Nol3 loss and mutational drivers in MPN and transformation to AML. Our study will not only provide a novel and robust model for studying myeloid malignancies, but will also help define for the first time a role for Nol3 as a myeloid tumor suppressor and key component of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. More importantly, our studies will also link Nol3 to human myeloid malignancy, which will provide a deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of disease."
"9635881","Pediatric cardiovascular disorders, which comprise congenital heart defects (CHD) and myocardial and conduction system diseases, remain highly challenging due to cardiac co-morbidities and premature mortality. As most of these disorders are genetic, efforts over the past 30 years have focused on identifying their causal mutations. Particularly for Mendelian traits such as Noonan syndrome and related disorders (the RASopathies), this has been highly successful. Newer genomic technologies have accelerated gene discovery for pediatric cardiovascular disorders, including genetically complex ones. These genetic discoveries are improving care through more accurate diagnosis, better prognostication, and refinement of clinical trial design. What has not occurred with rare exception is the development of novel therapies based on the new understanding of disease pathogenesis enabled by these gene discoveries. Finding therapies for pediatric cardiovascular disorders will be challenging because the biological targets are generally central to cell homeostasis (e.g., RAS/MAP kinase signaling) so cannot be completely inhibited for long periods without incurring side effects that would outweigh their benefits. For this R35 mechanism, I and my outstanding co- investigators with relevant expertise intend to address this gap using a drug development pipeline that begins with high-throughput screening to overcome pupal lethality in Drosophila melanogaster models of disease with a chemical library that covers druggable space (n=14,400) using 96-well plates and robotics. Screening in whole animals is performed agnostically and has the putative advantage of providing a simultaneous read out of efficacy and toxicity. We provide preliminary data showing that we have already achieved this using a fly RAF1 mutant model of Noonan syndrome with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Subsequent steps with fruit flies include confirmation of initial hits in vials, determining efficacy against adult fly phenotypes such as rough eye, ectopic wing veins and heart hypertrophy. Back-up libraries for the candidate compounds, typically 60-80 chemical neighbors, will be culled for ones with most desirable drug traits and then screened in the fly models. Using a defined set of fruit fly deficiency lines, targets and anti-targets will be established to enable further rounds of rational pharmacology. ADME studies will be used to reduce potential for drug-drug interactions. In parallel, we will pursue repurposing of FDA-approved drugs using library screening with fruit fly models and systems pharmacogenomics. Leading compounds and drugs will then be tested against phenotypes in human induced pluripotent stem cell lines with the disease-causing mutation for efficacy. The most promising drugs will then be tested in existing mouse models (e.g., HCM in Raf1 mutant mice) using appropriate endpoints. Taken as a whole, the approach proposed will significantly advance the identification of novel therapeutics for pediatric cardiovascular diseases, starting with the RASopathies and later for other traits. If robust, this will provide a paradigm that can be adopted for other genetic traits of interest to the NHLBI."

PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of the ENCORE (Encyclopedia of RNA Elements) project is to develop a foundational, functional map of protein-RNA interactions of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) encoded in the human genome, and the RNA elements they bind to across the transcriptome. These RNA elements, when expressed, form the basis of co- and post- transcriptional regulation of human genes. Our strategy consists of developing and integrating a physical map of 300 RBPs in two different human cell lines with transcriptome-wide measurements of the effects of depleting these RBPs, their localization patterns and their binding preferences independent of co-factor associations. In this data production core, we will capitalize on the highly efficient data production pipeline we have established over the past four years to generate RNA bind- n-seq, RNA-seq, protein localization and eCLIP data for an additional 300 RBPs. When combined with the data we generated over the past four years, these efforts will culminate in a comprehensive map of the functional RNA elements recognized by essentially all RBPs expressed in two human cell lines, representing approximately half of the known complement of human RBPs. In summary, the data we will produce in this project will enable a more systematic and comprehensive understanding of the role of RBPs and RNA biology in the contribution to human biology and disease."
"9473636","Abstract Blood disorders could be cured by transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, because of lack of matched donors, many patients cannot undergo curative therapy. Thus, there is an unmet demand for engineering autologous HSPCs. The long-term goal of this project is to enable conversion of readily accessible autologous adult endothelial cells (ECs) into engraftable HSPCs. To enable this, we need to uncover the niche signals that drive the birth of human HSCs. To this end, we have devised a tractable in vitro method to reprogram readily accessible human and mouse adult ECs into hematopoietic cells. In this approach, we expressed four transcription factors (TFs), FOSB, GFI1, Runx1 and SPI1 (FGRS) in adult primary ECs along with coculture with vascular niche, to reprogram adult ECs into engraftable human HSPCs (rEC-HSPCs). While human rEC-HSPCs could engraft NSG mice, we could not assess whether these cells could give rise to functional T cells. Therefore, we isolated adult lung ECs from Runx1-IRES-GFP reporter mouse for conversion and to tract and modulate the emergence of HSPCs. We show that transient FGRS transduction of Runx1-IRES-GFP ECs along with vascular niche induction, over a 28 day period, enable transition through 3 steps of Induction-Specification-Expansion to generate repopulating mouse rEC- HSPCs. Notably, shutting off FGRS on day 28 before transplantation of CD45.2+ rEC-HSPCs was key to enable multi-lineage engraftment in 1o and 2o CD45.1+ lethally irradiated recipients. Engrafted T cells restore immune response in Rag1-/- mice eliciting adaptive immune response. Single cell clonal and limiting dilution transplantation of day 28 rEC-HSPCs show that these cells are capable of clonal expansion and contain 1/557 competitive repopulating units (CRU) thereby subsets of HSPCs represent long-term rEC-HSCs. Thus, we hypothesize that transient expression of FGRS in adult ECs along with induction by vascular and stromal niche signals will enable deciphering the hierarchy of signals that orchestrate accelerated transition of ECs to abundant engraftable long-term immunocompetent human rEC-HSPCs. These approaches set up the stage for generation of human rEC-HSCs. We will test this hypothesis by examining the following specific aims: 1) Employ non-integrative modified RNA (modRNA) delivery of FGRS TFs into adult human ECs to augment the efficiency, efficacy and safety of conversion of adult human ECs into rEC-HSPCs. 2) Identify tissue- specific specialized human vascular and stromal cell niches that orchestrate the induction, specification, and expansion of FGRS-transduced ECs into abundant immunocompetent long-term engraftable human rEC- HSPCs. 3) Decipher the role of human vascular and stromal niche derived signals, including Cxcl12:Cxcr4/Cxcr7 and BMP4/TGF-?1 in stepwise conversion of human adult ECs into rEC-HSPCs.! Collectively, our mechanistic studies will not only identify ontological pathways involved in differentiation of ECs to rEC-HSPCs, but also translate the potential of engineered autologous HSPCs to the clinical setting. !"
"9467249","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that affect several organs. SLE affects millions of individuals, with women and minorities disproportionately burdened, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite considerable progress made towards understanding the disease and the identification of the central roles plasma cells (PCs) and autoreactive antibody secreting cells (ASCs) play in SLE pathogenesis, most therapeutic approaches remain broadly immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, or palliative, which highlights the urgent need for novel therapies. Due to the essential role of auto-antibodies in the amplification of auto-immunity, a goal in lupus therapy is the elimination of auto-reactive ASCs. Karyopharm Therapeutics pioneered the development of Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export (SINE), and is investigating their utility in auto-immune diseases in collaboration with the Anolik laboratory at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Together we have shown that inhibiting nuclear export with KPT-350, a SINE, strongly and selectively ablates auto-reactive PCs by targeting pathways that are critical for their generation, survival, and recruitment into inflamed kidneys. Specifically, we have shown that KPT-350 selectively inhibits the production of auto-reactive ASCs and has a compelling effect on B-cell germinal center formation/stability, prevents expansion of memory T follicular helper cells, and markedly reduces mRNA expression of molecules critical for survival and recruitment of auto-reactive ASCs. In the proposed project, we will further define the efficacy of SINE treatment and identify viable combination and maintenance therapies to accelerate the translation of these novel compounds into SLE clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will define the optimal dosage conditions to restrain murine lupus progression after withdrawal of SINE therapy by (i) determining the duration of the SINE effect and defining the need for maintenance therapy, and (ii) defining the duration of the SINE effect on NF?B inhibition. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of combination modality therapy on murine autoreactive PCs by (i) evaluating the efficacy and duration of SINE and proteasome inhibitors on autoimmune disease relapse, (ii) determining the effects of single vs combination therapy on PCs in SLE, and (iii) defining the impact of factors involved in the maintenance of autoreactive PCs. Finally, Aim 3 will expand our studies to human SLE by (i) defining the role of NF?B survival signals in SLE patient PCs, (ii) examining the effect SINE treatment has on SLE PC survival, (iii) defining the signals required for SLE bone marrow (BM) PC survival, (iv) identifying the source of PC survival factors in the BM, and (v) demonstrating that SINE therapy inhibits B-cell differentiation. Our goal is to delineate an efficacious combination dosing strategy, using a novel approach that targets key synergistic pathways in SLE disease pathogenesis, with the long term goal of delivering an improved therapy for SLE. Successful completion of these studies will allow us to pursue commercialization objectives and move SINE compounds into extensive preclinical safety testing."
"9193581","The proposed research seeks to determine whether text messages/messaging (TM) or a mobile application (app), compared with an educational website-control provided to all Veterans, can improve adherence to antiplatelet therapy among patients following acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention (ACS/PCI). Adherence to antiplatelet medications is critical to prevent life- threatening complications (i.e., stent thrombosis); yet rates of non-adherence range from 21-57% by 12 months. Mobile technology through TM or mobile apps is a practical and inexpensive strategy to promote behavior change and enhance medication adherence. The three specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine preferences for content and frequency of TM to promote medication adherence through focus groups; 2) determine the most patient-centered app to promote adherence through a content analysis of all commercially available apps for medication adherence and focus groups centered on usability; and 3) compare adherence to antiplatelet medications in 225 Veterans post ACS/PCI through a randomized clinical trial. Participants will be randomized to either TM, mobile app, or website-control group. The focus groups will be stratified by low/high mobile phone use and sex. In addition, the proposed work will provide Dr. Park with the mentorship and experience necessary to establish herself as an early career investigator in the fields of cardiovascular disease prevention and mobile health research. Dr. Park's primary career goal is to become an independent nurse investigator who applies novel technology for patient-centered behavioral interventions to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for cardiac patients and Veterans. Dr. Park has assembled an outstanding interdisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in the required areas of training. Eileen Collins, PhD, RN will serve as Primary Nurse Mentor; Mary Whooley, MD will serve as VA On-Site Mentor; and Janet Shim, PhD will serve as Qualitative Research Mentor. In addition, John Boscardin, PhD will conduct all quantitative statistical analyses related to the study. Consultants include Yoshimi Fukuoka, RN, PhD (expert in mobile health strategies) and Dr. Michael Ho (expert in medication adherence and cardiovascular disease). Susan Woods, MD, MPH (Director of Patient Experience, Connected Health, Office of Information and Analytics, VHA) will serve as a collaborator, particularly in relationship to our use of ?Annie,? the new VA automated TM program with a goal to help patients take a more active role in their health. The Nursing Research Initiative will provide Dr. Park with an exceptional opportunity to receive the mentorship and experience necessary to prepare a strong scientific foundation for a compelling Investigator Initiated Research proposal to evaluate clinical outcomes (i.e., cardiac morbidity and mortality) through a multi-site full scale RCT. Determining the efficacy of mobile technology through a Veteran-designed protocol to promote medication adherence will have a significant impact on Veteran health and public health, particularly for individuals with chronic diseases that require strict medication adherence.  "
"9416107","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."
"9408634","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric retinal detachment is a leading cause of childhood blindness in developed countries. One of the common characteristics of inherited or acquired pediatric retinal detachments is the subretinal exudation of fluid, hemorrhage and lipid, causing separation of photoreceptors from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the death of photoreceptors. However, a significant portion of children re-gain limited vision once the retina re-attaches after the resolution of subretinal exudate, which indicates that some photoreceptors are able to survive the prolonged separation from the RPE. The primary aim of this research study is to characterize the neuroprotective pathways regulating the survival mechanisms to keep photoreceptors alive despite persistent ischemia and toxicity. The long-term goal of this work is to design therapeutic agents to enhance intrinsic neuroprotective pathways to improve visual recovery.  The over-arching hypothesis we are using to formulate this research proposal is that activation of retinal neuroprotective pathways inhibit photoreceptor apoptosis and prevent outer retinal degeneration during periods of pediatric exudative retinal detachment. We are proposing to identify these neuroprotective pathways using clinical samples from pediatric patients with exudative retinal detachment and characterizing them in a rodent model of exudative retinal detachment. We will test our central hypothesis with three specific aims: 1) Targeted analysis of retinal neuroprotective factors in pediatric exudative retinal detachment; 2) Functional analysis of neuroprotective proteins in rodent subretinal hemorrhage, an animal model for exudative retinal detachment; 3) Identification of novel neuroprotective and apoptotic pathways activated in pediatric exudative retinal detachment using human proteomics.  My academic appointment as a pediatric retina specialist provides the ideal environment to translate clinical problems into research questions and transform research findings into clinical tools. As a faculty member at the University of Michigan, my clinical duties will include treating children with pediatric retinal disorders and my research program will explore the neuroprotective networks that regulate photoreceptor survival in diseased retinas. My ultimate goal as a physician-scientist is to develop new therapeutic agents to improve vision in children with retinal diseases. The Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and the University of Michigan has a world-class faculty and facilities. I will benefit from thoughtful hands-on mentoring by experienced scientists and clinicians who are deeply committed to my success. This training will be further enhanced by my interaction with the leading experts in the field of pediatric retina from Oakland University and Beaumont Eye Institute. Some of the proposed experiments involve the use of proteomics and bioinformatics. The new expertise gained in these areas through hands-on biotechnology training courses and didactic sessions will allow me to apply the power of proteomics to pediatric retinal diseases."
"9624904","Abstract The goal of this proposal is to provide a foundation to prepare the applicant, Dr. Tim Heden, for a career as an independent scientist. Dr. Heden has previously undergone Ph.D. training in the field of nutrition and exercise physiology and has completed his first year as a postdoctoral trainee studying phospholipid metabolism. The proposed training plan will enhance the applicant?s scientific skills and better equip him to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent scientist. The proposed research will identify the role of skeletal muscle mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis in respiratory capacity and substrate metabolism in skeletal muscle. PE is synthesized by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD) that resides in the inner- membrane of mitochondria. Preliminary data in mice show that exercise training increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial PE content and PSD expression, whereas an 8-wk HFD reduced mitochondrial PE content without changing PSD expression. These findings suggest mitochondrial PE may mediate the differential metabolic phenotype between muscles from exercise-trained and HFD-fed mice. To better understand the biological function of skeletal muscle PSD, we performed preliminary mechanistic experiments to examine the effects of PSD knockdown in C2C12 myotubes. A lentivirus-mediated knockdown of PSD in these myotubes reduced mitochondrial PE content, maximal respiration, fatty acid oxidation, and complex II activity, but also increased fission, mitophagy, and glucose utilization. These data suggest that mitochondrial PE biosynthesis directly regulates skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity and substrate metabolism. To gain better insight into the role of skeletal muscle mitochondrial PE biosynthesis in vivo, we generated mice with skeletal muscle- specific knockout of PSD (PSD-MKO). In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle mitochondrial PE modulates cellular respiration, and its absence results in mice that have low aerobic capacity and are more prone to developing insulin resistance. Data from these studies will provide fundamental insights into the regulation of skeletal muscle respiration and substrate metabolism and introduce mitochondrial PE as a potential key player in metabolic disease development."
"9560005","ABSTRACT: Eliciting broad and potent HIV-specific neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses represents a holy grail of HIV vaccine efforts. To date, our understanding of the potential of the human immune system to generate such responses comes from the study of a subset of HIV-infected individuals who generate broad Nab responses as a result of a dominant monoclonal response. In contrast to the singly infected individuals who have been the topic of these previous studies, there is limited data on people who are superinfected with HIV and acquire two distinct strains of the virus from different partners. We have shown that superinfected individuals have broad Nab responses that cannot be explained by a monoclonal response to the known HIV epitopes. Our preliminary detailed study of one individual suggests that superinfection leads to a polyclonal response that results from distinct responses to the two infecting viral strains. We hypothesize that the complex dynamic between viruses in superinfection may contribute to the unique polyclonal response. To address this hypothesis, we propose to take advantage of our well-characterized cohort of superinfection, which represents the largest collection of cases identified to date. Among these individuals, we have identified several with broadly neutralizing antibody responses that do not map to a single known epitope target. We propose to isolate monoclonal antibodies from these individuals and determine the basis for the breadth of their response and whether the response is polyclonal. We will define the epitopes of the antibodies and the role that the initial and superinfecting virus played in eliciting them. We will also determine the evolutionary process that led to these responses. These studies represent a unique opportunity to understand how to elicit a polyclonal response to HIV, which may present a higher barrier to escape and resistance than a monoclonal response."
"9417678","PROJECT SUMMARY In recent years, a massive increase in the rates of antibiotic resistant bacteria has been observed in clinical settings, causing significant concern from both the scientific community and government agencies. Among the pathogens causing these alarming infections is Acinetobacter baumannii, a microorganism that has developed resistance to almost all available antibiotics. Its extreme genome plasticity, largely facilitated by horizontal genetic transfer (HGT) processes, has contributed to its remarkable antibiotic-resistance phenotype. Transformation seems to be a particularly important HGT mechanism in this bacterium. However, the environmental signals triggering competence for natural transformation, the putative effectors involved in this process, and the molecular basis of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Using the A. baumannii A118 clinical isolate as a model, the proposed project will examine the role of human host products as chemical inducers of DNA uptake. Considering our preliminary data, which show that different albumins cause a significant increase in the level of transformation frequency, this study will examine the role of Human Serum Albumin (HSA) and albumin-derived peptides in the development of bacterial competence and the uptake of foreign DNA (Aim 1). Moreover, we will determine the effects of HSA using a whole-genome transcriptional profiling approach in A118 (Aim 2). Through this last approach, we expect to identify genes and RNA regulators involved in natural transformation. This knowledge will provide critical insights into the molecular and cellular mechanism this pathogen uses to acquire resistance genes. Future studies can then use these findings to develop novel approaches to treat severe Acinetobacter human infections, particularly those caused by emerging multidrug-resistant isolates."

"9414613","TR&D1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are  naturally occurring polydisperse linear polysaccharides that are heavily O- and N-sulfated. The interaction  between GAGs and proteins are critical for many biological processes including cell-cell and cell-matrix  interactions, cell migration and proliferation, growth factor sequestration, chemokine and cytokine activation,  microbial recognition and tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. Hundreds of HS-binding  proteins have been identified, but the oligosaccharide structure that mediates a particular interaction has been  defined in only a few cases due to the structural complexity of HS. We will address these deficiencies by  developing an integrated Technology Research and Development (TR&D1) project for ligand identification  for GAG binding proteins. GAGs from various sources will be partially fragmented and the resulting  oligosaccharides employed for affinity purification using proteins of interest. The structures of HS  oligosaccharides that bind with high affinity will be determined by novel mass spectrometric approaches.  Putative ligands and structural analogs will be obtained by a modular synthetic approach and the resulting  compounds will be employed to obtain structure activity relationships by binding and cellular activation studies.  Targeted subsets of high affinity ligands will be prepared in sufficient amounts for further structural and  biochemical characterization by methods described in other TR&Ds in this proposal. The validity of the  methodology will be examined using a number of DBPs and collaborative projects. As the technologies mature,  they will be incorporated in the services provided by CCRC. Specific aims include: Aim 1. Identification of  the Structures of HS Oligosaccharides by Chemical Derivatization and LC MS/MS Analysis, including  Improved methods for generation of oligosaccharide libraries from full-length GAG chains, identification of  ligands for GAG-protein interactions using LC-MS/MS sequencing and screening of shotgun oligosaccharide  arrays, whole heparanome sequencing, Aim 2. FTICR-MS Approaches for HS Ligand Identification using  high performance MS for HS ligand identification, and Aim 3. Modular Synthesis of HS Oligosaccharides  and HS Array Development using the parallel combinatorial synthesis and development of HS  oligosaccharide arrays for high throughput screening."
"9430697","PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 Career Development Award details a four-year training program to advance Dr. Samelson-Jones? career goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist focused on leveraging molecular insights of biological processes into new therapeutics for children with congenital blood disorders. During the award period, Dr. Samelson-Jones will continue developing his expertise in coagulation biochemistry, acquire new scientific skills, deepen his knowledge of molecular and cellular immunology, and advance his translational capabilities. Under the guidance of his mentor, Dr. Mortimer Ponz, and co-mentor, Dr. Valder Arruda, these training objectives will be met by a combination of didactic course work, participation in seminar series, research experience, and mentoring by his advisory committee. His advisory committee is composed of world- renowned scientists with extensive mentoring experience and diverse and complementary scientific expertise including Drs. Sriram Krishnaswamy, Rodney Camire, and Michael Milone. The scientific proposal is aimed at addressing the current limitations of therapies for hemophilia B (HB). HB is due to an inheritable deficiency in coagulation Factor IX (FIX) activity. The current standard-of-care in the developed world for HB is to replace the missing FIX with intravenous infusions, but there are also several ongoing early phase gene therapy trials. Recently, it was demonstrated that the incorporation of the hyperactive FIX variant, R338L into a gene therapeutic partially mitigates previously identified efficacy limitations without additional safety concerns. This result emphasizes the potential of hyperactive FIX variants as gene, protein, or cell therapeutics for HB. Dr. Samelson-Jones? proposal focuses on identifying and carefully characterizing new FIX variants with increased activity. He has developed a rational strategy to identify new hyperactive FIX variants by specifically testing substitutions at positions that are 1) evolutionarily conserved; 2) absent from the HB database; and 3) structurally important for protease function. This approach has already identified several new hyperactive FIX variants. The activity of one new variant, FIX-LK, exceeds the activity of FIX-R338L by over 2 fold. In Aim 1, additional FIX variants will be identified and biochemically characterized with recombinant FIX protein. The in vivo efficacy of the best performing new variant will be comprehensively evaluated as protein and gene therapeutics in a HB mouse model in Aim 2. In Aim 3, the safety of the most promising new variants is assessed. The immunogenicity and thrombogenicity of new FIX variants is compared to wild-type FIX after provocative challenges in novel HB mouse models."
"9428819","PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed K23 Career Development Award will enable Jennifer Woo Baidal, MD, MPH to establish an independent research career with expertise in childhood obesity and pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Dr. Woo Baidal is a pediatric gastroenterologist whose long-term goal is to translate epidemiologic and patient-oriented research findings to interventions to reduce childhood obesity and NAFLD in vulnerable populations, but further training is required to accomplish this goal. Thus, she has assembled a team of mentors to fulfill her immediate goal for advanced training in (1) diagnostic research principles in relation to pediatric NAFLD; (2) epidemiologic research including cohort design and implementation; (3) quantitative research including longitudinal data analysis; (4) genetic and genomic research; and (5) research dissemination and professional development. Pediatric NAFLD is a serious complication of childhood obesity and the most common chronic pediatric liver disease worldwide. NAFLD comprises a spectrum of phenotypes including hepatic steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and fibrosis/cirrhosis. Until recently, a major barrier to advancing understanding of risk factors for pediatric NAFLD has been lack of non-invasive diagnostic modalities that are practical in children. Transient elastography is a FDA-approved, non-invasive tool that simultaneously measures hepatic steatosis and fibrosis at the point-of-care, and is widely used in adults to monitor disease progression and treatment response. The candidate?s preliminary research supports the ability of transient elastography to diagnosis steatosis and fibrosis in children, thus allowing longitudinal studies of the emergence and progression of pediatric NAFLD in children with overweight and obesity. The proposed research consists of two inter-related aims to (1) complete a full-scale validation study for transient elastography in a pediatric setting and (2) use transient elastography to test specific dietary, behavioral, and biologic hypotheses related to etiology and progression of NAFLD in childhood. This research will leverage two existing cohorts at Columbia University Medical Center and will establish a cohort of 400 children at risk for NAFLD as a platform for future R01 applications. Successful completion of this project will shed new light on mechanisms that lead to development of pediatric NAFLD in children with overweight/obesity, and provide Dr. Woo Baidal the necessary training and experience to develop an independent research program focused on reduction of pediatric NAFLD in the context of childhood obesity."
"9473242","ABSTRACT  In food and drug allergy, anaphylaxis, allergic rhinitis, asthma and other forms of acute and chronic allergic diseases, eosinophils and mast cells, through release of preformed and newly generated mediators, granule proteins, cytokines and other mediators are felt to be key effector cells. Eosinophils and mast cells are also implicated in other type 2 immunologic diseases including chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and atopic dermatitis. For many allergic diseases, drugs that inhibit mast cell degranulation, reduce eosinophil numbers, or counteract their released mediators are useful therapies, but all remain incompletely effective.  Siglec-6 and Siglec-8 are members of the CD33-related subfamily of sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (siglecs). Siglec-6 is found on human mast cells, some B cells and cyto- and syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta, while Siglec-8 is expressed on human eosinophils, mast cells and weakly on basophils. These transmembrane proteins contain N-terminal extracellular lectin binding domains that recognize distinct glycan ligands, and c-terminal intracellular domains including putative ITIM and ITSM signaling motifs. Both Siglec-6 (no mouse counterpart) and Siglec-8 (with Siglec-F being its closest mouse counterpart) preferentially and uniquely recognize specific glycan ligand structures. Engagement of Siglec-8/-F with antibodies or artificial ligands causes eosinophil death. Mice deficient in Siglec-F, or deficient in the airway mucin Muc5b, which carries sialoside ligands for Siglec-F, display exaggerated allergic eosinophilic pulmonary inflammation. Siglec-8 on mast cells, in contrast, does not influence cell survival, but instead functions to inhibit IgE-mediated activation. Less is known about Siglec-6, a prominently expressed human mast cell protein. Available data suggest that Siglec-6 may also function as an inhibitory receptor, and both Siglec-6 and Siglec-8 appear to possess inhibitory activity for both IgE- and non-IgE-mediated mast cell responses. The overall goal of Project 1 is to exploit specific eosinophil and mast cell Siglecs to prevent or treat immediate allergic reactions and chronic allergic inflammation. In particular, Siglec-6 and Siglec-8 provide selective targets for manipulating mast cell and/or eosinophil responses. These concepts will be explored in three specific aims using novel Siglec-6 and Siglec-8 knock-in mice and humanized mice in studies highly integrated with other projects by delineating Siglec-6 and Siglec-8 function and signaling properties in eosinophils and mast cells (Aim 1, with Project 2 and Core B), defining and exploiting Siglec-8 and its ligands for their anti-eosinophil properties in models of chronic eosinophilic inflammation (Aim 2, with Project 2), and exploiting specific ligands of Siglec-6 and Siglec-8 for their anti-mast cell and eosinophil effects (Aim 3, , with Project 2, Project 3 and Core B)."
"9546132","Although hind limb remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is cardioprotective, the mechanism is unknown. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanism of protection by remote hind-limb ischemia. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that transient ischemic episodes, away from the myocardial infarction (MI), contribute to the recovery through secretion of beneficial exosomes from skeletal muscle endocrine, improving mitochondrial metabolism, hydrogen sulfide (H2S, an anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, vasoactive gas) and mobilization of bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) to the site of injury (Figure 1). It is known that DNA hypermethylation by epigenetic modification inhibits the gene and produces homocysteine (Hcy), leading to hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) that decreases H2S. Interestingly, increase in cystathione ? synthase (CBS) and cystathionine ? lyase (CSE) enzymes increases H2S and decreases Hcy. Our preliminary data suggests that RIC induced musclin (a skeletal muscle hormone) attenuated myocardial muscle damage and dysfunction. The central hypothesis will be tested by the following three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine whether the RIC releases exosomes, induces musclin and reverses compromised skeletal and cardiac muscle function during MI and diabetes. Specific Aim 2: To determine whether the RIC enhances H2S production by increasing CBS and CSE expression, and epigenetic hypomethylation and gene induction during MI and diabetes. Specific Aim 3: To determine whether the RIC instigates BMSC mobilization to the site of myocardial injury and mitigates muscle damage by regeneration after MI during diabetes."
"9414589","A group of excitatory neurons located in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) that express the transcription factor, Phox2b, integrate sensory inputs and information regarding brain state for transmission on to respiratory rhythm/pattern-generating circuits. In addition, RTN neurons adjust their firing in response to changes in CO2 (or H+) and adjust breathing to maintain physiologically appropriate levels of pH and PCO2, a homeostatic  process called central respiratory chemoreception. Dysfunction of central chemoreception is implicated in various central disorders of breathing that often occur during sleep (e.g., sudden infant death, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS)). In the last project period, we showed that Phox2b-expressing RTN  neurons are intrinsically chemosensitive, and identified two independent molecular proton sensors in RTN  neurons - TASK-2, a proton-inhibited background K+ channel and GPR4, a proton-activated G protein-coupled receptor - that are required for stimulation of breathing by CO2. Important questions remain, however,  regarding: the ionic basis for baseline firing properties and modulation by arousal state-dependent factors; the  effector systems engaged downstream of GPR4 in RTN neurons; and mechanisms by proposed astrocytic  modulation can be integrated with the requirement for GPR4 and TASK-2 in RTN-mediated respiratory  chemosensitivity. This proposal addresses these issues using: novel conditional knockout mouse lines; viral-mediated shRNA knockdown and/or rescue; single cell electrophysiology and molecular biology; and whole animal  assays of respiratory function and vigilance states. The hypothesis underpinning Specific Aim 1 is that TTX- resistant subthreshold Na+ channels, NALCN and NaV1.9, contribute to baseline excitability of RTN neurons and mediate facilitatory effects of neuropeptides associated with arousal state-dependent brain nuclei. We  disrupt expression of these channels in RTN neurons and determine effects on subthreshold Na+ currents, basal and neuropeptide-modulated firing in vitro, and arousal state-dependent respiratory CO2 sensitivity in vivo. The hypothesis driving Specific Aim 2 is that GPR4 engages a cAMP-transduction pathway and background K+ channel (independent of TASK-2) for cellular pH sensing in RTN neurons, and that astrocytic amplification of respiratory chemoreflexes involves boosting local pH changes around RTN neurons. We use  pharmacological and transcriptomic approaches in single RTN neurons to characterize the GPR4 signaling pathway and  effector channel, and we disrupt a pH-modulating Na+ -HCO3 transporter, NBCe1, in medullary astrocytes to  determine effects on the respiratory chemoreflex in vivo. This latter may support a convergent theory for  astrocyte-neuron contributions for this highly sensitive chemoreflex, bridging a major current divide in the field.  Collectively, the proposed studies provide critical information regarding molecular and cellular mechanisms that control activity of RTN neurons, and regulate this important homeostatic respiratory system.  Identification of novel molecular mechanisms may provide new therapeutic targets for disorders of breathing."
"9555539","Project Summary  There are currently no approved vaccines for most emerging biological pathogens (Ebola, Chikungunya, MERS CoV, SARS, Zika), opportunistic infections (S. aureus, Candidiasis, adenovirus) or potential bioterrorism agents (Y. pestis, B. Pseudomallei, F. tularensis, Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae), and therapeutic interventions such as antibiotics and antivirals are only effective for a select few pathogens. A promising approach for rapidly neutralizing the risk of pathogen exposure is the use of immunomodulators capable of eliciting a robust innate immune response within hours of administration that would provide protective resistance against a wide range of biological agents. Innate immunity has evolved as a first line of defense against invading pathogens and acts through highly conserved pattern- recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) to coordinate the innate inflammatory response to both endogenous and exogenous stimuli.  The objective of this Phase I research proposal is to initiate an investigation of structure-activity relationships within a new class of chemically and metabolically more stable synthetic TLR4 agonists in order to identify the structural requirements for the development of a broad-spectrum immunomodulator that would provide non-specific protective resistance (NSR) against a wide range of biological agents. In addition to potentially providing weeks-long NSR against a wide range of viruses and bacteria, the improved stability profile of these synthetic immunomodulators should improve thermal stability leading to a longer shelf-life and avoidance of cold-chain requirements for distribution.  Aim 1 will focus on (i) the synthesis of six new TLR4 agonists in which the labile ester and phosphate groups are replaced with more stable bioisosters, and (ii) evaluation of the stability of these new agonists in aqueous formulations. Aim 2 will evaluate the biological activity of the new compounds in vitro for (i) TLR4 species-specificity and potency in a TLR4 specific reporter assay and (ii) cytokine induction from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  This phase I research proposal and subsequent phase II have the potential to develop broad- spectrum immunomodulators that would provide non-specific protective resistance (NSR) against a wide range of biological agents, and is primarily targeted for preventing upper respiratory tract infections in individuals or populations at risk for emerging or opportunistic pathogen exposure. Such treatment could help prevent deaths associated with seasonal or pandemic influenza viruses as well as other respiratory pathogens of significant medical concern."
"9627381","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous Gram-positive organism implicated in a spectrum of diseases; from benign, localized skin infections to life-threatening, systemic illnesses including pneumonia, sepsis and menstrual or non-menstrual toxic shock syndromes (TSS). The virulence and pathogenicity of S. aureus is attributed to its several exotoxins. The superantigen exotoxins (SAg) are important amongst them because SAg are the most potent activators of T lymphocytes known. Certain SAg could also be used as biological weapons. Thus, SAg are important from many perspectives. Nonetheless, the molecular pathways by which SAg participate in the disease pathogenesis have not been completely understood due to lack of good animal models. The conventional mouse strains are resistant to TSS due to poor binding of SAg to mouse MHC class II. However, SAg binds more efficiently to human MHC (called HLA) class I molecules. Therefore, mice transgenically expressing HLA class II molecules readily succumb to the pathogenic effects of SAg delivered through different routes and to S. aureus infection. As the disease caused by SAg in HLA class II (HLA-DR3) transgenic mice also closely mimics the syndrome in humans, they are ideal models. Using this mouse model we have demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-?) dependent small intestinal pathology plays a critical role in lethality associated with TSS. However, the molecular pathways by which INF-? contributes to lethality in TSS, either directly or indirectly through other mediators, are not clear. Therefore, it is proposed to (1) Delineate th mechanisms by which IFN-? plays a lethal role in staphylococcal SAg-induced TSS. This will be achieved by generating bone marrow chimeras between HLA-DR3.IFN-?R+/+ and HLA-DR3.IFN-?R-/- mice. Bone marrow chimeras will be challenged with SEB and several molecular pathways will be compared. However, IFN-? is also important for immunity S. aureus infections. Therefore, it is proposed to (2) Determine the role of IFN-? in the pathogenesis and immunity to MRSA-induced pneumonia and sepsis. This wil be accomplished by inducing pneumonia and sepsis in HLA-DR3.IFN-?+/+ and HLA-DR3.IFN-?R-/- mice with the MRSA isolate, USA300. Several bacteriological, immunological, biochemical and pathological parameters including mortality will be compared between these two lines of mice. It is known that HLA class II polymorphisms could strongly influence the magnitude of T cell activation and IFN-? production in response to streptococcal SAg. However, the impact of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ polymorphisms on staphylococcal SAg-driven immuneresponses has not been investigated. Therefore, it is proposed to (3) Determine the extent to which staphylococcal superantigen-induced IFN-? production is modulated by HLA class II polymorphisms thereby influencing the outcome of MRSA-induced pneumonia and sepsis. This will be investigated by a series of in vivo studies using transgenic mice expressing HLA-DR2, HLA-DR3, HLA-DR4, HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ6 or HLA-DQ8 molecules."
"9421207","PROJECT SUMMARY  Fibrinogen, coagulation factor VII (FVII) and factor VIII (FVIII), and its carrier protein von Willebrand factor (vWF) play key roles in modulating the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis. Similarly, D-dimer and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) reflect ongoing activation of the hemostatic system, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) is the principal inhibitor of tPA. These 7 factors reflect the primary hemostasis phenotypes that have been most commonly measured in population-based studies of healthy adults. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) successfully identified 70 loci contributing to these clinically relevant phenotypes related to thrombosis and hemostasis. The availability of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in many of the studies that contributed to these initial efforts will now allow us to expand our knowledge of the genetic variation contributing to plasma levels of these hemostasis traits. The goal of the proposed research is to utilize existing WGS-related resources in multi-ethnic studies to facilitate new genomic discovery in clinically-relevant phenotypes related to thrombosis and hemostasis.  We build upon a long-standing history of active collaboration and productivity, and have assembled the largest collection of studies with WGS data (n=37,036 individuals) and measurements for the 7 hemostasis phenotypes (fibrinogen, FVII, FVIII, vWF, D-dimer, tPa, and PAI-1). Generation of WGS data has been supported by NIH initiatives such as the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium, the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, the Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG), and others. This project provides a coordinated approach for detailed interrogation of genomic data by, (1) utilizing WGS from 10 multi-ethnic studies to assess the contribution of low frequency and rare genetic variation to 7 hemostasis phenotypes; (2) replicating significant findings in >135,000 individuals from an additional 26 studies with imputed genotypes based on TOPMed as a reference panel; and (3) integrating gene expression measurements with summary association statistics from a large- scale common variant GWAS for hemostasis traits involving all 36 studies, then using WGS to interrogate newly discovered genes. These approaches will identify genetic variation contributing to hemostasis traits that will then be evaluated for association with clinical outcomes (e.g., venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke).  This proposal brings together extensive WGS resources, hemostasis phenotypes, and capitalizes on advances in genomic technologies and computational analysis in order to contribute to the evidence base that may be used to deliver precision medicine in clinical settings."

The Core has considerably evolved since the last competitive renewal. New services provide CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 vectors, reagents and methods to identify edited genes have been added, and the number of viral vector serotypes available has been greatly expanded. These newer services are highly used, and now provide the bulk of the Core's work. Conversely, services that are less cutting-edge and are no longer frequently requested have been removed. The specific aims of the Core are to provide the following services to affiliate investigators: (1) Production of adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs), lentiviral vectors, foamy virus vectors, and gammaretroviral vectors for use in animals, tissues and cells; (2) Genome editing (editing, knock- out, knock-in) in cells and mice by CRISPR/Cas9; (3) Cost-effective production of genetically engineered mice by CRISPR/Cas9 and cryopreservation through the University of Washington Preclinical Research and Transgenic Services; (4) Screening and analysis of effects of gene editing by molecular biology techniques; and (5) Consultation and training. The Core has been highly productive in the current funding period and has added new services that are expected to significantly increase productivity and usability for Diabetes Research Center affiliate investigators to meet the Center's goal to enhance research in diabetes, obesity and related disorders in the Greater Seattle area and beyond."
"9521761","Abstract Interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment can facilitate tumor growth and progression by altering gene expression and modulating tumor cell behavior such as by enhancing growth, survival, spread or neovascularization. The transfer of bioactive molecules from one cell to another is a mechanism by which tumor cells interact with other cells within their microenvironment. Non-coding (nc) RNA molecules are capable of effecting genomic changes and can modulate gene expression. Thus, intercellular transfer of ncRNA provides a powerful mechanism by which tumor cells can epigenetically modify their environment. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which ncRNA are released within extracellular vesicles and their involvement in tumor cell-stromal cell interactions. The studies described are based on our observations of highly selective release of some ncRNA within extracellular vesicles from hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cells and their contribution to activation of cell signaling pathways in recipient cells. Using human HCC or myofibroblastic cell lines, patient-derived HCC, and primary human hepatic stellate cells, we will characterize vesicles and ncRNA that are functionally involved in inter-cellular RNA signaling. These studies will (a) identify extracellular vesicle ncRNA mediators of tumor-stromal interactions and their functional contribution to tumor growth, (b) define identifying characteristics of ncRNA-carrying vesicles and (c) evaluate ESCRT-II dependent mechanisms by which ncRNA are sorted for release within vesicles during tumor-stromal interactions. Using new approaches for the detection of RNA gene expression and inter-cellular transfer with in-vitro and in-vivo tumor-stromal cell co-culture models, these studies will define the mechanistic relationship between regulated release of extracellular vesicles, functional non-coding RNA and tumor cell- stromal cell interactions. Elucidating the essential contribution of inter-cellular RNA signaling to tumor growth will provide the basis for therapeutic strategies to target these interactions and mechanisms for the treatment or prevention of HCC."
"9473695","Project Summary/Abstract There is no validated assay to reliably detect the early onset of the Lyme disease infection at the time when antibiotic therapy has the best chance of a cure without sequelae. Diagnosis is often difficult because most symptoms are often nebulous, with the telltale ?bulls-eye? rash only appearing and clearly recognizable in approximately half of cases. The standard types of infectious diagnostic tests ? both culture and serology ? require >3 weeks for a positive result after the onset of infection with Lyme disease and serology only indicates exposure but not active infection. This introduces a significant delay in treatment. While PCR for B. burgdorferi DNA in the blood has potential for a rapid, accurate result, past tests have not had sufficient sensitivity because of too few bacteria and low copy numbers of DNA in the blood. We have developed an approach that ?enlarges the targetability?, by 160,000 fold, thereby increasing the sensitivity of PCR test for B. burgdorferi. Our data show we are successfully accomplishing this by: using a larger amount of blood to start (10 fold); then selectively multiplying the target by using Borrelia-directed primers prior to PCR (2000 fold); and then probing the product for the B. burgdorferi on a multi-loci PCR platform (8 fold). To assure reliability and acceptance of a new test based on this approach, we formally consulted with the FDA from the beginning. We obtained a Qsub (pre-IDE) approval with guidance as to what we need for a cleared test. During this proposal we will continue to test blood samples (from eventually confirmed Lyme cases and control subjects) with our PCR-based assay at the time the patient presents to the doctor in order to prove the assay can detect the B. burgdorferi infection, earlier and with greater sensitivity, than the FDA benchmark of two-tiered serology taken at the same time. If successful, at the number agreed on with the FDA, this Phase II should result in a test that has FDA clearance. Our goal is deliver a functional and affordable diagnostic assay for Early Onset Lyme Disease that has superior sensitivity and specificity compared to two-tiered serology. The test will permit immediate diagnosis well before seroconversion or cultures become positive so treatment can be started right away."
"9387128","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) including end stage renal disease (CKD stage 5) is a major health problem in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) affecting more than 50 million individuals but there is lamentable lack of research data and there is no promise of urgently needed preventative strategies. The lack of data on CKD in SSA are in part due to the absence of population-based epidemiologic studies of CKD and a scarcity of physician scientists conducting genetic, clinical and translational research on CKD according to local priorities. Herein, we propose to leverage the H3Africa Kidney Disease Research Network (H3A-KDRN) to (i) conduct genomics, clinical and translational research on the most prevalent forms of CKD; (ii) expand and support a well-trained cadre of African researchers and physician scientists to conduct CKD research according to regional priorities; (iii) engage SSA communities and research participants in the initiation, governance, implementation and dissemination of CKD research and (iv) foster collaboration with U.S.-based basic, clinical and translational researchers (including Africans in the diaspora) to elucidate etiologies and mechanisms and discover effective therapeutic and preventative strategies to combat the extraordinary burden of CKD in people of African ancestry globally The H3A-KDRN is organized as a research consortium initially composed of: (a) 15 academic medical centers/university teaching hospitals in five African countries- Cameroon - 1, Ghana ? 4, Nigeria ? 8, South Africa - 1 and Tanzania ? 1; (b) 9 North American/Israeli research intensive academic medical institutions; (c) 3 shared cores ?

"9597800","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant application responds to PA-15-169: Secondary Analyses in Obesity, Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (R21) with an exploratory/developmental application designed to determine whether a copy number variant in salivary amylase (AMY1), recently shown for the first time to be associated with body mass index (BMI), 1) associates with BMI, dietary intake, fasting insulin and glucose in European-, African- and Hispanic-Americans, and 2) predicts weight loss, weight loss maintenance, insulin resistance and/or diabetes outcomes in two large behavioral weight loss trials. Specifically, we propose to add de novo genotyping of three variants in the AMY1 region (AMY1 CNV, AMY2 CNV and a new AMY1 microsatellite), and conduct secondary data analyses leveraging existing data from two of the largest behavioral weight loss trials conducted to date. Look AHEAD (Action for Health and Diabetes) Study is a multi-center randomized controlled trial with the primary goal of determining whether weight loss achieved through an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) can improve health outcomes among persons with type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a randomized clinical trial testing whether lifestyle intervention or metformin prevents or delays type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals, provides an excellent replication cohort due to similarity in lifestyle intervention and dietary measurement. DPP further tracked insulin resistance and incidence of diabetes, providing a unique opportunity to test whether AMY1 predicts diabetes incidence over time and whether behavioral weight loss treatment may mitigate this association. Given the successful weight loss, excellent retention, large samples sizes with genetic consent (>7,000 combined) and extensive data collection in both of these studies, they provide outstanding opportunities to cost-effectively explore the role of the AMY1 region in BMI and diet as well as treatment outcomes related to weight loss, weight loss maintenance, and incidence of type 2 diabetes. Overall, this proposal will expand the breadth of knowledge regarding the phenotypes predicted by AMY1 and test for the first time potential treatment implications, beginning to lay the groundwork for optimizing obesity treatment and diabetes prevention based on AMY1 copy number."
"9416967","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of this project is to characterize how intratumoral heterogeneity is influenced by tumor suppressive mechanisms. Specifically, the consequence of p53 loss on the development and maintenance of cell-cell genetic diversity will be investigated, based on preliminary data from mouse models. Intratumoral heterogeneity produces a substrate for evolutionary selection and adaptation to a changing environment, for example, as cells disseminate to a new site or are challenged by therapeutic intervention (13). Acquired resistance to therapy is a major roadblock in achieving durable cures for B-cell lymphomas and other cancers (4). In many contexts, resistance has been shown to originate from pre-existing drug-resistant subclones (19, 20), and thus, the level of genetic variation in the tumor underlies the robustness of the tumor to clinical intervention. Central Hypothesis: As genetic abnormalities occur, they have a greater probability of persisting in the population, as a lack of p53 levels the playing field by reducing the differences in relatve fitness between a broader array of otherwise nonviable genotypes. The inevitable result is the accumulation of intratumoral heterogeneity. Specific aims: 1) Intratumoral genetic diversity of a collection of human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) will be measured using a single cell sequencing approach (29). The association of heterogeneity and p53 status will be investigated. 2) The role of p53 in the development of heterogeneous lymphomas will be functionally evaluated in a mouse model of B-cell lymphoma. 3) The mechanism of intratumoral heterogeneity will be explored by lineage tracing and by inactivating various p53-related sensors and effectors to determine if modification of a variety of p53-realted processes, including the DNA-damage response, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and lineage commitment, can recapitulate the diversity phenotype achieved with the loss of p53. Training Plan: The applicant will rely on an interdisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators to develop an expertise in cell & molecular biology, mouse genetics, and computational analysis of genomic data. Sufficient oncology clinical exposure will be pursued to optimize the relevance of laboratory investigations and to obtain the skills necessary for cultivating future clinical and translational partnerships. Implications/Relevance: This fellowship will effectively realize the goals of the NIH by fostering creative and innovative research regarding the cause and cure of human disease (i.e. treatment failure), and by developing the applicant to contribute over the long term to the Nation's capability to prevent disease and economic well-being through biomedical innovation."
"9616361","PROJECT SUMMARY  Angioedema (AE) is a rare clinical symptom reported to affect at least 200,000 people in the US and approximately 1 in 30-50,000 persons worldwide. It is readily recognized as a usually asymmetrical, non- erythematous, non-pruritic, non-pitting, localized, transient, episodic swelling of a soft body area involving lax skin, oropharyngolaryngeal tissue and/or gastrointestinal wall. Chronically recurrent angioedema causes significant personal, domestic, social, and occupational disability and exposes patients to the risk of death due to suffocation. Angioedema includes: hereditary angioedema (HAE), which is attributed to complete genetic deficiency or functionally disruptive mutations in the C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) gene (located on chromosome 11q12-q13); drug-induced AE? which today is the fastest growing group of patients?which occurs in a segment of population under treatment with ACE-inhibitors; and idiopathic AE, which is of unknown origin. C1-INH is the major regulator of the key enzymes involved in both the complement and kinin/kallikrein (KKS) systems. Therefore its physical or functional absence leads to uncontrolled activation of both systems resulting in the overproduction by the KKS of a potent vasoactive peptide, bradykinin (BK)?the major mediator of the swelling. Although several therapeutic interventions for short-term or long-term treatments are available?including C1- INH replacement therapy?each treatment presents itself with major or minor deleterious side effects. More importantly, the current therapeutic agents only target downstream events long after the KKS has been triggered. Therefore, new therapeutic modalities that address these concerns and target upstream events are a much-needed and unmet challenge. The receptor for the globular heads of C1q, gC1qR, is the major zinc- dependent high affinity receptor for both high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and FXII, and plays a central role in the assembly and activation of the KKS. Blockade of gC1qR with mAb 74.5.2, which inhibits HK binding to endothelial cells, also prevents kinin generation and vascular permeability in vivo (US patent recently awarded). The proposed studies are therefore designed to accomplish three goals. First, to solve the crystal structures of gC1qR: (i) in complex with HK and/or HKH20; and with mAb 74.5.2, (ii) then, using an vitro model of vascular permeability, to asses the presence and the activity of the permeabilizing factor(s) in plasma samples obtained from various AE patients, and (iii) to examine the therapeutic potential of not only mAbs but also small peptide inhibitors (linear or cyclic)?identified from the structure-function studies and pre-screened in Aim II? in a mouse model of intravital microscopy. The results from these studies, in turn, will not only elucidate the structural, physiological, and molecular correlates involved in the induction or enhancement of vascular permeability during the attack phase of angioedema, but in the long term, full understanding of the role of gC1qR in the pathophysiology of this syndrome will provide a sound rationale for the design of novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of hereditary or ACE-induced AE."
"9631599","PROJECT SUMMARY  The lung is a richly innervated organ. Strong evidence, including recent findings from us, demonstrates that neuronal control plays central roles in basic lung response to the environment, including immune activity, as well as airway and vascular smooth muscle tone which impacts air conductance and pulmonary blood pressure, respectively. However, the full extent of how the nervous system affects lung function remains unclear, and little is known of the anatomical and molecular features of the neurons that innervate the lung. Here, we propose to use cutting-edge viral-based circuit tracing, single cell transcriptomic and haploid ES cell- based genome editing technologies to: 1) label lung-innervating neurons; 2) determine their localization and projection pattern; 3) generate knockin mouse lines that will lay the foundation for neuromodulation of lung function. Findings generated in mice will be tested in human biopsy samples to delineate conserved versus species-specific mechanisms. With the development of wireless, implantable devices, neuromodulatory therapy is on the horizon. Findings from this study will lay the necessary foundation for precise manipulation of organ function through the nervous system, and thus closely comply with the mission of the SPARC program."
"9442884","ABSTRACT:  The rapid drug sensitivity assessment from a panel of drugs within the tumor environment can realize the potential of individualized medicine in oncology. Our current work includes numerous collaborations that illustrate how the technology will be used in the future. We identified three areas i) in vivo use in a clinical setting, ii) ex vivo use in a clinical setting, iii) preclinical use to relate molecular phenotype of cancer to drug response. The focus of this R33 proposal is to address the major feasibility gaps that we identified for these uses. The gaps are identified in the following aims:  Aim 1: Increasing the yield of sample collection in a surgical setting. Clinical users achieved very low successful sample recovery in our early experiments compared with our trained technical staff in a preclinical environment. This aim will develop technology to achieve high sample yield with comparatively less skilled operators.   Aim 2: Increasing the rate at which individual devices can be loaded with many chemotherapeutic agents. Many important preclinical experiments require numbers of devices that exceed that which that can be prepared using our current method. Reservoir filling currently takes between 30 and 45 minutes for each device. This aim will reduce the time required to of the order of one minute with higher reliability.  Aim 3: Decreasing the time required to analyze the large number of histology slides that result from any one experiment. Microdosing using our device dramatically increases the number of histological sections that must be interpreted. Secondly, unprecedented spatial precision and accuracy are required to collocate the section with individual reservoirs on the device. This aim will ensure the spatial accuracy and not sacrifice the rate at which samples can be processed.   Our innovations center on addressing each of these gaps. Specifically, we have designed and prototyped and specialized biopsy instrument that will retrieve the device and surrounding tissue while being operated by a surgeon. Secondly, we have designed a dispensing device that can fill devices with 18 different drugs at high rates with the required accuracy and is capable of producing dozens such devices in a lot. Finally, we have prototyped a system to that can make precision specimens for histology and the resulting slides can be analyzed at high rates.  "
"9561463","Project Summary The microbiome and the metabolome are intricately linked with host immunity and are emerging as critical regulators of vaccine-induced immune responses. Despite their importance, we lack a fundamental understanding of their influence ? both positive and negative on HIV vaccine outcomes. Bridging this gap will complement the significant efforts directed at immunogen/adjuvant design and advance the development of an HIV vaccine that is both effective and safe. The main objective of this R03 is to delineate the role of the microbiome and metabolome in accumulation of HIV target CD4 T cells in the female genital tract (FGT) in order to understand their role in subverting vaccine efficacy. These studies will be conducted under the auspices of a parent K01-funded vaccine study evaluating immunogencity and efficacy of a DNA-Prime/Protein boost vaccine platform in rhesus macaques. In Aim 1 of this research project, we will test the hypothesis that recruitment of HIV target CD4 T cells to the lower FGT over the course of vaccination is dictated by specific vaginal bacterial communities. In Aim 2, we will determine whether distinct metabolite profiles are strongly associated with the frequency and phenotype of HIV target cells in the FGT. The ultimate goal of this R03 proposal is to determine whether a cervicovaginal microbial/metabolite composition that predisposes to vaccine induced infiltration of HIV target CD4 T cells to the FGT results in vaccine failure. By integrating cutting-edge microbiome and metabolome analysis into scheduled collection of samples alongside a comprehensive evaluation of immune responses and vaccine efficacy, the R03 will leverage existing resources to not only break new ground and open avenues for further exploration but also better inform vaccine outcomes of the parent study. The findings will provide critical preliminary data for an R01 proposal to elucidate the mechanisms by which microbiota influence HIV vaccine outcomes. The strong environment of the CNPRC and CCM, robust genomic, metabolomic, bioinformatics, and statistical support provided by UC Davis Genome Center, the strong and complementary expertise of the collaborators combined with the PIs expertise in T cell immunology, preclinical vaccine studies, micobiota analysis, and metabolism will facilitate the successful execution of the proposed studies within the 2-year timeline."
"9449653","PROJECT SUMMARY Small Animal Radiation Research (SARR) is of paramount importance for the advancement of human radiotherapy (RT) by serving as a critical counterpart to perform comprehensive preclinical studies on a large number of subjects under controlled experimental conditions at low costs. SARR relies on dedicated platforms to administer radiation dose to animals in a similar way as in the clinic. Current-generation SARR irradiators, developed in the past decade, have failed to keep pace with technology advancements in human RT. In stark contrast to modern RT treatments where novel anatomical and functional imaging, inverse treatment planning, and intensity modulated delivery techniques are routinely employed to precisely form an extremely conformal dose distribution to the tumor, the therapeutic form in current SARR systems resembles an obsolete form of human RT. This technology disparity has substantially impaired SARR study relevance to human RT, impeded explorations in RT research, and hindered rapid conduction of SARR studies. Towards addressing this problem, in response to PAR-15-075, this project will develop and translate a next-generation SARR platform through an academic-industrial partnership, joining medical physicists and radiobiologists at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) with engineering experts at Faxitron Bioptics LLC (Faxitron). The developed system will be substantially superior to the current state-of-the-art SARR platform due to its novel imaging methods (dual energy cone beam CT and PET), intensity modulated radiotherapy, and high computation and treatment delivery efficiency. These novel features are expected to improve SARR research relevance to human RT by delivering treatments of clinical quality, to support exploration in modern RT by offering technical freedom to realize novel imaging and therapy approaches, and to increase research efficiency by enhancing computational speed and workflow. We will perform studies with the following specific aims (SAs): SA1: Refine hardware design and construct the hardware system including mechanical, imaging, and therapy subsystems. SA2: Refine software design and develop an imaging and treatment planning system accompanied with the hardware platform. SA3: Perform comprehensive system tests, develop a translation plan, and demonstrate achieved advantages of the system via an animal study on image-guided intensity-modulated lung stereotactic body radiotherapy using rats. The innovation of this project includes novel technological capabilities enabled by the next-generation SARR platform, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end- users. Project feasibility is ensured by extensive preliminary studies, and the research team integrating medical physicists and radiobiologists (UTSW) with strong clinical and research expertise and engineers (Faxitron) with extensive commercial product development experience. By filling the critical void between SARR and human RT, the developed system will become an essential component in preclinical research for the exploration of novel radiotherapeutic strategies with high relevance to human RT."
"9413985","Project Summary/Abstract Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes major organ damage and shortens lifespan in relatively young persons. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to improving outcomes for SLE patients. However, evidenced-based approaches to early treatment interventions and the appropriate target population for these interventions are not available. We propose that individuals who have positivity for antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and who also exhibit some of the other features that are used to classify SLE, are at high risk of progressing to the full systemic form of this disease. These individuals, who have significant levels of ANA with 1 or 2 additional items from the lupus classification criteria, are considered to have incomplete lupus erythematosus or ILE. We propose to treat ILE patients with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the ?Study of Anti- Malarials in Incomplete Lupus Erythematosus? or SMILE trial. The primary objective is to determine whether HCQ treatment can prevent acquisition of additional clinical and immunologic features that define SLE. The major secondary objectives are to determine whether HCQ treatment: (1) lessens lupus disease activity as measured by standard scoring indices; (2) improves patient reported outcomes (3) prevents accumulation of immunologic abnormalities including autoantibodies and cytokines and (4) has an acceptable toxicity profile. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To carry out a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized trial of HCQ vs. placebo in patients with ILE. The study tests the hypothesis that early use of HCQ can modify disease features so that accumulation of abnormalities leading to a classification of SLE can be significantly slowed. 2. To determine effects of HCQ on disease activity and patient-reported outcomes in patients with ILE. 3. To characterize the immunologic profile of HCQ in ILE-treated patients. Autoantibodies, cytokines and chemokines will be measured on multiplex arrays for developing insights into underlying mechanisms. 4. To quantitatively assess the incidence of ophthalmologic toxicity in HCQ-treated ILE patients. All enrolled patients will have standardized ophthalmologic examinations before and after study treatment. Recommendations for use and monitoring in this patient population will be developed. The SMILE trial will determine whether or not HCQ should be given to ILE patients, will provide insights into the appropriate target population, and will propose candidate biomarkers to guide treatment decisions. While not part of the Precision Medicine Initiative®, SMILE is consistent with its goals. It will be the first step towards testing the feasibility of disease prevention studies in SLE and will accumulate biological samples in a repository that will be available to the lupus research community for further in-depth mechanistic studies."

This IPCAVD team has immunogens that can trigger unmutated common ancestors (UCAs) of bnAb B cell lineages, a key approach for an HIV vaccine. One such sequential Env immunogen termed, EnvSeq-3, is derived from the study of the CH848 HIV-1-infected individual who made the DH270 HIV V3-glycan-targeted bnAb. We hypothesize that use of priming immunogens that bind to the UCA of the DH270 B cell lineage followed by sequential modified mRNA gp160 or gp140 trimer-based immunogens will result in the initiation of V3-glycan bnAb B cell lineages in humans.  ? Specific Aim 1. Design and formulate sequential nucleoside-modified mRNAs encoding two  gp160s or soluble chimeric, stabilized trimers that bind to intermediate antibodies of the DH270  B cell lineage. Nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding the first 2 trimeric lineage immunogens after the  V3-glycopeptide will be optimized for high level expression using established techniques.  ? Specific Aim 2. Determine if synthetic UCA-binding glycopeptides combined with GLA/SE  adjuvant will prime DH270 UCA B cells for boosting with Env trimer-encoding mRNAs in DH270  UCA VH and VL knock-in mice. Glycopeptide and mRNA immunogens will be analyzed including  combinations to confirm in DH270 UCA VH + VL knock-in (KI) mice their induction of Tfh cells and  selection of antibodies that target the V3-glycan bnAb site. The two selected mRNAs will be produced  CGMP in Project 2.  ? Specific Aim 3. Test sequential immunogens in outbred rhesus macaques to optimize  immunization schemes for use in a phase I clinical trial in year 5. We believe that modified mRNA-LNPs encoding V3-glycan lineage immunogens will generate potent CD4+ Tfh and antibody responses, and will initiate V3-glycan bnAb lineages in bnAb KI mice and in humans. This project will use a promising sequential immunogen design in the form of nucleoside-modified mRNAs to overcome barriers to bnAb development. If successful, the use of nucleoside-modified mRNAs will transform HIV-1 vaccine development."
"9543100","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most prevalent birth defects, affecting up to 1% of live births. While a genetic etiology is indicated by the finding of various syndromic forms of CHD, the genetic causes of CHD is still not well understood. As the genetic variability of the human population confounds human genetic analysis, we recently pursued a large scale ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen in inbred C57BL6 mice to recover recessive mutations causing CHD. Phenotyping was conducted using noninvasive fetal echocardiography, an imaging modality used clinically for CHD diagnosis. From ultrasound scanning 100,000 fetuses, we recovered >250 CHD mutant mouse lines with a wide spectrum of CHD. We recovered 150 CHD causing mutations in 94 genes using whole exome sequencing analysis. Surprisingly, 50% of the CHD genes are cilia related, indicating a central role for cilia in CHD pathogenesis. Also unexpected was the recovery of many cilia related CHD genes encoding proteins known to physically interact, suggesting the hypothesis that CHD pathogenesis may occur via epistasis in the context of a CHD interactome network. This could contribute to the complex genetics associated with human CHD. To test this hypothesis, we plan to conduct a novel sensitized screen for the first systematic interrogation of the mouse genome for semi-dominant CHD mutations. The screen will be conducted using a driver mutation in Cep290, a cilia-CHD gene recovered in our recessive screen that is also clinically well described to exert genetic modifier effects, both in various human ciliopathies and in mutant mouse models. Our screen will entail ultrasound scanning G2 fetuses for CHD derived from females heterozygous for the Cep290 mutation mated to a G1 male heterozygous for ENU induced mutations. The resulting G2 offspring can only be double heterozygous for the Cep290 and ENU induced mutations (except when the ENU mutation is also in Cep290). Thus any CHD observed would reflect the effects of epistasis. Using this strategy, we expect to screen ~54,000 fetuses from 1800 G1 pedigrees, providing a systems approach to interrogate the role of cilia in the complex genetics of CHD not possible with a recessive screen. Mutation recovery will be carried out using whole mouse exome sequencing followed by genotyping analysis, and further linkage analysis conducted within and across multiple pedigrees. For validation of causal mutations identified in the screen, transgenic mouse models will be generated using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, followed by intercrosses with the Cep290 mutation to examine for evidence of epistasis. Overall, this novel sensitized screen will provide the first systematic interrogation of the mouse genome for semi-dominant mutations causing CHD. By using mutation in Cep290 as driver for this sensitized screen, we can further elucidate role of cilia in CHD pathogenesis. The mutations and animal models recovered in this sensitized screen will better model the complex genetics of human CHD and better inform future clinical studies interrogating the genetics etiology of CHD in the human population."
"9472721","PROJECT SUMMARY Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent sensory deficits that affect one in five individuals in the United States. While the underlying etiology can vary widely, viral infections are speculated to be associated with hearing loss with a sudden onset. Lassa fever (LF), caused by Lassa virus (LASV), is a major public health threat in West Africa and is characterized by acute hemorrhagic disease and/or neurological sequelae, and up to 500,000 cases are reported annually. Approximately 30% of LF survivors develop sudden onset hearing loss weeks or months after leaving the hospital, placing a huge burden on the public health system and impacting patients' quality of life. This phenomenon is quite unique because it typically develops at later stages of the disease process, thus making LF the only viral infection described in medical literature that induces hearing loss mostly in the convalescence phase. Until now, the lack of a robust animal model exhibiting sudden onset hearing loss induced by LASV prevented the mechanistic study of this clinical feature. To address this need, we developed a novel murine model for LF that mimics many symptoms of human LF. Most importantly, our model consistently reproduced the hearing loss in animals that were recovering from infection. This powerful tool will allow us, for the first time, to study the pathogenesis of hearing loss associated with LF, in a maximum containment BSL-4 setting. The long-term goal of our research is to identify the immunological and pathological mechanisms responsible for LASV-induced hearing loss in human patients to enable future treatment. The objective of this application is to use our physiologically relevant LF mouse model to study the mechanism of LF associated hearing loss, as well as to assess auditory damage of LF survivors in West Africa. Therefore, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine the mechanism of hearing loss in LASV-infected Stat1-/- mice. We will investigate the underlying mechanism by focusing on the inner ear, as well as determining the involvement of the central nervous system in hearing loss, by studying the auditory behavior of infected mice in order to define the localization of the injury and assess histopathological changes in the inner ear. 2. Identify the role of T cells in the development of hearing loss by performing loss/gain of function experiments. We will utilize T cell depletion and adoptive transfer techniques to determine the contribution of T cells to hearing loss in infected Stat1-/- mice. We will also identify the viral antigen most essential for T cell recruitment to the auditory nerve. 3. Determine the degree of hearing loss and location of functional damage in human patients exhibiting SHL after surviving LASV infection. We propose to investigate the underlying the hearing loss in documented LF survivors in Nigeria by using noninvasive diagnostic tests routinely performed during newborn hearing screening in the USA."
"9559818","ABSTRACT Reducing HIV incidence requires a ?precision public health? approach encompassing prevention campaigns, targeted interventions, and ?next-generation? surveillance through multimodal instruments, including sequencing. Molecular epidemiology methods (phylogenetics and phylodynamics) have recently gained traction for use in identifying and tracking epidemic transmission clusters, as well as reconstructing the demographic history of viral pathogen populations. However, such methods are not equipped to identify both transmission clusters and their corresponding dynamics in real time, and transmission clusters are assumed to be unrealistically static over the course of the epidemic. Consequently, scientists, and/or clinicians, cannot distinguish between growth or decline of a sub-epidemic nor determine the sources ?local or external? driving regional epidemic incidence. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a novel theoretical and technical framework able to model dynamically HIV transmission clusters over time by analyzing large, longitudinal sequence data. Our new tool for dynamic identification of transmission epicenters (HIV-DYNAMITE) will aid in monitoring, in real time, hyper-connected and/or long-lasting clusters fueling emerging HIV regional epidemics. As an application study, we will focus on the ongoing HIV epidemic in Florida. Florida has the highest incidence of HIV in the United States (US) due to a unique set of circumstances fostering an ongoing statewide epidemic. HIV infections are rising amongst men who have sex with men, minority, and immigrant/tourist populations. Risk assessment of the epidemic thus needs to be contextualized, taking into account both local determinants as well as inflow from other states and/or countries. In collaboration with the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), we seek to identify and predict infection trends as well as virus spread within Florida and among neighboring destinations by applying HIV-DYNAMITE to the extensive FDOH viral sequence dataset (>44,300 sequences) collected over the past 10 years coupled with geo-demographic information. We will validate the system using newly obtained longitudinal data and design intervention strategies through focus groups with the FDOH and other stakeholders. We aim to both complement and enhance existing efforts, such as the CDC?s HIV-TRACE, which is currently based on sequence data only, which also lacks dynamic or geographic spread components. The interdisciplinary expertise of the team renders this project feasible, and the proposed approach has the potential to be incorporated into other settings within the US with comparable statewide surveillance and virus sequencing coverage through national reference centers."
"9473239","OVERALL ABSTRACT  Mast cells and eosinophils are essential effector cells in both acute and chronic allergic inflammatory responses. The overall goal of this Program is to exploit eosinophil and mast cell Siglecs (sialic acid binding, immunoglobulin-like lectins) to prevent or treat immediate allergic reactions and chronic allergic inflammation. The overarching hypothesis is that specific mAbs, endogenous tissue glycans, or synthetic ligand analogs, can specifically and selectively engage complementary glycan binding Siglecs (CD33, Siglec-6, and Siglec-8) on eosinophils and/or mast cells to prevent or limit IgE-dependent and IgE-independent eosinophil and mast cell- related allergic responses.  This application focuses on the role of three mast cell and eosinophil Siglecs that we hypothesize provide ideal targets for dampening allergic effector cell responses in a variety of acute and chronic allergy-related disorders. Dr. Bruce Bochner will serve as the PI of Project 1 (Defining Siglec-6 and Siglec-8 function on effector cells of allergic diseases as well as Core A (Administration) and Core B (Human mast cell and tissue acquisition core). Dr. James Paulson will serve as the PI of Project 2 (Siglec-targeted nanoparticles for treating mast cell mediated allergic disease) while Dr. Ronald Schnaar will serve as the PI of Project 3 (Human siglec ligands control mast cell and eosinophil mediated inflammation). This is a Program team with a proven track record of productivity and synergy.  This application includes projects that examine Siglec/eosinophil/mast cell pathways from various perspectives including pharmacology, biochemistry, cell signaling, glycobiology, and cellular and molecular biology, using in vitro experimentation and in vivo humanized models. The majority of the proposed research utilizes human material including primary human cells and biologic samples, along with animal models involving humanized mast cell mice and novel knock-in strains of mice expressing human Siglecs of interest to provide more in-depth hypothesis testing on mechanisms and outcomes that cannot yet be assessed with human research. Each Project provides numerous elements of novelty ranging from human Siglec knock-in mice to development of unique reagents for targeting specific Siglecs to discovery of endogenous human tissue ligands for specific Siglecs."
"9416109","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."
"9607817","Invasive fungal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality for people with compromised immunity. Unfortunately, the mortality associated with invasive fungal infections remains unacceptably high. One of the contributing factors to this poor outcome is the fact that there are relatively few therapeutic options for the treatment of invasive fungal infections, particularly when compared to the number of antibiotics available for the treatment of bacterial infections. To identify new antifungal drug candidates, we have initiated a high throughput screening and chemical biology-based project to identify molecules that interfere with fungal cell wall biosynthesis. Application of this strategy has rapidly led to the identification of human phosphoinositide dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) inhibitors as highly active antifungal molecules in vitro. PDK1 inhibitors have been extensively developed as targeted anticancer molecules because of their low toxicity toward normal cells. Encouragingly, two of the PDK1 inhibitors identified in our preliminary work (UCN-01 and OSU-03012) have been, or are being, evaluated in human clinical trials. In order to develop the promising potential of PDK1/Pkh inhibitors as antifungal drugs, we will: characterize the molecular basis for the activity of mammalian PDK1 inhibitors toward fungal PDK1 orthologs (Aim 1); characterize the function of PDK1 orthologs in the human fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans (Aim 2); determine in vivo efficacy of PDK1 inhibitors in animal models (Aim 3); and optimize antifungal properties of PDK1 inhibitors and identify antifungal PDK1 inhibitors with novel chemical scaffolds (Aim 4). Successful execution of these aims is expected to not only provide a fundamental chemical and biological foundation for the development of antifungal PDK1 molecules but could also lead to the rapid translation of PDK1 inhibitors to clinical use since two of our lead compounds have already been evaluated in human clinical trials."
"9415030","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SATB2 is a homobox transcription factor first discovered in 2003 that binds to AT rich sequences and likely binds chromatin modifying enzymes such as histone acetyltranferases and deacetylases for the regulation of gene expression. A number of recent papers have described SATB2 overexpression in a variety of cancers and have emphasized the importance of this overexpressed gene in driving tumorigenesis. We have studied the malignant transformation of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS2B) by carcinogenic metals such as nickel (Ni), hexavalent chromium (Cr+6), arsenic (As) and vanadate (V). While each of these metals has its own unique signature of gene expression when they transform BEAS2B cells, the signature is vastly different from metal to metal. However, SATB2 is increased in every transformed clone by any one of these metals. SATB2 is not expressed in parental BEAS2B cells. Further studies have shown that SATB2 mRNA and protein are induced in BEAS2B cells by chronic Ni ion treatment. We hypothesize that SATB2 is a transcription factor needed for normal mammalian development but its inappropriate expression during chronic Ni exposure is a driver of cell transformation. We want to investigate the mechanisms and consequences of its overexpression in BEAS2B and 16HB cells exposed to and transformed by Ni. We will overexpress SATB2 in normal BEAS-2B and 16HBE cells and investigate the effect this has on the cell's transformed properties and study the expression of other genes in these cells using gene chips. SATB2 overexpression and resulting cell transformation will also be studied in the presence of nickel exposure. We will lower the levels of SATB2 by transient knockdown with siRNA and stable knockdown with small hairpin RNA in nickel transformed BEAS2B and 16HBE cells and study the consequences of SATB2 loss on their transformed properties and investigate the effect this knockdown has on the expression of other genes using gene chips in the nickel transformed cells. We will study the mechanism of SATB2 overexpression focusing on its promoter, enhancer, upstream regulators and miRNA that target SATB2 following chronic nickel treatment of BEAS2B and 16HBE cells and in nickel transformed cells. In addition, SATB2 overexpressed in BEAS2B and 16HBE cells and in Ni-transformed cells will be immunoprecipitated, and interacting protein partners will be identified by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. To address whether nickel is able to induce SATB2 expression in vivo, we will expose A/J mice to various doses of nickel by inhalation or ingestion, and analyze SATB2 expression in several target tissues. To explore the role of SATB2 in nickel-induced tumorigenesis, we will analyze the levels of SATB2 expression in rat lung tumors induced by nickel subsulfide exposure (obtained from National Toxicology Program archive)."

"9536240","Project Summary:  Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome resulting from loss of function mutations in the Nf2 gene locus, which codes for the protein, Merlin (Moesin-Ezrin- Radixin-Like Protein). Patients with NF2 suffer almost invariably from bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) and have a high propensity for sensorineural hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, and the development of meningiomas and ependymomas. Surgical resection is currently frontline therapy for the treatment of VS and the necessity for surgical margins can further compromise auditory, vestibular, and facial nerve function.  Merlin has an actin binding domain and localizes to the cortical membrane in the cell where it is believed to function as a negative regulator of cell growth during contact inhibition. In order to develop a better understanding of how loss of Merlin contributes to schwannoma genesis, the lab generated a murine model of NF2 in which Nf2flox/flox mice have been crossed with mice which express Cre recombinase driven by a 3.9kb fragment of the periostin (Postn) promoter. These Nf2f/f;Postn-Cre mice develop a clinical pathology similar to human NF2 patients with fully penetrant peripheral, vestibular, and dermal schwannomas along with sensorineural hearing loss.  We hypothesize that loss of Merlin drives oncogenic transformation of Schwann cells through up- regulation of the NF-?B pathway. In Aim 1, we will develop new tools to elucidate NF-kB signaling in our NF2 mouse model. By modulating the signaling of a specific NF-?B protein, we will attempt to prevent pathogenic schwannoma formation in our Merlin conditionally deficient animals and assess how tumor growth alters the sensorineural hearing loss. In Aim 2, we seek to modulate a therapeutically targetable protein as a way of ameliorating a particular disease process we have observed in the inner ear of our mice and that we hypothesize is primary driver of hearing loss in our mice. The studies in Aim 1 and 2 are designed to challenge the prevailing opinion about the pathophysiology driving sensorineural hearing loss in NF2. This proposal will lead to a better understanding of Merlin signaling and provide a data driven approach to how to think about and treat sensorineural hearing loss in NF2."
"9419766","Insulin resistance is an important risk factor for alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Vice versa, heavy alcohol  consumption induces insulin resistance that is associated with progression of hepatic fibrosis in  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Insulin is the key hormone that regulates lipid and glucose  metabolism; it is also an important regulator of inflammation. Thus, hepatic insulin action is likely a key  player in the pathogenesis of ALD, yet the mechanisms through which impaired insulin action predisposes  to ALD remain poorly understood. We and others have previously demonstrated that insulin signaling within  the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) controls hepatic glucose production (hGP), very low density  lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis and innate immunity through the  autonomic nervous system. Based on our pilot data that demonstrate that in a rat model for binge drinking,  i.e. short term alcohol consumption impairs glucose tolerance and induces insulin resistance that is due to  impaired hepatic insulin action. Binge drinking markedly impairs hypothalamic insulin action, defined as the  ability of hypothalamic insulin to suppress hGP and adipose tissue lipolysis. Thus, the major hypothesis  proposed in this proposal is that some of the metabolic and innate immunity defects induced by alcohol are  caused through brain effects disrupting autonomic control of both metabolism and innate immunity. In  support ofthis novel paradigm we find that a central cause ofthe impaired hypothalamic insulin action is  decreased insulin signaling in the hypothalamus likely due to increased inflammation, ER stress and   expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase l b (PTPIb), a negative regulator of insulin signaling. Here we  propose to delineate the mechanisms through which chronic alcohol consumption impairs insulin action,  disrupts hepatic carbohydrate, amino acid and lipid metabolism and generates a pro-inflammatory  environment within the liver that predisposes to ALD."
"9537762","Summary  Endothelial cells play a critical role in multiple aspects of lung development and homeostasis, yet the precise mechanisms that regulate vasculogenesis and how endothelial cells signal to other cell types to orchestrate lung development have not been well defined. Accurate regulation of these processes is critical to ensure proper lung development and prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a lung disease of premature infants that often results in life-long complications. Hallmarks of BPD are impaired vasculature and arrested lung development. We created three-dimensional (3D) co-culture systems in which lung endothelial cells (LuMECs) drive the putative lung stem cells, BASCs, to produce bronchiolar or alveolar organoids. These organoid cultures provide an opportunity to model interactions that occur between endothelial cells and alveolar cells during lung development. Using this system, we discovered a novel BMP4-NFATc1- Thrombospondin (TSP1) pathway in endothelial and epithelial cells in the adult lung. We showed that TSP1, known as an anti-angiogenic factor, is required for the development of alveolar organoids. We also identified R-spondin2 (Rspo2), which regulates Wnt signaling in other systems, as a BMP4-regulated protein that may be downstream of TSP1 in endothelial cells. The mechanisms underlying TSP1 regulation of lung vascular development and alveolarization are unknown. We hypothesize that endothelial-derived TSP1 induced by BMP4-NFATc1 signaling inhibits pulmonary vascular development and is required for proper lung development. Further, we posit that vascular lung injury, such as that seen with hyperoxia exposure, impairs TSP1 signaling, thereby altering vasculogensis and blocking alveolar development. In Aim 1, we will determine how TSP1- CD47 interactions regulate vasculogenesis and lung development. Defective lung endothelial cells from mice exposed to hyperoxia will be used in lung organoid co-cultures to test the impact of impaired endothelial cell signals on alveolarization. Similarly, cells from knockout mice will be used in neonatal lung organoid cultures to determine the effect of CD47 deficiency on alveolar development. CD47-knockout mice and endothelial- specific TSP1-knockout mice will be used to test the role of TSP1-CD47 interactions in the response to neonatal hyperoxia-mediated lung vascular injury in vivo. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms by which TSP1-dependent Rspo2 mediates pulmonary vascular development by evaluating ligand response in vitro and after neonatal hyperoxic injury in vivo. Recombinant Rspo2 will be used in neonatal lung organoid cultures and in assays for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. We will determine if lung endothelial cell secreted factors, and more specifically, Rspo2, is sufficient for prevention of neonatal hyperoxia-mediated lung injury. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which lung endothelial cells drive critical outcomes in development. This work will determine if defective TSP1-dependent signaling is a mechanism of interrupted lung development in premature infants with BPD, leading to new ways to direct therapy for BPD."
"9628062","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The spirochete Treponema denticola (Td) is strongly associated with severe and refractory periodontal conditions. As a member of the 'red-complex' bacteria, Td primarily lives on the apical surface of subgingival plaque in direct contact with the epithelium. Thus Td is at the forefront that directly encounters enormous host immune attacks, e.g., complement killing and phagocytosis. In the pocket, polymorphoneclear leukocytes (PMNs) are the major immune cells that protect the host by killing pathogens via phagocytosis. In addition, the gingival crevice fluid (GCF), which is mainly composed of serum, contains the complement system, a critical component in host defense. Previous reports suggest that Td is resistant to the complement killing, and is able to modulate PMNs and can thrive in the oral flora. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. The central hypothesis of this application is that TDE0362 (Tmac), a new virulence factor of Td, has dual functions: its C-terminus (C362) is a protease that cleaves immune factors that are essential for the activation of PMNs and the complement killing; its N-terminus (N362) contains a bacterial immunoglobulin (Big)-like domain which blocks PMN activation via a molecular mimicry mechanism. Collectively, Tmac protects Td from the phagocytosis and the complement killing, and consequently enhances its survival and establishment of infection. To test this hypothesis, this application wil focus on the following Specific Aims: (1) To determine if Tmac is cleaved and secreted, and the mechanism involved in the cleavage; (2) To study the endopeptidase activity of Tmac on human IgG; (3) To elucidate the role of Tmac in PMN activation and its mechanism involved; and (4) To investigate the role of Tmac in the pathogenicity of Td in vitro and in vivo. Completion of this project will advance our current understanding of the pathogenicity of Td, in particular, the mechanisms involved in the innate immune evasion, which could potentially lead to new therapeutic interventions against periodontal diseases."
"9561628","ABSTRACT Heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 remains the dominant mechanism by which the epidemic is sustained worldwide and increasingly is the route by which the virus is spreading within the US. It is now well established that in a majority of transmissions, infection is initiated by a single genetic variant, the transmitted founder (TF) virus, from the transmitting partner quasispecies. This severe severe genetic bottleneck, in which one or a limited number of variants from the diverse population present in the transmitting (donor) partner establish productive infection in the previously uninfected partner is the result of both stochastic and selective processes. Although we and others have shown that selection for less evolved (more ancestral) variants present in the donor?s viral quasispecies are favored during selection, the biological traits that define this enhanced transmissibility remained to be fully elucidated. In this renewal application, we are proposing 3 Specific Aims that combine cohort-level viral genetics analyses, in vitro phenotypic characterization, as well as an in vivo model for HIV-1 transmission, to define the viral properties that are advantageous during transmission. These approaches together have the potential to provide more definitive information on whether there are biological phenotypes of HIV-1 that are linked to transmission and could be targeted for intervention. Specifically we will:  1. Define specific virologic traits that correlate with the selection of more consensus-like viruses through a  broad analysis of subtype A and C transmission pairs, coupled with novel assay methodologies.  2. Characterize the nature, impact and extent of selection bias across genomic regions and subtypes using  a novel PacBio sequencing approach to define the donor quasispecies and the TF virus.  3. Determine, using humanized BLT mice, whether preferential transmission of TF viruses over donor-  matched NT viruses occurs in this model and reveals viral and host determinants of transmission. A knowledge gap remains in our understanding of the genetic bottleneck associated with HIV-1 transmission. The experiments proposed will narrow this gap by conducting a thorough interrogation of the biological characteristics of the transmitted founder virus that are linked to its preferential transmission, using an expanded panel of transmission pairs from two African cohorts and novel technologies that have not been applied in this setting. Such traits, if defined, could provide new avenues for specifically targeting prevention approaches to the viruses most likely to initiate new infections."
"9631563","PROJECT SUMMARY Gastrointestinal (GI) motility and defecation are absolute prerequisites for nutrient absorption, fecal elimination and overall health.  Normal GI motility, vascular perfusion, and intestinal inflammation are coordinated by vast numbers of neurons that reside within ganglia of the enteric nervous system (ENS) intrinsic to the gut wall.  While recent work has identified diverse genes that direct the initial development of progenitor cells that give rise to enteric neurons in the wall of the intestine, we know very little about the genes that are expressed in adult enteric neurons.  Consequently we are unable to determine whether efforts to generate enteric neurons produce the normal complement of cell types.  Moreover we do not fully understand how distinct types of neurons contribute to overall coordination of intestinal motility because the use of common immunohistochemical markers alone does not distinguish functionally distinct subtypes.  As a result, our abilities to target and functionally manipulate specific types of neurons in the gut are extremely limited.  To surpass these limitations, our application proposes to develop a comprehensive, single cell transcriptome map of adult enteric neurons in normal mice in parallel with deep sequencing of enteric ganglia from distinct regions of human intestine so that a global gene expression atlas of human enteric ganglia is obtained.  To capture mouse enteric neurons for single cell RNA-Seq we will use a fluorescent transgenic mouse line that we developed for live-cell imaging of enteric neurons.  Human enteric ganglia will be collected by laser capture microdissection from adult surgical remnants.  Comparison of enteric neuron expression profiles between mouse and human data sets will identify conserved genes that mark distinct neuronal subtypes. The resulting expression atlas of enteric neurons will define specific molecular fingerprints for discrete neuron subtypes that are essential to pursue targeted, functional manipulation of GI motility in distinct regions of the intestine."
"9616979","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The goal of this study is a pre-clinical evaluation of nonsense readthrough as a potential therapy for inherited vascular disorders caused by mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway. We will evaluate two drugs with complementary properties. Ataluren is a FDA-designated orphan drug in phase 3 trials for two genetic disorders. It promotes readthrough of nonsense mutations without affecting the level of mRNA transcript and is most effective against UGA stop codons. Amlexanox is an anti-allergy drug that also promotes nonsense readthrough, but does so by inhibiting nonsense- mediated mRNA decay. Information on its codon specificity is limited, but it may show higher activity than ataluren against UAG codons. We will test the comparative effects of these two compounds on mutations that underlie two distinct but related vascular disorders: hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The mutation spectrum in these two disorders in complementary, with UGA codons predominating in PAH, whereas UAG/UAA mutations are more common in HHT. PAH is a life-threatening and incurable disease affecting the lung vasculature that is in desperate need of new therapies to tackle the underlying molecular changes that drive vascular remodeling. HHT affects blood vessels throughout the body and has high morbidity associated with arteriovenous malformations in the lungs and brain. Rarely, HHT patients may also develop PAH. We will utilize a combination of (a) a novel dual-tag in vitro reporter construct that we have developed to measure readthrough efficiency and sequence the resulting protein product, (b) patient-derived endothelial cells with defined genetic mutations to study functional restoration of cell signaling and (c) a novel knock-in mouse model with a nonsense mutation for in vivo testing. In the US alone, correction of nonsense mutations could benefit 6000-12,000 people affected with HHT and up to 1000 with PAH. Successful completion of this study will establish the effectiveness of this approach in vivo and define the sub-groups o patients most likely to respond. In addition, the novel dual-tag reporter that we have developed to measure both the efficiency of readthrough and the nature of the amino acid that is incorporated will be generalizable to many other genetic disorders The results of this study could translate rapidly to interventional human trials and pave the way for personalized approaches to therapy for genetic vascular diseases."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 20% to 53% of excess deaths during spousal bereavement. Stress, depression, and anxiety enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Indeed, psychological stress and depression promote transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) activation, a prime pathway for upregulating proinflammatory cytokine production. Importantly, inflammation is central to all stages of cardiovascular disease from initial lesion to end-stage thrombotic complications. Inflammation may be a key mechanism underlying CVD among the bereaved. Attachment theory is a useful framework for understanding individual differences in people's ability to adjust to the loss of a loved one. There are two patterns of attachment insecurity: attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. People with high attachment anxiety use hyperactivating emotional coping strategies. People with high attachment avoidance are uncomfortable depending on others for support and use deactivating coping strategies that inhibit or suppress distressing experiences. Individual differences in attachment style may be prognostic for who is most at risk for enhanced inflammation and ultimately CVD after the loss of a spouse. Cardiac vagal tone (as reflected by respiratory sinus arrhythmia or RSA) is associated with self-regulation. Under stressful conditions individuals with low RSA display poorer self-regulatory control compared to those with high RSA. Low vagal tone is also a risk factor for CVD, partly due to elevations in inflammation. Recent work by this new/early stage investigator suggests that RSA and attachment style may jointly influence adjustment to a loss. This project builds upon these preliminary findings to examine mechanistic connections among attachment insecurity, depression, RSA, and inflammation cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with data on these key dimensions collected 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the spouse's death. Participants will be spouses of patients who recently passed away to stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and matched controls. If inflammation is an important mechanism underlying bereavement, both psychosocial and pharmaceutical interventions aimed at reducing inflammation would be an important step toward the development of treatments for bereaved individuals. These interventions may be especially important for people with certain psychological characteristics."
"9406340","Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is clinically used to treat hemodynamic instability and O2 carrying deficits in patients with acute blood loss, and patients with chronic anemia caused by bone marrow failure/suppression (1-4). Currently, cold storage of human RBCs (hRBCs) can preserve hRBCs for a maximum of six weeks (i.e. 42 days) (5). This relatively short ex vivo storage length has been set by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) based on the post transfusion viability (PTV) of stored hRBCs at 24 hours, which must be greater than or equal to 75 ± 9% (7) and the percent hemolysis of stored hRBCs which must be less than 1% (8). Despite widespread clinical use, stored RBCs face two major problems, namely: the steadily decreasing supply of RBC units (1, 9, 10), and the questionable clinical safety of RBCs stored for extended periods of time (11-17). The supply of RBCs is expected to diminish as the population base ages and demand increases (1, 9, 10, 18). As stored RBCs age, they undergo biochemical and biophysical changes that are often referred to as the storage lesion (8, 19-24).  It is well known that upon transfusion of stored RBCs, there is a population of RBCs (i.e. healthy RBCs) that circulate for more than 24 hours, and another smaller population (i.e. damaged RBCs) that are cleared within 24 hours post transfusion (54). This population of cells destined to be cleared quickly can be higher than 25% in units stored for a mean of 30 days. Therefore, it could be clinically beneficial if the damaged RBCs in any unit of RBCs could be separated leaving a population of only healthy RBCs behind for transfusion. When a recipient is transfused with a dose of RBCs that overwhelms their circulatory system's ability to compensate for the increased intravascular volume, heart failure can ensue. This condition is known as Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO). It is the second leading cause of death related to transfusion reported to the FDA (106). We hypothesize that reducing the amount of soon to be cleared RBCs from older units by 25% and fresher units by 15% will reduce the volume of transfused product, thereby reducing the risk of death from TACO. In fact, as the incidence of TACO is usually quite underestimated as it is often not appreciated as a transfusion reaction, and as the transfusion community has undertaken several large scale initiatives to reduce the incidence of the most common cause of death as reported to the FDA (transfusion related acute lung injury, TRALI), TACO will likely surpass TRALI as the leading cause of transfusion related mortality (52). Thus, taking steps to reduce the incidence of TACO will have far reaching benefits for many recipients of RBCs.  Utilizing technology that exploits the intrinsic magnetization of the deoxygenated form of Hb inside RBC's in an applied magnetic field, the Yazer, Chalmers and Zborowski laboratories (6) demonstrated that RBCs lose magnetization during storage, which indicates that the aged RBCs lose Hb during storage. Furthermore, Chalmers and Zborowski have demonstrated technology capable of exploiting the intrinsic magnetization of deoxygenated Hb to perform a bulk separation of RBCs based on Hb content (55, 56). In this application, we hypothesize that RBCs with higher Hb content (i.e. healthy RBCs) correlate with higher deformability and PTV versus RBCs with lower Hb content (i.e. damaged RBCs). To test this hypothesis, we propose to further develop and optimize our magnetic separation technology to fractionate aged RBCs into different sub-fractions based on Hb content and Hb magnetic susceptibility, Characterize the biophysical and biochemical properties of these different sub-fractions of stored RBCs during storage and transfuse these different sub-fractions into an animal model with antioxidant status similar to humans to assess their ability to reduce/prevent systemic hypertension and oxidative tissue injury, both side-effects of exposure to cell-free Hb. This work is significant, since new technology will be developed to facilitate bulk separation of RBCs without labelling the cells to make the resulting RBC unit safer for clinical use."
"9457098","PROJECT SUMMARY  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an especially virulent form of lung cancer that is only transiently responsive to therapy and kills about 30,000 Americans each year. Based on a more general interest in understanding why certain kinds of cancers have characteristic genotypes, we are developing methods for studying the initiation of human cancers by genetically modifying cells at discrete stages of differentiation after chemical induction of specific lineages from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We have extended recently published methods for inducing hESCs to form parts of the pulmonary lineage by perturbing NOTCH signaling and reducing expression of the RB1 gene (one of the two genes commonly inactivated in SCLC); in this way, we have prepared cultures with high proportions of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), the putative precursors of SCLC. Moreover, by also reducing expression of P53, the other gene commonly inactivated in SCLC, PNEC-containing cultures are able to produce small tumors resembling SCLC when implanted in immune-deficient mice.  We now propose to expand our studies of this promising model for studying the origins of SCLC in several ways: by determining the mechanisms by which interference with NOTCH and RB1 generates PNECs; by exploring several possible assays for the SCLC-like phenotype we have recently observed; by defining the similarities between the genetic and physiological features of the SCLCs derived from hESCs and the SCLCs arising in human patients; and by making induced pleuropotent stem cells (iPSCs) from normal and tumor cells from patients with lung cancer, especially SCLC, in an effort to seek genetic risk factors for SCLC. Through these studies, we expect to generate new information and ideas about risk assessment, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for SCLC. !"
"9470617","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The leading cause of death in the US is heart disease, and the global problem of obesity is an important risk factor. Additionally, the offspring of overweight and obese women are more likely than those born to normal- weight women to develop cardiovascular disease as adults. This is especially distressing because over two- thirds of reproductive-age women are overweight or obese in the US. Work in mice has shown that maternal obesity programs mitochondrial dysfunction via germ-line changes and transmission of damaged oocyte mitochondria across three generations. The long-term goals of this applicant are to define the mechanisms by which maternal obesity impairs cardiac health in subsequent, non-obese generations and identify therapies to prevent adverse outcomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop a multigenerational model of cardiac deficiencies arising from maternal obesity. This model will then be used to test the central hypothesis that impaired cardiac function in offspring is due to a feed-forward loop in which offspring inherit damaged mitochondria that disrupt energy signaling, leading to further mitochondrial damage. This hypothesis is founded on preliminary and published work showing that when mice (F0) were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet from before conception and through weaning, they gained significant weight and developed peripheral insulin resistance; their F1 progeny developed heart disease as adults; and their F1, F2, and F3 descendants had misshapen and dysfunctional mitochondria in their skeletal muscle and oocytes, despite consuming a control diet. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two aims. Aim 1 will establish a multigenerational model of cardiac deficiencies arising from maternal obesity. Echocardiography will be used to measure cardiac function and high- resolution respirometry will be used to measure mitochondrial function in the F1 through F3 offspring of obese F0 dams. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that F1 through F3 offspring of obese dams have disturbed cardiac function due to defective cardiac mitochondria, disrupted autophagy, and increased lipid storage. Offspring will be treated with an activator of the low-energy state sensing protein AMP-activate protein kinase (AMPK). Activation of AMPK should enhance autophagy, and therefore result in diminished lipid droplet quantity and removal of dysfunctional/damaged mitochondria. Moreover, activation of AMPK should increase fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis, replenishing the pool of healthy mitochondria and restoring cardiac metabolic homeostasis, ultimately improving cardiovascular health. Completion of these aims will yield several basic science outcomes that are significant because they will add to our understanding of the relationship between maternal obesity and offspring cardiovascular health. The proposed studies support a postdoctoral training plan that includes interdisciplinary technical training, scientific meetings, and consultation with leaders in both cardiovascular and developmental biology fields, which will prepare the applicant to transition to independence as an investigator."
"9546079","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an emerging epidemic of liver disease in the US and the basis for a rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH-associated fibrosis, regardless of other histologic features such as inflammation, is the major predictor of long-term outcomes in patients. Accordingly, there are increas- ing numbers of clinical drug trials to slow down or reverse fibrosis progression in patients with NASH. However, no drugs have been approved yet for widespread use. The direct fibrogenic mediators of liver fibrosis are he- patic stellate cells (HSCs), which become activated/differentiate into myofibroblasts that deposit excessive ex- tracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in an aberrant wound healing cascade. The stiff matrix produced by activated HSCs leads to the loss of major functions in hepatocytes. The differentiation of HSCs into myofibroblasts and their interactions with hepatocytes in NASH is the result of the complex crosstalk between numerous microen- vironmental signals. Thus, treating NASH-associated fibrosis effectively will require understanding and inter- rupting this complex crosstalk that distorts liver architecture and leads to liver decompensation. Differences across species in drug metabolism and disease pathways necessitate supplementation of animal data with human-relevant in vitro assays. Despite important progress in the development of culture techniques to stabilize the phenotype of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) in culture for several weeks, there is a need to develop a platform that enables the investigation of PHH-HSC interactions within physiological and disease settings. We have developed a cellular microarray that allows simultaneous modulation of the size/composition of patterned ECM protein domains, substrate stiffness, and soluble factor concentrations, while also enabling parallel measurements of cellular phenotype and contractility. Here, we will adapt this cellular microarray to test our hypothesis that the ECM protein composition, substrate stiffness, and soluble factors act collectively to modulate the phenotypes of PHHs and HSCs and their interactions in an NASH-like microenvironment. Our approach will enable hypothesis-driven studies incorporating controlled perturbations of extracellular signals. In aim 1, we will examine the effects of ECM composition and substrate stiffness on long-term phenotypic re- sponses of PHHs under normal and NASH-inducing conditions. In aim 2, we will investigate the cooperative microenvironmental regulation of the activation states of primary human HSCs. In aim 3, we will develop a co- culture approach to determine the roles of reciprocal interactions between PHHs and HSCs and establish a platform for evaluating NASH-relevant therapeutics. Our studies will reveal mechanisms underlying phenotypic alterations of human HSCs and PHHs, including interconnections between biochemical and biomechanical sig- nals. These efforts will aid the development of drugs aimed at reversing fibrosis."
"9615670","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stem cells have critical roles in development and homeostasis; understanding their biology is essential for re- generative medicine, preventing and treating cancer, and developing therapies to combat aging and degenera- tive disease. Important to many stem cell systems are interactions with endocrine factors, for regulating cell cycling, fate-speci cation or differentiation. One such factor is thyroid hormone (TH), which has diverse and often opposing effects across stem cell lineages, and for which defects in signaling lead to mental and physical retardation, peripheral neuropathies, infertility and other disorders. These studies use zebra sh adult pigmen- tation as an innovative and tractable system for elucidating TH functions in differentiation and morphogenesis as well as homeostasis and neoplasia. Adult pigment cells of zebra sh arise from neural crest-derived latent stem or progenitor cells that differentiate during the larval-to-adult transformation, a period that shares similari- ties with late fetal, neonatal and adolescent stages of mammals. Preliminary analyses demonstrated that TH represses the development of black melanophores, homologous to mammalian melanocytes, but promotes the development of yellow/orange xanthophores. Studies in Aim 1 will uncover the cellular bases for these effects, focusing on whether TH speci es alternative fates or promotes terminal differentiation within de ned progenitor lineages, and whether TH modulates morphogenetic behaviors of proliferation, migration or survival. Additional analyses will test for later TH-dependent homeostasis of these lineages and whether TH protects against melanoma onset or progression, as hypothyroidism is signi cantly more prevalent in human melanoma pa- tients than in the general population. Studies in Aim 2 will elucidate molecular mechanisms of TH activities in pigment stem cell lineages by testing roles for canonical ( genomic ) signaling, in which liganded TH receptors directly modulate target gene transcription, and non-canonical mechanisms, in which TH promotes cytoskeletal changes and interacts with a variety of signaling pathways. Additional analyses will test two molecular mecha- nisms that are excellent candidates for mediating TH effects on pigment cells, via hypoxia inducible factor 1? or signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinases Kit and Colony stimulating factor-1 receptor. Experiments in Aims 1 and 2 will employ an innovative suite of approaches including genetic analyses of new mutants, ma- nipulation of TH status using a conditional transgenic line and lineage-speci c transgenic effectors, single cell- fate mapping, and high-resolution time-lapse imaging. Together, these studies will answer several of the most important questions about TH activities in pigmentation while establishing a highly accessible system for ad- dressing TH functions in stem cells more generally."

These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."
"9430471","Project Summary The coronary vasculature plays essential roles in maintaining a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Coronary heart disease is a major cause of myocardial infarction and heart failure, which continues to be the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Despite its importance, the mechanisms that regulate coronary vascularization of the myocardium remain a major gap in our knowledge. We observed that during zebrafish heart development, coronary vessels form a close association with a specific subpopulation of cortical cardiomyocytes marked by the transcription factor Gata4. gata4+ cardiomyocytes follow the tracks of coronary endothelial cells when they emerge onto the surface of the juvenile zebrafish hearts. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that expression of the Cxcl12b chemokine, a critical angiogenic factor during zebrafish coronary vessel development, is increased in expanding gata4+ cardiomyocytes. Moreover, gata4+ cardiomyocytes fail to associate with coronary vessels in hearts lacking Cxcr4a, the receptor for Cxcl12b. Importantly, adult cxcr4a mutant zebrafish fail to regenerate after heart injury. We hypothesize that heart development occurs in two phases that are regulated by temporally distinct mechanisms: newly formed coronary endothelial cells provide instructive cues, such as paracrine factors, during the emerging phase to guide gata4+ cardiomyocytes when they emerge, while during the expanding phase, cxcl12b expression increases in gata4+ cardiomyocytes to attract coronary vessels that are essential for their morphogenesis/development and regeneration. We propose to 1) To determine how new coronary vessels guide gata4+ cardiomyocytes to populate the heart ventricle by analyzing differentially expressed candidate genes identified from RNAseq encoding secreted molecules (e.g. cxcr4, erbb4) using CRISPR mutant fish lines and a novel explant culture system; 2) To determine how coronary vessels affect morphogenesis and the regenerative capacity of gata4+ cardiomyocytes during myocardial expansion using multicolor clonal analysis and by manipulating Cxcl12-Cxcr4 chemokine signaling. We will further determine how cxcl12b expression is regulated by hypoxia and Gata4. Our proposed study will reveal potential developmental causes of coronary heart diseases. Furthermore, elucidation of the mechanisms underlying myocardial vascularization in zebrafish will shed light on potential therapeutic approaches for humans."
"9509781","PROJECT SUMMARY Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the major cause of prostate cancer (PCa) mortality. Targeting the androgens-androgen receptor (AR) axis by the second-generation endocrine therapies such as abiraterone (ABI) and enzalutamide (ENZ) has been effective initially for CRPC treatment in clinic. However, most patients develop resistance that undermines survival and quality of life and the therapy resistance is likely due to expression of AR splice variants (AR-Vs) such as AR-V7 and/or other undefined mechanisms. Prostate- specific antigen (PSA or known as KLK3) is one of the genes that are highly transcriptionally activated by AR. Despite being extensively utilized as a biomarker for PCa diagnosis and prognosis, the significance of the PSA gene or the entire genomic locus of this gene in PCa growth and survival has yet been well established. We demonstrated that non-coding RNA transcribed from the PSA enhancer, or called PSA eRNA, is aberrantly upregulated in CRPC cells in culture, xenografts and patient tissues. We further showed that expression of PSA eRNA is regulated by AR-Vs in ENZ-resistant CRPC cells. Moreover, we showed that PSA eRNA has cis-effects on PSA mRNA expression as well as broad trans-effects on expression of AR-regulated biologically important genes in CRPC cells. Mechanistically, we found that PSA eRNA contains a HIV-1 TAR RNA like (TAR-L) motif that is crucial for binding to CYCLIN T1, a key component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex and P-TEFb-mediated RNA polymerase II serine 2 phosphorylation (Pol II-Ser2p). Importantly, we demonstrated that targeting PSA eRNA with generation 2.5 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) inhibits growth of ENZ-resistant CRPC cells. Our further studies showed that eRNA transcribed from the FTO gene enhancer, one of the AR-eRNAs induced by ENZ, binds to RNA splicing factors and regulates expression of AR splice variant AR-V7 in ENZ-resistant CRPC cells. These findings support the hypothesis that aberrant expression of AR-eRNAs including PSA and FTO eRNAs acts as a new proxy of AR functional abnormality that promotes endocrine therapy-resistant growth of CRPC, thereby representing a novel target for CRPC treatment. In this application, we will determine the mechanisms by which PSA eRNA regulates gene transcription and FTO eRNA regulates AR-V7 expression in ENZ-resistant CRPC cells (Aim 1) and to determine the functional importance and clinical significance of PSA eRNA expression in ENZ- and ABI- resistant CRPC cells using mouse models and human patient samples (Aim 2). These studies will employ a comprehensive approach bringing complementary expertise in tumor biology, molecular biology, medical oncology, pathobiology, computing science and bioinformatics and biomedical statistics. Findings from the proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms that drives aberrant AR activity and therapy-resistant growth of CRPC cells, but also allow us to develop new strategies by targeting PSA eRNA to inhibit aberrant AR activity for effective treatment of CRPC."
"9619234","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many HIV cure studies are planned or expected. These studies often involve high or unknown risks, raising serious ethical challenges concerning (I) risk/benefit ratios, (II) informed consent, and (III) trust in investigators. Little empirical r philosophical research into these challenges is available. The proposed study will use modeling to assess objective risks from various HIV cure interventions, use surveys to assess patients' and investigators' risk ethical approval and willingness to partake in those studies, and use philosophical analysis to make related recommendations on the ethical conduct of HIV cure studies. Innovation: The proposed study is innovative in several ways: (a) It will apply CEPAC modeling, which has been validated in other contexts, to investigate the new area of HIV cure interventions; (b) It will use our ready access to the large ACTG network, which has successfully supported other surveys, for a large survey of patients and clinicians on something for which no survey currently exists-ethics and willingness to participate in risky HIV cure studies; (c) It is the first large study to thoroughly examine these philosophical challenges in HIV cure studies; (d) It will translate ethics insights from early phase cancer studies, other first-in-human studies and elsewhere into practical recommendations for ethical HIV cure research, to guide investigators, funders, and IRBs, honed with key stakeholders. Approach: We will first compile and catalogue conceivable responses to the ethical challenge of HIV cure studies. Some responses will be immediately screened out for obvious logical, practical, or ethical flaws (Filte A). Among remaining responses, we shall assess the risks of cure interventions comprising them (Aim 1). We shall also conduct surveys to check how much HIV patients and clinicians in 34 US-based ACTG sites are willing to partake in studies that involve similar risk levels, and how morally acceptable they would find such studies (Aim 2). Combined, Aims 1 and 2 will rule out some responses to the challenge as infeasible (Filter B). Then, we shall assess the ethics of remaining responses to the challenge (Filter C) and make recommendations on how to conduct HIV cure studies ethically (Aim 3). Our draft recommendations will be presented to HIV cure decision makers, IRB members, and other key stakeholders to obtain feedback and hone the recommendations. (Filter D). We propose the following aims:  1. Assess through modeling the risk from HIV cure study participation for various patient populations.  2. Empirically assess HIV investigators' and HIV patients' ethical evaluation and willingness to partake in HIV cure studies involving given risk levels.  3. Use these results, along with philosophical analysis, published ethics literature, feedback from our Board of Advisors, and feedback from key stakeholders, to form model ethical recommendations for  HIV cure research."
"9418004","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The gender gap in alcohol use and problem drinking is closing. The development of effective prevention programs for young women requires an in-depth understanding of the environmental conditions that protect against or elevate liability to risky drinking and the differences between racial/ethnic groups in the relative influences of those factors. This secondary data analysis project builds on the documented differences between African-American (AA) and White young women in the prevalence of alcohol use, alcohol use disorders (AUDs), and risk factors associated with AUDs to examine possible distinctions in transitions through drinking course, with the goal of refining models of alcohol use and misuse in AA girls and young women. The underrepresentation of AA females in large-scale alcohol studies has made investigations of the fine-grain alcohol phenotypes that capture the dynamic nature of alcohol use (e.g., rate of progression from first drink to problem drinking) very challenging. The proposed early stage investigator R01 addresses this gap in alcohol research by analyzing data from three large-scale studies of alcohol use and related psychopathology in young AA and White women (twin, high-risk family and urban adolescent/young adult samples, total n=6,705, 33% AA), each of which collected detailed alcohol use history and information on psychiatric and psychosocial conditions in multiple waves of data collection. The project focuses in particular on the role of two early environmental factors that differ by race: childhood trauma, a potent risk factor for a range of psychiatric conditions, and parental monitoring, an important target of study because of its modifiability. The timing of marijuana use initiation is also examined as a possible modifier of drinking course because of the elevated prevalence of use and initiation of use before alcohol in AA young women. The proposed project is designed to (1) identify distinctions between AA and White young women in the timing of transitions between stages of alcohol use and of initiation of alcohol relative to marijuana use; (2) examine differences by race in factors that contribute to early trauma and parental monitoring as well as the subsequent influence of these early environmental factors on alcohol outcomes; and (3) explore sources of variability in the contribution of early trauma and parental monitoring to the progression of alcohol use (e.g., interaction of early trauma with genetic liability to AUDs). Findings will lead to improvements in assessment of risk and protective factors for early and problem drinking in AA and White young women and guide culturally appropriate prevention efforts."
"9416971","Project Summary  Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying genomic instability and tumorigenesis is the long-term goal of my laboratory. The broad objective, of this proposal, reflects our pursuit to gain a comprehensive understanding of the network involved in DNA repair and to determine how these proteins and pathways intersect, interact, communicate, coordinate, and collaborate for genome maintenance. The short-term goal is to perform detailed mechanistic studies of several DNA damage signaling and repair pathways, which will provide the foundation to achieve our long-term goal of exploiting DNA repair network for cancer therapy.  This proposal will define two overlapping DNA damage-signaling pathways that together are essential for cell survival. We and other researchers have constructed an elaborate signaling pathway that acts downstream of H2AX and regulates the recruitment and accumulation of many DNA damage repair proteins at sites of DNA breaks. This H2AX-dependent pathway is composed of H2AX, MDC1, RNF8, and RNF168. However, repair defects observed in H2AX-, MDC1-, RNF8-, or RNF168-deficient cells or mice are mild, raising the possibility that there is an H2AX-independent mechanism involved in the recruitment of these downstream repair proteins. We propose that this H2AX-independent pathway is controlled by NBS1.  On the basis of our previous studies and preliminary data presented in this proposal, we hypothesize that the H2AX- and NBS1-dependent pathways are involved in the DNA damage response and are critical for cell survival. We believe that these two pathways have redundant functions, especially in promoting homologous recombination repair. However, they are not completely separate, since they intersect at multiple points. This makes it considerably challenging for us to delineate the functions of these two redundant pathways. It is unknown whether we can elucidate the contribution of a single pathway to the ever-growing network, i.e., can we untangle the network to understand the mechanisms by which different pathways intersect and contribute to biological processes? We will address this question in this application and we will further study the mechanisms by which the H2AX- and NBS1-dependent pathways act together to ensure cell survival and the completion of DNA repair. We propose the following specific aims: 1) determine whether NBS1 acts redundantly with the established H2AX-MDC1-RNF8-RNF168 pathway to ensure cell survival; 2) delineate the NBS1-dependent pathway; and 3) explore the mechanisms underlying cell lethality caused by NBS1 and H2AX co-depletion. These studies will not only allow us to understand the redundant functions of H2AX and NBS1 in vivo but will also reveal ways to investigate the functions of proteins and pathways in today?s complex signaling networks. Moreover, results from these studies will provide the rationale for exploiting DNA repair defect and applying synthetic lethality concept in precision medicine for cancer patients."

"9429125","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine repeat in the protein huntingtin (mHtt), and is manifested by choreatic dyskinesias, personality changes, abnormal behaviors and cognitive deterioration. With the exception of symptomatic treatments there are no disease-modifying therapies for HD. Although mHtt is expressed ubiquitously in brain and peripheral tissue, it predominantly causes neuronal loss and damage in striatal tissue, a process that is poorly understood. Therefore, studies that define the mechanisms that contribute to the striatal degeneration are needed to develop new drugs that prevent and/or delay the onset of HD. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of striatal-specific proteins in HD pathogenesis for preventive and therapeutic purposes. The objective here, which is next step in pursuit of that goal, is to dissect the mechanisms of Rhes GTPase, that contains SUMO E3 ligase activity, in HD pathogenesis, and to identify its physiological SUMO substrates. Our central hypothesis is that Rhes-SUMO1-mHtt-mTORC1 circuitry elicits mitochondrial damage and HD pathogenesis. This hypothesis is formulated on the basis of our previous studies, new data and preliminary results. Our Aims are: 1: Dissect the role of Rhes-SUMO-mHtt-mTORC1 circuitry in mitochondrial dysfunction. Multiple studies support the role of Rhes in HD, but the mechanisms are unknown. Here we will dissect the mechanisms, using striatal cells, focusing on the Rhes-SUMO1 in mTORC1 activity and mitochondrial dysfunction; and 2: Challenge the deletion of SUMO1 in the amelioration of HD pathogenesis in mice. Despite known roles for SUMO1 in mHtt-induced cellular toxicity, its role in the pathogenesis of HD in mammal remains unknown. We will cross SUMO1-/- mice with N171HD mouse to elucidate behavioral and pathological outcomes; and 3: Identify SUMOylation substrates for Rhes. Besides SUMOylating mHtt, Rhes physiologically SUMOylates several striatal proteins, but their identity remains unknown. Using cell culture, in vitro SUMOylation assay, and proteomic approaches we will identify potential SUMO substrates for Rhes. Overall, the project is innovative because it employs an interdisciplinary approach, utilizing tools from mouse genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and behavior to dissect the pathway leading to striatal-specific cell loss. The results of this project will be significant, as it will advance our understanding of why striatal tissue is preferentially ost in an mHtt- dependent fashion and provide proof-of-principle for the development of drugs targeting Rhes signaling in HD."
"9455392","Abstract Myopia (near-sightedness) refers to the ocular condition in which there is a mismatch between the eye's optical power and its length, typically the product of increased scleral remodeling and eye elongation during childhood and/or adolescence, and leading to blurred distance vision. Myopia is associated with increased risk of potentially blinding pathologies, including glaucoma, maculopathies and retinal detachments, with risks increasing with the level of myopia. Myopia is now one of the leading causes of acquired blindness worldwide. Interestingly, a number of epidemiological studies have reported myopia to be more common among females who also show faster progression of the disease, while realizing poorer clinical outcomes. Traditionally, these apparent sex-specific differences have been attributed to behavioral differences, with little supportive scientific evidence. However, associations between myopia and growth spurts and early menarche as well as accelerated progression around puberty have also been reported. The project described here is based on the hypothesis that the observed sex-related bias in myopia reflects, at least in part, sex-specific, endocrine-related influences on the sclera, as has been observed in other connective tissues in the body. The over-riding goal of proposed research is understand the role and related mechanisms for endocrine regulation of scleral and thus eye growth. Unpublished pilot data has confirmed the expression of key class III sex hormone receptors in the sclera of young chicks, which will be used as our myopia model. Under Aim 1, we will profile scleral sex hormone receptors and related enzymes during development in young normal chicks, age-matched chicks induced to undergo precocious puberty and chicks reaching puberty naturally (validation step). Age-related changes in circulating levels of key sex hormones will also be measured. Experiments will investigate how expression of scleral sex hormone receptors and related enzymes vary, at both the gene and protein levels, with age and the onset of puberty, with sex being an over- riding variable. Local scleral and systemic levels of key ligands and enzymes will also be assessed. Precocious puberty will be induced using systemic tamoxifen. This approach takes into account practical and time constraints of an R21 grant. Under Aim 2, we will determine how transcriptional and translational levels of sex hormone receptors and enzymes, as well as local scleral sex hormone levels, change during myopia development in tamoxifen-treated compared to normal chicks. In experiments under both Aims, RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses will be undertaken to examine gene and protein expression and LC-MS/MS used to assess local scleral and systemic levels of key ligands. An improved understanding of the link between sex and myopia prevalence and severity has potentially broad implications related to environmental endocrine disruptors and the timing of school vision screening programs, as well as for the individual patient, customization of clinical intervention strategies for myopia control."

"9418593","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overarching goal is to discover the genetic and genomic mechanisms underlying behavioral predisposition and development of addiction. Addiction remains a substantial worldwide social and economic burden despite extensive efforts to curb drug availability and use. The high heritability of drug addiction, especially for cocaine, indicates that the propensity to develop a substance use disorder after initial exposure is genetically influenced. Both human and animal studies indicate that behavioral traits such as novelty seeking and novelty preference are strongly correlated with the propensity to develop a substance use disorder, but the biological basis of this relationship is unknown. We propose to identify biological mechanisms of addiction and predisposing behavior by harnessing recent advances in mouse genetic resources, including the high-precision Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population, validation in genetically modified mice, gene expression quantitation through RNA sequence analysis, and computational and statistical methods in systems genetics. In Aim 1 we will identify genetic mechanisms underlying predisposing novelty-related traits and drug self-administration through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in a large set of DO mice. The most compelling and tractable of these will be validated in gene targeted mouse models. The intravenous drug-self administration (IVSA) paradigm, considered the gold standard for the assessment of addiction in preclinical research will enable quantification of the core features of addiction including compulsive drug use, difficulty limiting drug intake, and an extremely high motivation to take the drug. In Aim 2 we will quantify gene expression genetic variation, map expression QTLs and identify genetic correlates of predisposing behavior using RNAseq in a drug-naïve subset of DO mice, and disseminate these results through widely used informatics resources. Gene expression analysis in drug-naïve mice enables separation of the biological substrates of predisposition to addiction from the biological sequelae of drug exposure. By using RNA sequencing, we will be able to quantify isoforms and allelic variants in the face of genetic diversity. In Aim 3, we will address the fundamental problem of relating genetic variation in gene expression in drug-naïve individuals to genetic variation in drug self-administration behavior by utilizing predisposing behavioral traits as a reference. This will be accomplished through the use of multivariate statistical methods in an approach we term reference trait genetics. This strategy makes use of a common collection of phenotypes to relate disparate and incompatible measures across two independent sets of mice. Development of this technique in the context of addiction research will extend the application of outbred populations to a wide range of applications in health and disease. Each aim will independently deliver basic research results and resources of interest to addiction biologists, including gene expression QTLs, addiction related genetic loci, and expression correlates of addiction related behavior. Synergy among the aims will reveal networks from polymorphism to addiction related behavior."
"9414619","Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are naturally occurring polydisperse linear polysaccharides that are heavily O- and N-sulfated. The interaction between GAGs and proteins are critical for many biological processes including cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, cell migration and proliferation, growth factor sequestration, chemokine and cytokine activation, microbial recognition and tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. Hundreds of HS-binding proteins have been identified, but the oligosaccharide structures that mediate particular interactions have been defined in only a few cases due to the structural complexity of HS. These challenges will be achieved through activities in three Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects that will be applied to the study of several Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) that will act as test beds for the utility of the integrated approaches and provide feedback for new challenges that will spur further technology development. As the technologies mature they will be applied to Collaborative projects and routine use in analytical Services (C&S) that will also extend the utility of the technologies to a broader scientific community. Multiple strategies for Dissemination will increase awareness and access to the technology developments and our Training courses (D&T) will provide direct opportunities for researchers to learn the latest technology developments from Resource staff. The diverse goals of the Resource require a well-structured administration and management organization with clearly defined staff responsibilities. Administration and Management of the overall technologies within the Resource will be directed by the PI with the assistance of a Steering Committee comprised of the TR&D project coordinators and an External Advisory Committee. Oversight of the TR&Ds, DBPs, C&S, Training and Dissemination will involve project coordinators and dedicated technical staff to facilitate the most efficient use of resources to advance and apply the technologies within the broad scientific community. Thus, aims for the Administration and Management of the Resource are proposed to: (1) Establish and maintain an effective administrative organization with responsibilities for oversight of Resource operations, (2) Establish and continue resource communication and evaluation procedure, (3) Provide oversight through meetings with an External Advisory Committee (EAC)."
"9406343","Abstract  Native lung surfactant (LS) consists of a mixture of lipids and proteins that together posses the ability to lower the alveolar surface tension, and thus is essential for normal breathing. While the exact mechanisms of acute lung injury (ALI), and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are currently not well understood, LS inactivation by surface active inhibitory proteins, enzymes, fatty acids and lyso-lipids are believed to play a contributing role. Published and preliminary work reveals that even small fractions of ARDS-implicated components may change the surface viscosity and elasticity of monolayers by orders of magnitude: thousand-fold increases in phospholipid monolayer stiffness when saturated fatty acids are added or albumin adsorbs, whereas 100-1000-fold decreases occur when 1-2% cholesterol is added.  These results suggest a plausible mechanical mechanism for ARDS progression, and the central hypothesis of the proposed project: that the rheological (e.g. viscous and elastic) properties of ARDS- inactivated LS play a central, causative role in the ARDS cascade, and in the inability of RS therapies to effectively reverse ARDS progression. An initial insult to the lung introduces blood proteins through permeabilized alveolar walls, and heightened levels of the enzyme PLA2, as part of the inflammatory response. Previous results suggest that either of these situations would create heterogeneous, rheologically elastic domains deep in the lung: PLA2 by digesting phospholipids to produce lyso-lipids and fatty acids, and blood proteins through adsorption. Well-known phenomena in continuum mechanics suggest that elastic heterogeneities within the LS strongly resist the curvature changes that occur naturally during respiration, and may even `crack' or `crumple' rather than deform smoothly. Such abnormal deformations would thus exert strong, localized mechanical stresses on the alveolar epithelium, promoting further tissue damage and inflammation, and ultimately to greater levels of protein and PLA2. Notably, the hypothesized mechanism is physical in origin, and derives from how the organization of these components in the LS monolayer affects their ability to flow and deform. Such a mechanism could not be uncovered from chemical assays alone.  To test this hypothesis, the impact of LS-inactivating factors (blood proteins, fatty acids, enzymes) on the rheology of model LS monolayers will be measured with first-of-their-kind techniques, as well components (e.g. natural or synthetic surfactant proteins, mono-unsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol) that may reduce or reverse the inactivation. Using both novel experimental techniques and theory, the molecular composition of inactivated LS will be related to elastic heterogeneities, and elastic heterogeneities to anisotropic alveolar inflation and deflation. Finally, the mixing and evolution of heterogeneous monolayers will be studied to identify strategies to dissolve, disrupt or displace these elastic heterogeneities, and ultimately guiding therapeutic formulations."
"9573928","Racial and ethnic minority youth have poorer asthma status than Caucasian youth, even after controlling for socioeconomic variables. Proper use of asthma controller medications is critical in reducing asthma mortality and morbidity. The clinical consequences of poor asthma management include increased illness complications, excessive functional morbidity, and fatal asthma attacks. There are significant limitations in research on interventions to improve asthma management in racial minority populations, particularly minority adolescents and young adults, though illness management tends to deteriorate after adolescence during emerging adulthood, the unique developmental period beyond adolescence but before adulthood. All elements of the proposed study protocol were piloted in an NHLBI-funded pilot study (1R34HL107664-01A1 MacDonell). Results suggested feasibility and acceptability of the study protocol as well as proof of concept. We are now ready to test the intervention in a larger randomized clinical trial. The proposed study will include 192 African American emerging adults with moderate to severe persistent asthma and low controller medication adherence recruited from clinic and emergency department settings. Half of the sample will be randomized to receive a multi-component technology-based intervention (MCTI) targeting adherence to daily controller medication. The MCTI consists of two components: 1) 2 sessions of computer-delivered motivational interviewing targeting medication adherence, and 2) individualized text messaging focused on medication adherence between the sessions. Text messages will be individualized based on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The remaining half of participants will complete a series of computer-delivered asthma education modules matched for length, location, and method of delivery of the intervention session. Control participants will also receive text messages between intervention sessions. Message content will be the same for all control participants and contain general facts about asthma (not tailored). Youth will be recruited from the Detroit Medical Center, the only university affiliated medical center in Detroit, Michigan. It is hypothesized that youth randomized to MCTI will show improvements in adherence to medication (primary outcome) and asthma control (secondary outcome) compared to the comparison condition at all post-intervention follow ups (3, 6, 9, and 12 months)."
"9411740","Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) is an attractive technique for cellular applications. It determines kinetic and molecular properties of proteins with submicron resolution and single molecule sensitivity in the living cell. Brightness is a unique FFS parameter that specifies the average fluorescence intensity of a protein complex. Because brightness is directly proportional to the number of labeled proteins in the complex, it identifies the oligomeric state of the labeled protein. This conceptual idea has been successfully applied to measure the stoichiometry and binding curve of proteins in the living cell. We seek to build on this success by proposing projects with the potential for significant impact on quantitative cell studies that continue to push the envelope of the FFS method. The formation of ternary or higher-order protein complexes are ubiquitous features of protein interactions and play an important role in the regulation of cellular processes. However, current methods are mostly limited to the detection of interactions involving two proteins inside the cell. We seek to overcome this technical bottleneck and develop an FFS approach with the capacity to detect and characterize the interactions of ternary protein systems in the living cell. Another topic of interest is the nuclear envelope (NE), which consists of a double membrane layer that separates the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. It is now being recognized that the NE integrates a number of important cell functions, which include the regulation of signal transduction pathways and mechanical force transduction between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The NE has over 60 distinct membrane proteins, whose physical and functional interactions remain largely unexplored. Characterization of these interactions will be crucial to understand the cell biology of the NE and to develop treatments for the growing range of human disorders linked to NE proteins. To facilitate such research, we propose to develop a quantitative FFS technique that explores the interaction and oligomerization of NE proteins inside the living cell. The environment of the NE poses a unique challenge for brightness measurements, which will be addressed by a novel analysis approach. We next propose to complement FFS with photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) in order to harness the strength of both techniques. While PALM determines stoichiometry and surface density of membrane proteins at low concentrations, which are often closer to physiological conditions, FFS complements these results at high surface densities, which facilitates the detection of weak interactions. We will implement combined FFS and PALM studies and perform tests on simple model systems before moving to applications. These projects are expected to open up new avenues for exploring protein-protein interactions in cells with potential applications ranging from basic research in cell biology to pharmaceutical drug screening. Advances in FFS could help fight diseases by providing detailed information about protein interactions and may lead to the identification of targets for drug development."
"9230217","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a three-year research proposal that aims to help the principal investigator to achieve and expand the aims of her K08 award, and at the same time it will help to gather enough preliminary data to apply for federal NIH R01 grant. The principal investigator currently holds a mentored career development award, K08 AR064834-01, entitled Choline kinase: a novel target for rheumatoid arthritis and mentored by Drs. Firestein, Karin and Kavanaugh. One of the points in her career development is to develop skill sets required to conduct independent investigation in patient-oriented research in the field of Rheumatology, and more precisely to get experience in biomarker analysis using metabolomics studies. Her K08 aims to explore the role of choline metabolites and its downstream products as diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis by magnetic resonance spectrometry. Preliminary data suggest that expanding this aim into a more detailed study by mass spectrometry and realizing an untargeted study of the metabolites in both fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and serum from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will help to achieve this aim. Metabolomics is a new emerging field in biomarker research. Based on the assumption that diseases can be traced using physiological information from the metabolome, the changes in metabolite levels can be used for biomarker research. Biomarkers useful in diagnosis or predicting responses to different treatments in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remain an unmet medical need, especially in patients not responsive to TNF blockers or in patients with progressive joint damage. We have recently identified choline kinase as a potential therapeutic target in RA. Choline metabolism plays an important role in FLS functions that contribute to their aggressive behavior and joint destruction. Of interest, choline metabolism is a potential prognostic marker in oncology. Our long-term objective would be to determine suitability of choline metabolites or other metabolites as a biomarker of FLS activation and joint damage. To address this question, and as a specific goal, we will analyze more precisely choline metabolites and downstream effectors in resting FLS and after stimulation with cytokines involved in RA by magnetic resonance spectrometry (MRS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Metabolites will be analyzed in cells and supernatants to determine the most suitable metabolites as biomarkers. Untargeted analysis will also help to identify other potential biomarkers. We will also determine i metabolites detected in FLS are detectable in serum or urine samples of RA patients compared to normal and patients with other inflammatory diseases. The relationship between chosen metabolites, seropositivity, erosive disease, and disease activity as determined by DAS28 would be determined. If successful, our studies could translate into important diagnostic and prognostic tests that will identify patients at high risk for FLS activation and joint damage, and identify the most appropriate therapy."

"9527413","PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Thomas Hooven is a neonatologist and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Columbia University studying Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus; GBS), the major infectious cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. His research, under the mentorship of Dr. Adam Ratner, focuses on genes and gene networks that enable GBS to successfully colonize the maternal reproductive tract and to survive in amniotic fluid and blood during perinatal infection. Using a novel genome-wide screening technique based on next-generation sequencing of transposon-genome junctions from a saturated mutant library (Tn-seq), Dr. Hooven can accurately predict GBS genes whose protein products are necessary for bacterial growth under diverse experimental conditions. His proposed research seeks to use Tn-seq technology?in combination with ex vivo and in vivo models of colonization and invasion?to pinpoint surface-localized GBS proteins whose functions are essential for pathogenesis. Once validated by targeted knockout and antibody coincubation experiments, those proteins identified as essential for pathogenesis will be purified and tested as candidate vaccines to prevent vaginal colonization, ascending chorioamnionitis, and early-onset sepsis in clinically relevant mouse models. Recognizing that vaccine efficacy may depend on a combination of humoral and cellular immune mechanisms, this proposal also includes studies of opsonophagocytosis after antibody binding to candidate vaccine protein targets and T cell responses to immunization and vaginal colonization. By performing this research, Dr. Hooven will advance scientific understanding of GBS pathogenesis and bring society closer to a safe and effective vaccine to prevent devastating neonatal GBS infections. He will also expand his experimental repertoire through exposure to key methods in bioinformatics, immunology, molecular genetics, and vaccine development. This project will provide crucial training that will set the stage for his transition to becoming an independent investigator. Upon completion of the proposed research, Dr. Hooven will be ready to assume oversight of his own basic and translational research program aimed at advancing neonatal health through new insights into infection and new approaches toward its prevention and treatment."
"9433710","The synaptic connections in our brain form circuits that control all mental activity and behavior. How these connections are specified during brain development and function is largely unknown. The problem is difficult to study in humans or model mammals because the synaptic connections in the large brains of these species cannot currently be determined. Some mental illnesses may be due to abnormalities in synaptic connectivity?the inability to address this possibility in the absence of known connectivity is a major barrier to understanding such diseases. This study focusses on specification of synaptic connectivity in the only animal where detailed maps of synaptic connections are available. In the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, the wiring diagram, or connectome, of the entire nervous system has been determined. The C. elegans genome contains a similar set of neural cell adhesion genes thought to specify connectivity as humans. The function of these and additional genes will be studied in a neural network in the male. The expression patterns of neural cell adhesion genes in the neural network has been determined. The function of multiple neural cell adhesion genes in specification of a particular synaptic connection will be examined in detail in genetic and molecular studies. The binding properties of neural cell adhesion proteins involved in synapse formation will be determined in biochemical studies. The complement of neural cell adhesion genes that specify different connections will be compared and their activities in ectopic contexts will be examined. The aim is to uncover the molecular determinants of connectivity in the network. The results will allow studies in higher animals to focus on genes with known functions in defining neural circuits."
"9526280","Despite the availability of an effective vaccine and drugs that can suppress viral replication, hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues to impose an enormous global health burden. Over 240 million individuals are chronically HBV infected worldwide, causing chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV is classified into genotypes based on genetic diversity. The predominant genotype in West Africa, genotype E (GT/E), is generally not found elsewhere in the world however isolated cases resulting from spread directly from Africa are now being identified. HBV GT/E has low genetic diversity, a short evolutionary history, yet in less than 200 years has become the predominant HBV genotype in West Africa. With the rapid emergence of HBV GT/E in Africa and the inevitability of its spread to other continents, there is a public health urgency to understand the biology of HBV GT/E. The current HBV vaccines consist of HBsAg derived from genotype A2. Likewise, many commercial HBV screening assays utilize antibodies directed against HBsAg. Mutations in the S gene can lead to failure of commercial assays to detect HBsAg and vaccine resistance. Potentially relevant to the rapid spread of HBV GT/E high rates of ?occult disease? (HBsAg- /HBV viremia +) have been described in West Africa as well as simultaneous detection of both HBsAg and anti-HBs. Notably, HBV GT/E has a consensus mutation in the pre- S1 region introducing a new start codon; it is not known if this results in a novel S polypeptide and/or impairs translation of the other S proteins, but in total these findings raise concern that variations in S gene expression of HBV GT/E may alter host recognition, reduce efficacy of diagnostic assays and/or avoid vaccine protection. Because several lines of evidence suggest that HBV GT/E is of public health concern, yet we know nothing about the biology of this new genotype or its relationship with the host vaccine response, detection by standard assays, and other HBV genotypes, we proposes to create the necessary HBV GT/E experimental systems and investigate the biology of HBV GT/E in order to assess the risk this new HBV genotype poses to public health. Broadly, we hypothesize that HBV GT/E may have a selective advantage over other HBV genotypes. Specifically, we hypothesize that either consensus sequence differences in the S gene region of HBV GT/E may lead to altered to expression of the HBV S genes, changes in the S proteins that evade vaccine induced antibody recognition or perhaps that it can out compete other HBV genotypes due to more efficient replication and/or spread. To test these hypotheses, we propose 3 specific aims: 1) Elucidate the impact of HBV GT/E S region consensus sequence differences on S protein expression and immunogenicity; 2) Determine whether HBV GT/E replication / infection is more robust that other HBV genotypes;3) Identify the frequency of HBV GT/ E viremia in vaccinated individuals from the West African country Ghana."
"9427332","PROJECT SUMMARY Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever, is a persistent global public health threat that has infected and killed more people than all Ebola outbreaks combined. Unlike Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), Lassa fever is perennial and endemic in West Africa resulting in approximately 300,000 infections and 5,000 deaths each year, principally in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the incidence of Lassa fever is increasing, perhaps as a consequence of climate change, as is the severity and case fatality rate of the disease. As LASV has been imported into non-endemic countries ? with more than 32 cases reported, one third of which were fatal ? the significance of enhanced detection and management of Lassa fever extends beyond West Africa. Many of these deaths could be prevented with better diagnostics, supportive clinical care, and therapeutics. Yet despite being a major cause of death in West Africa, Lassa fever remains under-diagnosed, understudied, and largely ignored. For these reasons, in 2016, the WHO released a research and development blueprint call-to-action, which identified LASV as a ?top priority emerging pathogen? that is likely to cause a severe outbreak in the near future and urgently needs to be studied. Civil unrest coupled with inadequate healthcare and research infrastructure in West Africa have prevented clinical research on this high-priority pathogen, thereby limiting our understanding of the true burden of Lassa fever, the pathogenic mechanisms, and the infectivity of survivors. The primary goal of this proposal is to leverage clinical infrastructure established during the Ebola epidemic to fill critical gaps in our understanding of Lassa fever. Specifically:  ? In AIM I we will establish molecular diagnostics at Phebe Hospital in Bong county, Liberia ? a  hyper-endemic area for Lassa fever to determine the prevalence of acute Lassa fever among  admitted febrile patients as well as the seroprevalance of prior LASV exposure.  ? In AIM II we will probe putative pathogenic mechanisms of acute and convalescent Lassa fever  including immune activation, endothelial dysfunction, and persistence of viral antigens in genital compartments.  ? In AIM III we will characterize the compartmental dynamics of LASV in blood, semen and  cervical-vaginal fluid to determine the duration of viral shedding and assess the infectivity of  PCR-positive samples. We will conduct this work in the context of close and strong working relationships with healthcare leaders in West Africa and a well-developed infrastructure for clinical research we have established in Liberia where we have recruited, enrolled, and longitudinally followed and sampled over 300 Ebola survivors. Establishment of these cohorts allowed our team to determine the feasibility of our approach and develop, pilot, and refine the procedures needed to sustain high-quality data collection during the study of VHFs. This work also allows us to build and support capacity. Our team in Liberia has been trained in research methodology and is being encouraged to develop their own proposals. We have also established a state-of-the-art molecular diagnostic lab and validated a diagnostic platform for the detection of Ebola RNA in blood, semen, and vaginal fluid at Phebe Hospital and have trained this site in quality control. This experience will be applied to the study of Lassa fever. Collectively, the proposed work will provide a much-needed characterization of Lassa fever epidemiology, pathogenesis, and compartmental viral dynamics and will provide a wellspring of data that will inform public policy and individual care. Furthermore, the re-establishment of a Lassa fever center in one of the hardest hit areas will facilitate on-going research to advance the management and prevention of this deadly infectious disease. While much about Lassa fever remains understudied, it is clear that each year this infection will continue to kill more people than all other hemorrhagic viruses combined. What we propose is a series of studies that are long overdue."
"9481685","The annual cost of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the United States is estimated to exceed $1.2 trillion by 2035, with the costs of CVD hospitalizations driving that estimate.[1] Despite this projected growth, many hospitalizations for CVD are potentially preventable if patients receive appropriate and timely ambulatory care. The role that healthcare delivery and payment reform may play in attenuating the expected rise in both the rate of CVD hospitalizations and associated costs is currently unknown. Examples of innovative models of healthcare delivery and payment include the patient centered medical home (PCMH), shared savings accountable care organizations (ACO), meaningful use of electronic medical records (EMR), and the presence of regional health improvement collaboratives (RHIC). These four approaches saw widespread adoption during the last decade. For example, between 2008 and 2014 the number of medical home sites rose nationally from 214 to 6,800. In Ohio, the number of medical home sites rose from zero in 2008 to 520 in 2014.[2] Despite this rapid growth, uncertainty exists about the effect of these four approaches on patient outcomes and cost of care for cardiovascular conditions. For chronic illnesses such as CVD, these approaches demonstrated early successes across a range of disease management indicators such as provider experience,[3] patient experience,[3-5] processes of care,[5, 6] preventive care utilization,[7] and high cost care utilization.[3] Importantly, prior studies of the effects of these paradigms on potentially preventable CVD hospitalization have focused on each approach individually and have not addressed associated costs. Moreover, no prior study has mapped the evolution of the healthcare market penetration of these four approaches. Thus the question of whether and how the growing healthcare market penetration of these four approaches affects the hospitalization rate and costs for CVD remains unanswered. The overall objective of this proposal is to address this question with two specific aims: first, to quantify the healthcare market penetration of patient centered medical homes, shared savings accountable care organizations, regional health improvement collaboratives, and electronic medical records throughout the state of Ohio; second, to model the relationship between changes in the rate of CVD hospitalization and changing healthcare market penetration of each of the four approaches. Successful model development will empower policy makers to make data-driven decisions regarding further implementation and support of integrated models of healthcare delivery and payment transformation that will help improve care quality and reduce costs."

"9414686","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How the sizes of the mitotic spindle and interphase nucleus are regulated within a cell remains largely unknown. This gap in knowledge prevents us from understanding the functional significance of organelle size control, particularly in the context of various cancers in which the scaling relationship between organelle and cell size has gone awry. Our long-term goal is to identify mechanisms of organelle size regulation in order to better understand how organelle size and morphology impact cell function. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular basis of organelle size control. Specifically, we will address the question of how physical constraints imposed by cell-size impact the size, shape, and function of both the mitotic spindle and interphase nucleus. Our central hypothesis is that scaling of nuclear and spindle size with cell size is mediated through a limiting component mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we have developed an innovative experimental platform that utilizes microfluidic-based technology to encapsulate cell-free extracts, allowing us to address previously intractable questions regarding organelle scaling. The rationale for completion of this research is to provide information that can be used to develop more accurate and predictive models of organelle assembly and function, which in turn may lead to new strategies for treatment of cancers and other conditions linked to improper nuclear and spindle function. Aim 1: To determine how cytoplasmic volume regulates nuclear scaling. In this aim we will utilize microfluidics and Xenopus extracts to assemble nuclei in cytoplasmic droplets of defined size, shape, and composition to determine whether changes in cytoplasmic volume are sufficient to account for in vivo nuclear scaling. Aim 2: To identify molecular effectors of mitoti spindle and interphase nuclear scaling using microfluidic encapsulation. In this aim, we will employ microfluidic emulsion/droplet-generating devices to characterize the molecular mechanisms of the scaling relationship between cytoplasmic volume and spindle/nuclear size. Using an unbiased biochemical screen in combination with candidate molecule approaches, we expect to identify components, i.e. scaling factors, whose relative amounts determine spindle/nuclear size. Aim 3: To develop microfluidic droplet manipulation techniques to enable dynamic control over cytoplasm volume and content in four dimensions (geometry and time). This aim will develop microfluidic techniques by which droplet volume or composition may be changed at specified time points to induce and observe dynamic changes in organelle size. Completion of the work proposed in these aims is expected to (i) produce a fundamental advance in our basic understanding of the mechanisms that control the size of the mitotic spindle and nucleus and (ii) demonstrate the tremendous utility and potential of combining microfluidics with an already powerful biological model system, cell-free extracts derived from Xenopus eggs and embryos. This is significant because it will fundamentally advance our knowledge of how the size of the mitotic spindle and nucleus are regulated, providing targets for new therapeutic approaches."
"9558919","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decades, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a range of cognitive processes in an effort to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subtle thought disorder, manifest in disturbance of language production, is a feature that predates rather than follows, psychosis onset in CHR individuals, and therefore may be an indicator of schizophrenia liability. Subtle thought disorder in schizophrenia and its risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. Here, we propose to instead use a novel automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language. It also evaluates syntax through part-of-speech tagging. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture subtle thought disorder and discriminate psychosis outcome among CHR individuals. Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we were able to identify a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort at Columbia, which included semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, shortened phrase length, and decreased use of determiner pronouns (which, what, that). These features were correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in terms of classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. While promising, these automated methods of analysis require validation in a second CHR cohort. In this proposal, in collaboration with IBM, we will validate these automated methods using a large archive of speech data from the UCLA CHR cohort. This dataset has several advantages. First, the UCLA CHR cohort has a high prevalence of psychosis transition, important as machine learning is sensitive to group size. Second, it has undergone prior manual linguistic analysis, identifying features of language production that predicted psychosis outcome; hence, automated and manual methods can be directly compared. Third, there are speech data available from healthy controls and recent-onset psychosis patients (for validation). Fourth, several participants have multiple speech assays (such that stability of the classifier can be examined). Beyond validation of methods, we will maximize group size and combine speech data from Columbia and UCLA to characterize a common classifier of psychosis outcome. Automated methods for language analysis may improve prediction of psychosis onset and inform remediation strategies for its prevention."
"9459874","PROJECT SUMMARY There are very few controlled studies on the oral health of older HIV-infected individuals, especially postmenopausal women. This is of particular concern in the U.S, where more than half of HIV-infected individuals are over age 50. Our group has previously demonstrated that skeletal bone loss at the spine and hip is greater and fracture rates higher in HIV-infected than uninfected women after menopause. Our preliminary data also show that HIV-infected women over age 50 had greater alveolar bone loss and a trend for fewer teeth compared to age-matched uninfected controls. However, the separate and/or combined contribution of HIV infection and estrogen deficiency to oral immune activation and the observed alveolar bone loss is uncertain. Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine the extent and progression of periodontal disease in HIV-infected pre- and postmenopausal women on cART and to investigate the contribution of periodontal immune activation to its pathogenesis. We hypothesize that HIV-infection is associated with increased oral immune activation. Loss of the beneficial immune-modulatory effects of estrogen results in an increased inflammatory response to periodontal pathogens, and greater alveolar bone loss after menopause. In order to examine this, we propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1: To determine the impact of HIV infection and menopause on periodontal health in a cross sectional study 240 HIV-infected and uninfected pre- and post- menopausal women. HIV-infected postmenopausal women will have evidence of worsened clinical periodontal parameters, higher GCF inflammatory biomarkers, greater alveolar bone loss and fewer teeth than uninfected post-menopausal women, and both HIV-infected and uninfected pre-menopausal women. Aim 2: To define the oral immune response in HIV-infected and uninfected postmenopausal women during the induction and resolution of gingival inflammation using the experimental gingivitis model. The clinical, GCF and gingival tissue cytokine response during induction of gingivitis will be greater, and the resolution of the inflammatory response more attenuated in HIV-infected post-menopausal women compared to uninfected postmenopausal women or HIV-infected women on hormone replacement therapy. Aim 3: To delineate the clinical, oral immune, and alveolar bone response to standard-of-care periodontal treatment in HIV-infected and uninfected postmenopausal women with moderate periodontitis. Improvements in clinical periodontal parameters, GCF biomarkers, and alveolar bone density and microarchitecture will be less in HIV-infected than uninfected postmenopausal women with moderate periodontitis in response to oral hygiene instruction, scaling/root planing and periodontal maintenance. If proven correct, these studies provide rationale for investigating use of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), as a safe and testable intervention to prevent periodontal disease progression and/or alveolar bone loss in HIV-infected postmenopausal women."
"9418610","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In animal models phthalates and stress can alter fetal androgens and disrupt androgen-sensitive endpoints. We will examine associations between exposure to phthalates and psychosocial stress at multiple time points in early childhood development and androgen-sensitive reproductive, anthropometric, and neurodevelopmental endpoints. In The Infant Development and the Environment Study (TIDES) we confirmed that first trimester phthalate exposure is significantly and inversely associated with boy's anogenital distance (AGD) and that prenatal stress can modify this association. These novel findings suggest hypotheses that can be addressed with further follow-up of the TIDES cohort during middle childhood. We propose to extend our methodology in several novel directions in order to achieve our overarching goal of identifying the effects of exposure to phthalates and stress on androgen-sensitive development. Children born to TIDES mothers will be invited to two study visits between 3 and 6 years of age. At the 1st visit we will measure height, weight, skin fold thickness, and head circumference, and collect a sample of the child's urine for phthalate measurement. We will assess the child's attention, hyperactivity, social responsiveness, and play behavior by parental report. At the 2nd visit we will repeat these assessments and measure the length of the 2nd and 4th digits and their ratio as well as measuring the child's verbal abilit and visuospatial reasoning by direct assessment. At each visit mothers will complete instruments designed to measure perceived stress, anxiety and depression, job stress and stressful life events. We will create a novel index that transforms the binary classification of se into a gender continuum score and examine its association with pre and postnatal exposure to phthalates and psychosocial stress. We hypothesize that physical measurements (AGD, digit ratio, head circumference) will be sensitive to prenatal exposure, while neurodevelopmental endpoints may be sensitive to both prenatal and postnatal exposure. We hypothesize that AGD will correlate with anthropometric outcomes as well as one or more neurodevelopmental endpoints such as play behavior as our preliminary data suggest. This study could have several implications for public health and environmental policy. Finding robust associations between developmental endpoints and phthalate exposure at current low levels would suggest the need for further reducing exposure. If newborn AGD predicts dimorphic development in multiple domains this would strengthen its importance as a marker of altered androgen-related development. If maternal stress modifies associations between phthalates and dimorphic development, as we have seen with AGD, this would lend support to efforts to reduce stress-related exposures during pregnancy. Any one of these findings from this large, robust, multi- center prospective study would support the hypothesis that a common androgen-dependent mechanism underlies these associations. Our findings could impact future research and policy because our study exposures are ubiquitous and many of our study endpoints, or their correlates, are early predictors of lifelong health."
"9617334","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center was founded as a matrix center within the Duke University School of Medicine in 1972 and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) was created as a new administrative entity within Duke Medicine in October, 2010, with authority and responsibility for all cancer-related activities at Duke University and in the Duke University Health System. The DCI was started with significant investments from Duke Medicine, including a new $243M clinical care outpatient facility, over $60 million of new funds available to support new initiatives, a formula for ongoing investment by the Duke Health System to support ongoing and new DCI initiatives, and additional laboratory and office-based research space. These new commitments were in addition to the clinical space and administrative and Shared Resource lab space already under DCI control and the many laboratories in the Duke School of Medicine and University housing DCI members. The first DCI Executive Director, Michael Kastan, M.D., Ph.D., was hired in August, 2011, followed by major changes in administrative infrastructure, leadership positions and roles, and Cancer Center committees. CCSG Programs and Shared Resources were re-organized, investments were made in high-priority areas, and mechanisms established to more effectively facilitate communication and collaborations among DCI faculty. The DCI, which currently consists of 354 members from 25 departments within 5 schools at Duke University (Medicine, Nursing, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, and Business), promotes collaborations between faculty and staff involved in cancer care, research, and education within both Duke University and the Duke University Health System. It is organized as 9 multi-disciplinary research programs (2 basic discovery, 1 population science, and 6 translational) whose work is supported by 13 Shared Resources (8 lab-based and 5 supporting translational/ clinical/ population research activities). On average, approximately 6000 new cancer patients are seen each year at Duke University Hospital (DUH); during the previous 5 calendar years, an average of approximately 1900 patients per year were enrolled on therapeutic clinical trials at DUH and partner sites, the vast majority of which were at DUH. Almost two-thirds of the DCI therapeutic clinical trials represent early phase research (pilot, phase I, phase II). DCI members are supported by over $242M of external cancer- related grant support, $160M of which is peer-reviewed. DCI grant support includes 51 multi-investigator projects and 91 training and fellowship awards. DCI members published over 8000 papers in peer-reviewed journals during the past funding period, ~39% of which represent collaborative efforts between DCI investigators (12% intra-program, 21% inter-program, and 6% both). The DCI will continue to utilize effective oversight and strategic planning to integrate all cancer-related activities in it purview, from basic research to translational studies to clinical and population investigation to patient care to community outreach to regional/national strategies to global cancer."
"9561587","Abstract  We have long taken for granted to rely on the current HIV recombinant classification system for various aspects of HIV recombination study. However, the central line of this system is flawed in that the viral evolution - an intrinsic feature to HIV - has not been taken into account in the establishment of recombinant families. As a result, each recombinant family defined by the current naming system literally depicts a cross-sectional view of the viral evolution. And in practice, a lack of a dynamic and evolutionary view of virus trajectory would render the design of vaccine and antiviral suboptimal. To address such a flaw in the HIV recombinant classification system, here we propose a novel methodology and research pipeline that will be performed through the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we will determine an actual, up-to-date sequence list of worldwide HIV recombinant strains, which will form the basis for determining HIV recombinant families; and in Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology to integrate viral evolution in clustering recombinant families. Importantly, our proposed methodology does not require prior knowledge of family reference strains, thus avoiding possible bias caused by an inappropriate selection of family references. Given the biological importance of HIV recombination and a growing prevalence of HIV recombinants in both global and regional epidemics, our proposed study is important in that we address a flaw in the recombinant classification system, which sets the basis for genomic-based health care and prevention targeting epidemically important recombinant strains. Our proposed study would be the first of its kind to address such a flaw in the recombinant classification system. We will benefit from our decade- long research in HIV molecular epidemiology and extensive experience with algorithm and analysis program development to perform this proposed study. By the end of this study, we expect to obtain a dynamic vision of individual HIV recombinant families, which would help improve the design of vaccine and antivirals targeting recombinant epidemics. Finally, the novel strategy developed in this study can be easily applied to other viruses that have encountered similar problems in recombinant clustering."
"9408621","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs; cutaneous basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas) are the most common malignancies in humans in the United States. They are the source of considerable morbidity and are a tremendous cost to the health care system. Current methods for their prevention have consisted primarily of sun and tanning bed avoidance and the regular use of sunscreens. Unfortunately, these measures have proven inadequate, and in contrast to most other malignancies, the incidence of NMSCs continues to increase. Two agents that show promise for the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), which inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme, and difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. In other organ systems, these agents have synergistic cancer chemopreventive activities. Because the skin is readily accessible, it may be possible to apply topical formulations of these agents for the chemoprevention of skin cancers without encountering the potential for systemic toxicity. We hypothesize that topical application of the COX inhibitor diclofenac and/or topical DFMO for 9 months is a safe and effective method of reversing biomarkers associated with the development of non-melanoma skin cancers in subjects at risk for their development and will prevent the onset of new actinic keratoses. To test our hypothesis, we plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 100 subjects with a history of basal cell and/or squamous cell skin cancer and at least 8 actinic keratoses. Patients will be randomized to receive: topical DFMO + placebo; placebo + topical diclofenac; topical DFMO + topical diclofenac; placebo + placebo. We will assess whether topical DFMO + topical diclofenac alters skin biomarkers focusing on prostaglandin E2, polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase, proliferation and apoptosis markers (Ki67, PCNA, cyclin D1, caspase 3, tunel assay, Bcl-2, Bax), and molecules in the Akt/ERK1/2 axis. Studies are planned to determine if treatment with topical DFMO and/or topical diclofenac is well-tolerated without signs of significant toxicity. We will also assess whether subjects randomized to topical diclofenac and/or topical DFMO develop over a 9 month period of time fewer new actinic keratoses than those who are placed on placebo. The ultimate goal of these studies will be to determine whether topical diclofenac and/or DFMO should be evaluated in a clinical trial for the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers."
"9444849","Project Summary/Abstract Our knowledge of cochlear mechanics is currently undergoing a revolution. While the basilar membrane (BM) has long been considered the principal structure in cochlear motion, new techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have instead revealed not only that the reticular lamina (RL) moves in a different pattern from the BM, but that it moves 3?10 times more at low input sound levels. Additionally, RL motion is closer to the inner-hair-cell (IHC) stereocilia, making it more relevant than BM motion for triggering the output of the cochlea. The greater motion of the RL compared to the BM also suggests that RL motion may be the main source of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). Another long-held idea ? now realized to be inadequate ? is that the IHC stereocilia are driven only by shearing action between the RL and tectorial membrane (TM). Current evidence suggests that rotation of the RL and oscillatory fluid flow in the sub-tectorial space between the RL and TM also drive IHC stereocilia, and may even be more important than RL?TM shearing. We hypothesize that the stereocilia bundles of the IHCs are stimulated by multiple mechanisms, including classic RL-TM shearing, oscillatory fluid flow in the sub-tectorial space, and tilting of the RL near the IHC bundles; that the relative influence of these mechanisms changes with frequency, sound level, and species; and that OAE generation is dominated by RL motion. To test these hypotheses, a high-resolution OCT system (approx. 3 µm axial resolution) will be used to image and measure motions in the organ of Corti (OoC) in normal-hearing gerbils and mice, and in three mouse varieties with genetic mutations that affect the structure and mechanical properties of the TM. We will measure the transverse and radial motions of the BM, RL, and TM in response to acoustic stimulation at multiple sound levels and multiple cochlear locations. For comparisons to human hearing, responses will be measured from 0.5 to 12 kHz locations in gerbil and from 9 to 20 kHz locations in mouse. To translate the measured OoC motions into a detailed understanding of the mechanisms responsible for IHC and OHC stimulation and stimulus-frequency OAE production, we will use the OCT images to construct 3D cochlea finite-element models for gerbil and each mouse variety, and will test the models against the OCT vibrometry measurements. The models will contain, in a viscous-fluid environment, the key elements of OoC cytoarchitecture sandwiched between the BM and RL, including the pillar cells, three rows of outer hair cells, and IHCs, along with the TM, which together will allow clear relationships to be established between cochlear function and the structure and material composition of the OoC. This will improve our understanding of the various mechanical stages of hearing, will allow the health and structure of the OoC to be correlated with OAEs for diagnostic purposes, and will provide a powerful and efficient modeling framework appropriate for the future development of human cochlear models that can be validated using non-invasive hearing-threshold and OAE measurements."
"9431244","Abstract This proposal will integrate novel cell signaling models of myocyte hypertrophy into organ-level continuum models of ventricular growth, remodeling and mechanoenergetics coupled to hemodynamic models of systemic hypertension. The multi-scale computational models, together with experiments in rats subjected to ventricular hemodynamic overload, will be used to investigate the interactions between anisotropic stretch and neurohormonal signaling pathways in the development of eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis and hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling. Specifically, we will use genome-scale data from pressure-overloaded rat hearts to refine and validate quantitative models of hypertrophic regulatory networks. We will use proteomic and transcriptomic measurements from aortic-banded and sham-operated rat hearts to test and refine quantitative systems models of anisotropic stretch- and neurohormonally- simulated cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in vivo. We will also model and validate tissue- and organ-scale growth and remodeling of the heart due to ventricular pressure overload. We will couple cardiovascular system-models of whole body hemodynamics to three-dimensional continuum models of ventricular growth and remodeling driven by hypertrophic signaling models and cell-scale growth laws. Large-scale data sets from high-field diffusion-tensor magnet resonance imaging in the rat, and constrained mixture models, add detailed information on fiber architecture and material properties. Finally, we will predict mechanoenergetic consequences of ventricular hypertrophy. Models will be extended to include remodeling of contractility and energy metabolism pathways, and used to predict alterations in myocardial mechanoenergetics during pressure overload. These model predictions will then be validated with extensive characterization of in-vivo mechanics (by tagged magnetic resonance imaging) and energetics. These new models will be validated and optimized to help define and analyze specific hypertrophic pathways relevant to translational outcomes in hypertensive patients, with the ultimate potential of identifying new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for hypertensive heart disease."
"9410531","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is predicted to be the most burdensome disease worldwide by the year 2030. Improved understanding of the neural circuits mediating key psychological processes that go awry in the disorder will facilitate development of novel treatments for MDD. Reduced interest in pursuing previously rewarding stimuli (anhedonia) is a core symptom of MDD. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is critical to the pursuit of rewards under normal conditions, and clinical neuroimaging studies suggest this system to be hypoactive in MDD. The unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) animal model has been a useful means to study this phenomenon in rodents. Following UCMS, animals show decreased motivated behavior, which can be restored with DA system excitation. An important question that remains unanswered, however, is why the DA system is functioning improperly in MDD. Our lab has recently shown that the DA system is hypoactive in animals that have undergone UCMS (as well as learned helplessness), due to enhanced afferent inhibition of DA neurons located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We have delineated a circuit whereby increased basolateral amygdala (BLA) drive of the ventral pallidum (VP) following UCMS leads to a potent reduction in VTA DA neuron population activity (number of active DA neurons), and this appears to be critical to the mechanism whereby UCMS reduces DA system tone. However, this circuit presently omits two regions proposed to be important nodes in MDD circuitry in humans: the subgenual cingulate cortex (BA25), whose rodent homologue is the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (ILPFC), and the lateral habenula (LHb). Human studies have shown BA25 to be overactive in MDD, as is also seen for the BLA, and thus a known projection from the ILPFC to the BLA may be driving the BLA over-activation that is critical to diminished DA activity seen following UCMS. Alternatively, the LHb has a more proximal projection to the VTA DA neurons and therefore over- activation of this region may, via the rostromedial tegmentum (RMTg), inhibit VTA DA neurons. We will therefore investigate the relative roles of these two regions in UCMS-induced DA system down-regulation, via the following aims: 1) To determine the impact on the DA system of activating efferent projections from ILPFC- >BLA and LHb->RMTg in normal rats using electrophysiological and behavioral readouts, 2) To assess whether inactivating the ILPFC->BLA or LHb->RMTg projections improves DA system function in animals that exhibit impaired motivation after undergoing UCMS, 3) To define the time course for the development of alterations in regional activity level in potential circuit nodes, including the ILPFC, BLA, LHb, RMTg, VP, and VTA. With greater understanding of the afferent structures potentially down-regulating the DA system in MDD, novel therapeutic interventions could specifically target aberrantly functioning nodes in this neural circuit."
"9417003","Project Summary  Development of the retina begins with the specification of retinal progenitor cells in the anterior neuroectoderm. The first morphological sign of this specification is the formation of two lateral grooves in the anterior neuroectoderm called the optic sulci. The cells of the optic sulci evaginate and form the optic vesicle. The distal portion of the optic vesicle will form the neuroretina and retina pigment epithelium, while the proximal portion will develop into the optic stalk. Our long-term goal is to identify developmental steps and molecular events necessary for the formation of the retina. The primary focus of our research is the role and mechanism of action of the homeobox gene Rx, a gene that appears to be at the top of the vertebrate retina-forming gene network.  Rx encodes a transcription factor and mutations in this gene cause abnormal retinal development in all vertebrates investigated to date. The absence of Rx function leads to the absence of eye formation in mice and humans. We have shown previously that Rx activity is required cell-autonomously for the formation of the neuroretina, retina pigment epithelium and the distal optic stalk. How Rx functions at the molecular level is not yet fully understood. It is not known which proteins interact with Rx and which genes mediate its function. It is the goal of this project to determine the mode of action of Rx during retinal development. To better understand how Rx regulates retinal development and why mutations in this gene lead to such dramatic eye phenotypes, in Specific Aim 1 we will identify proteins that physically interact with Rx during retinal formation using genetically modified mice. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify direct target genes of Rx by chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with sequencing.  This research will lead to a better understanding of retinal development, as this gene regulates the earliest critical steps in retinal formation. Furthermore, since mutations in this gene cause abnormal vertebrate eye development, this research will lead to the better diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the eye in which the components of the Rx regulatory network are mutated."
"9413457","PROJECT SUMMARY Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder associated with a heterogeneous phenotype that includes social, linguistic, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. Anecdotal reports and selected research results suggest that individuals with ASD exhibit difficulties in motor coordination, especially when interacting with dynamic objects, like catching a ball. Yet, these challenges are not included in the diagnostic criteria. Motivated by a theory recently developed by members of this collaborative team, the overarching hypothesis guiding this project is that individuals with ASD have impairment in prediction when interacting with moving objects and events. Using motor skills that involve interaction with a ball as a first test bed for analysis, three sets of experiments aim to quantify predictive impairments. In addition, fast actions such as ball interception require feedforward control, which relies on internal prediction of limb movements. To test predictive impairments three sets of experiments manipulate time for prediction and coordinative challenges. Aim-1 examines naturalistic catching of a ball using 3D motion capture and electromyography to quantify predictive features of the complex task in ASD and neuro-typical children. Manual catching is compared to catching with a funnel that eliminates hand and finger coordination for the catch. Aim-2 examines ball interaction in a virtual set-up that affords controlled manipulation of the time window for prediction, while simplifying the coordination challenges for the hand movement. Confining ball and hand movements to one dimension, tasks will comprise kinematic and dynamic interception of a ball, the latter requiring prediction of the ball trajectory before and after contact. Computationally advanced metrics of hand movements, postural adjustments and eye kinematics relative to the ball will rigorously test the hypothesis of predictive impairment in autism. Aim-3 tests postural control and uni- and bimanual reaching to assess more elementary motor abilities, such as postural sway, reaction, movement time, and smoothness of hand movements. Potential impairments in these elementary movements will be entered as covariates in the statistical analyses. Both the theoretical framework and the rigorous experimental testing are innovative and promote a hypothesis-driven and unifying understanding of the heterogeneous profile of autism spectrum disorder. The investigator team combines Dr. Sternad's long- standing expertise in computational motor neuroscience at Northeastern University with Dr. Sinha's experience in computational neuroscience of visual cognition and autism, supported by Dr. Kjelgaard at Massachusetts General Hospital with long-standing expertise in autism. Given the safety risks to children with ASD acting in a world of dynamically evolving events, searching for the underpinnings of this pervasive impairment holds great significance. Better understanding of the disorder is relevant for making environments not only safer for autistic children and adults, but also for designing early biomarkers and interventions that address the underlying neuro-cognitive issue, i.e. prediction, and not merely the manifestations of the heterogeneous phenotype."
"9374999","Statement of the Problem. Patients and families consistently rate end-of-life communication skills as vital to high- quality care and consistently report deficiencies in the quality of clinician communication around patient goals, values and beliefs. The accrediting bodies for medical schools, graduate medical education, and nursing schools all mandate communication training as a core competency. Thus, many programs have been developed to improve the quality of clinician-patient communication but for the most part they have not improved patient-centered outcomes. This may be in part due to limitations of traditional assessment methods that focus more on the quantity of communication behaviors (ie. whether they occur) without attention to their quality. Experts agree that a better, theory-driven assessment tool that captures the dynamic and complex way that end-of-life communication occurs is needed to improve communication, shared decision-making, and patient-centered outcomes. Specific Aims. This project will adapt a theory-based, validated communication assessment tool, Communication Quality Analysis (CQA), for use in clinician-patient encounters. Currently, CQA relies on transcribed recordings to analyze the conversations, precluding its routine use of CQA for assessing real-time encounters and provision of in-the-moment feedback. The main objectives of this study are to assess whether CQA can be reliably applied to standardized patient (SP) encounters and whether real-time coding CQA scores are comparable to those of the transcript-based CQA methodology. Secondary analyses will compare CQA scores to SP assessments of communication quality. Study Design. Conversations between medical or nursing trainees and SPs (108 conversations) will be video recorded, transcribed and coded by 8 trained coders. Four coders will code transcripts and 4 will code the video recordings without transcripts or pausing/rewinding the video to simulate a live encounter. Inter-rater reliabilities will be analyzed for both coding groups. To determine how well the transcript and real-time coding methods agree with each other, we will invoke generalizability theory by constructing a nonlinear mixed-effects model (accounting for repeated measurements on each trainee, the trainee?s gender, coder, and standardized patient encounter). A similar model will compare CQA scores to SP assessments of the trainees. Significance of the Results. The development of a theory-driven, easily implementable, and reliable communication assessment methodology offers a powerful educational tool to advance trainees? understanding of their communication performance that may improve how they discuss patient goals, values and beliefs. The success of this project will position us to explore: 1) using real-time CQA feedback as a teaching tool; 2) applying CQA to real patient encounters; and 3) using CQA to assess the efficacy of communication trainings on shared decision-making and patient-centered outcomes."
"9615660","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of boundaries between cells and tissues is a critical feature of pattern formation and these same boundaries must be maintained during later adult homeostasis. The mechanisms of boundary establishment and implementation are thus of fundamental biological significance and have profound implications for understanding birth defects as well as cancers, in which boundary constraints are lost, and regeneration, in which boundaries must be formed anew. The goal of this project is to understand the genetic and cellular mechanisms underlying an especially tractable example of boundaries in a post-embryonic vertebrate, the adult pigment stripes of zebrafish. Previous efforts demonstrated that interactions between different classes of pigment cells are essential for stripe development and maintenance, though the particular genes and cell behaviors involved have been elusive. In Aim 1, innovative hypotheses to explain the specification of stripes and their dynamic reiteration will be tested using mutational and transgenic approaches, cell transplantation and analyses of a naturally occurring pattern variant. In Aim 2, efforts will focus on mechanisms of subsequent pat- tern implementation, testing roles for specific cellular behaviors and signaling pathways in refining a striped pattern once it has been established, and how these factors have changed to generate a pattern that lacks stripes. These studies will provide valuable new insights into pigment cell boundary formation, with relevance to human health and development, and promise to shed light on the logic of boundary forming mechanisms more generally."
"9420664","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women in sub-Saharan Africa are at incredibly high risk of HIV infection; 76% of all new infections among young people occur in young women and 77% of HIV positive women globally live in sub-Saharan Africa. Given this, young women have been prioritized as a key population in need of urgent prevention interventions. However, there is a paucity of longitudinal data to understand the multiple levels of social, community, household, and individual factors that shape HIV incidence among young women in sub-Saharan Africa. To date, much of the data on HIV risk in young women has focused on individual-level factors; in particular sexual behavior, has been cross-sectional in nature and often has lacked rich information on social determinants which are key to shaping young women's HIV risk. The overall objective of this application is to determine the effect and mechanisms of effect of key social determinants measured at multiple levels (e.g., individual, household, and community) that influence HIV acquisition in young women in South Africa. In this application, we focus on three under-examined thematic areas which cross-cut multiple levels of influence and that our research and the literature suggest are critical to shaping young women's HIV risk-gender inequity, schooling and socio-economic status, and emotional well-being. Understanding how these determinants shape risk and protection is critical to developing effective interventions to reduce new HIV infection. We have established an ongoing cohort of 2,500 adolescent South African girls, followed through key life transitions into early adulthood; notably this data includes HIV incidence and many key determinants of HIV infection including important life transitions such as coital debut and school completion at multiple time-points. In this application, we propose one additional data collection point as the cohort is entering a period of high HIV incidence. Uniquely, we can link our cohort data with two rich data sets that contain community social environment data as well as population demographic surveillance (census) data. Using the data collected from our longitudinal cohort of young women combined with comprehensive demographic surveillance data and community-level context data, we have a unique opportunity to triangulate and leverage NIH-supported research in order to understand how key social determinants shape HIV risk in young women in South Africa as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood. We also will quantify how intervening on these key social determinants, separately and in combinations, could impact HIV incidence in young women providing critically needed insights for prevention programs targeting this population."
"9394578","Project Summary/Abstract: The Slack gene encodes potassium channels that are abundantly expressed in the central nervous system. These channels are regulated by changes in the intracellular sodium ion concentration. The rapid influx of sodium ions through sodium channels or neurotransmitter receptors results in a sodium-sensitive potassium current (IKNa). Alterations in IKNa due to mutations in Slack channels cause several early onset epileptic encephalopathies. Additionally, epilepsies associated with mutations in Slack channels are associated with a severe delay in cognitive development. The large cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of Slack channel interacts primarily with a protein termed Phactr-1 (Phosphatase and Actin regulator-1) and with the Fragile-X Mental Retardation protein (FMRP). In this proposal, I plan to study how disease-causing mutations modify the association of Slack channels with these binding partners, and how these interactions are linked to changes in neuronal protein translation. The outcome of this study will contribute to our understanding of the regulation of Slack channel activity, and is likely to lead to potential therapies for the devastating condition produced by Slack mutations."
"9424417","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal dissects the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the epigenetic phenomenon of genomic imprinting.

Notably, lncRNAs originating from differentially methylated regions are functionally required for proper monoallelic expression of several imprinted genes. Detailed investigation on lncRNAs in the establishment and maintenance of genomic imprinting will have significant implications for imprinted disorders, such as Angelman syndrome, which results from loss of maternal Ube3a. The paternal copy of Ube3a is intact in patients, but silenced by a neuron-specific repressive lncRNA called Ube3a-ATS. While the mechanism of action is unknown, it has been demonstrated that inhibition of Ube3a-ATS partially restores Ube3a in Angelman syndrome. With more than 100 imprinted protein-coding genes identified to date, a comprehensive study of lncRNAs at imprinted loci will increase our mechanistic understanding of lncRNAs-mediated gene regulation. Here, in Specific Aim 1, an in vitro neuron differentiation system will be established that permits allele-specific transcriptome characterization. Embryonic stem cells from reciprocal crosses of divergent mouse subspecies will be harvested and differentiated to the neuronal lineage. In Specific Aim 2, this unique model system will be used to identify novel lncRNAs at imprinted loci. Transcriptome sequencing and alignment of allele-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms will be used to assign allelic biases in expression. In Specific Aim 3, the molecular mechanisms by which Ube3a-ATS regulates imprinted expression of Ube3a will be determined. CRISPR/Cas9-targeting strategies will be used to functionally dissect the activity of Ube3a-ATS in the epigenetic and transcriptional control of Ube3a in neurons. The long-term goals of this research are to leverage the fundamental activities of imprinted lncRNAs to therapeutically modulate imprinted genes in neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9456334","Project Summary Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than 500,000 deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality rate because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success, and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent, unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates. A vaccine against childhood malaria is a priority because children below the age of 5 years are highly vulnerable to the disease. In recent studies, our laboratory discovered Schizont Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1), a 244-kDa- parasite antigen that is crucial for parasite egress from an infected red blood cell (iRBC), which was published as a comprehensive, full-length Research Article in Science. In a parallel approach, we have screened a phage display cDNA library constructed from parasites isolated at our Tanzanian field site using positive selection with antibodies pooled from resistant two-year-olds and negative selection with antibodies pooled from susceptible children. We identified several independent cDNA clones encoding plant-like calcium-dependent protein kinase (PfCDPK5) that were uniquely recognized by antibodies in resistant, but not susceptible sera. Our preliminary data demonstrate that PfCDPK5 is critical for parasite egress and is expressed by merozoites as they rupture from erythrocytes. Antibodies against CDPK5 block parasite growth in vitro, protect mice from parasitemia, and extend the survival of mice challenged with lethal P. berghei ANKA. Furthermore, PfCDPK5 interacts with other proteins (PfSEA) involved in parasite egress. The proposed work will evaluate the association between naturally acquired anti-PfCDPK5 antibody responses and protection from malaria infection and disease. We will also evaluate the in vivo efficacy of vaccination with rPbCDPK5 in mice and conduct initial optimization studies of adjuvant-antigen formulation using both soluble and particulate forms of the antigen. These studies will form the core supporting data for follow-on vaccine trials in non-human primates with the ultimate goal of a malaria vaccine for humans."
"9238798","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to establish a novel mechanism by which dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) regulates the phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). Transition of SMC from a differentiated phenotype to a dedifferentiated state accompanied by neointima formation/vascular remodeling plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, transplantation arteriopathy, asthma, and cancer. The mechanisms and factors that regulate SMC phenotypic modulation and neointima formation, however, are poorly understood. Under physiological conditions, DOCK2 is only expressed in hematopoietic cells and controls lymphocyte migration and activation by regulating actin cytoskeleton through Rac activation. Our exciting preliminary data demonstrate that platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, a SMC phenotype modulator, induced DOCK2 expression in SMC. Knockdown of DOCK2 blocked PDGF-BB-induced SMC phenotypic modulation, proliferation, and migration. In vivo animal studies showed that DOCK2 was undetectable in SMC of normal rat carotid arteries, but was induced in the media layer SMC initially and neointimal SMC subsequently following balloon catheter-induced vascular injury. Importantly, knockdown of DOCK2 dramatically inhibited the injury- induced neointima formation. The most conclusive evidence for DOCK2-dependent vascular remodeling/ neointima formation was that knockout of DOCK2 (DOCK2-/-) dramatically blocked artery ligation-induced neointima hyperplasia in mouse carotid artery. Interestingly, DOCK2 is localized in both cell membrane and nuclei of SMC, suggesting that in addition to its role in cytoskeleton/cell migration, DOCK2 may be involved in SMC gene transcription. Indeed, DOCK2 overexpression blocked both SMC gene mRNA expression and myocardin-induced activation of smooth muscle ?-actin promoter. Thus, the central hypothesis is that DOCK2 regulates SMC phenotypic modulation by suppressing SMC gene transcription and stimulating SMC migration/ proliferation, leading to neointima formation/vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMC, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) study the molecular mechanisms by which DOCK2 modulates SMC phenotype through regulating SMC gene transcription; 2) investigate if DOCK2 induces SMC migration through activation of Rac/RhoA/ Cdc42; and 3) determine the essential role of DOCK2 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. The completion of this project will unravel a novel mechanism regulating SMC phenotypic modulation and provide novel insights into whether DOCK2 is a potential therapeutic target for countering vascular damage associated with common diseases including diabetes, restenosis, atherosclerosis, and cancer."
"9473411","The period from adolescence to emerging adulthood is characterized by multiple developmental transitions and peak incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Hispanic and African-American women are at high risk for HPV-associated and other sexually transmitted diseases, including cervical cancer and Chlamydia. Subsequent to the approval and release of the quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccine in 2007, we initiated a prospective cohort study of sexually-active, inner-city, minority women (aged 12-19) attending the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC), the largest comprehensive adolescent primary care facility in the U.S. We observed higher rates of HPV infection and associated cervical cytological abnormalities post-vaccination among subjects immunized at age 15 or older who took ?12 months (vs. <12 months) to complete the 3-dose vaccine schedule. Furthermore, we found evidence for increased risk of cervical infection with HPV vaccine types and other STIs among subjects with a history of exposure to psycho-social risk indicators reflecting family disadvantage, psychological distress, and history of childhood abuse/neglect. Last year, the FDA approved a new 9-valent HPV vaccine with a reduced dosing schedule for younger adolescents based on evidence from short term bridging studies of primarily Caucasian and low-risk women with limited numbers of sexual partners. This study will assess the real-world effectiveness of the new vaccine in a high-risk minority population. This unique study cohort also provides opportunities to explore new and innovative areas of research relevant to adolescent health in women, especially with respect to other STIs, and the cervicovaginal microbiome. This is of particular relevance since STI rates are high in this population, with a third acquiring Chlamydia. In addition, we observed that certain types of bacteria found in the cervical specimens from women in our study were associated with increased risks of Chlamydia and HPV infection. Furthermore we hypothesize that the impact of chronic stress and risky behaviors leading to STIs and breakthrough HPV infections may be influenced in part by changes in the cervicovaginal microbiome. To address these health disparities in minority young women, we are proposing to expand our existing cohort and recruit an additional 1108 women with prospective follow-up to age 30 to: 1) determine whether there is a reduction in the incidence of cervical, anal and oral HPV infection and incidence of cervical cytological abnormalities among 9-valent versus quadrivalent HPV vaccinees; 2) study the association between cervicovaginal microbiome and risk of HPV and STIs; and 3) assess the complex associations between psycho-social factors including history of childhood abuse/neglect and risk of HPV and STIs. Data obtained from this study will be essential to understanding the long-term impacts of HPV vaccination in high-risk, minority women not studied in the vaccine trials, and will provide the biological underpinnings for future screening practices, as well as estimating the potential impact of the cervicovaginal microbiome and psycho-social factors on risk of HPV and STIs."
"9499881","ABSTRACT Fungi are ubiquitous colonizers of skin and mucosal surfaces. While many individuals exhibit minor fungal outgrowth, millions of others experience systemic infections with life-threatening consequences. Polymorphisms in numerous genes have been associated with the ability of an individual to generate an inflammatory response to fungal pathogens. In many of these genes, rare high-penetrance alleles have been observed that strongly disrupt gene function, resulting in primary immunodeficiencies and an increase in infectious disease susceptibility. Additionally, common genetic variants have been reported in these genes that increase the risk of disease by modifying the activity or expression of the gene product to a small but significant degree. These genes offer a unique opportunity to understand how immune responses to pathogens are tuned to achieve an appropriate level of immune response. This hypothesis is well illustrated by the various phenotypes associated with different genetic variants of CARD9. CARD9 is a signaling protein that functions downstream of many C- type lectin receptors (CLRs), which recognize carbohydrate moieties on fungi and other pathogens. Understanding how these human disease-related CARD9 mutations affect CARD9 functions will advance our understanding of fungal immunity. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we examine the role of Card9 ubiquitination on fungal detection by dendritic cells. In Aim 2, we will identify the molecular mechanisms controlling Card9 phosphorylation and their consequences for fungal detection. In Aim 3, we compare how Card9 genetic variants affect Candida infection and the development of colitis. Together, these aims will decipher the mechanistic basis of CARD9 regulation and characterize CARD9 genetic variants to identify novel molecular mechanisms with important roles in fungal defense and inflammation."
"9599391","Background: Contextualizing care is the process of adapting care plans to patients' individual needs and circumstances. For instance, a plan to address poorly controlled diabetes is contextualized when it addresses possible barriers to self-care, such as visual problems that create physical barriers to medication self-administration, or competing responsibilities that interfere with scheduled appointments. Conversely, a failure to attend to contextual factors, such as increasing the dosage of insulin rather than addressing the obstacles to adherence when present, is termed a ?contextual error? because it is an inappropriate plan of care that can lead to clinical deterioration and greater health care cost. Identifying contextual errors requires listening to an audio recording of the encounter and coding the audio for specific indicators of context and clinicians' attention to them. Evidence indicates that inattention to patient context is common, adversely impacts health care outcomes, increases costs through overuse and misuse of services, and creates obstacles to patient adherence to care plans. An extensive program of research on contextual errors and how to prevent them has culminated in a VISN 12 funded quality improvement initiative that is based on audit and feedback, in which audio recorded data is collected by Veterans on provider attention to care planning, analyzed and organized using Content Coding for Contextualization of Care (?4C?) system and fed back to PACTs and clinicians to facilitate continuous quality improvement.  Objectives: To identify the most efficient, effective, and acceptable data driven strategy for improving contextualization of care in VHA through an implementation and efficacy study of the expansion of an audit & feedback for contextualizing care intervention package (?package?) in VISN 12. The study will assess the efficacy of the intervention package at two levels of intensity, the effectiveness of implementation strategies, and the potential of the intervention to pay for itself by reducing unnecessary care.  Design: We propose an Effectiveness-Implementation type 2 hybrid design because we have two co-primary aims: optimizing implementation and evaluating the intervention's effectiveness. In addition, we seek to document the costs and cost savings of the intervention package to ascertain its budget impact. The project will utilize the RE-AIM implementation-evaluation framework to assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the intervention. The project will add four additional sites to the two currently engaged in the package, two in VISN 12 and two outside. The rollout of the package will follow a randomized stepped wedge design comparing baseline at the 4 new sites (no intervention) to both a standard and enhanced feedback intervention, with the latter more intensive but more costly.  Analysis: Assessment of efficacy will measure impact on contextualization of care rates, health care outcomes, and costs, the latter through a budget impact analysis. Assessment of implementation will employ survey and focus group methods to identify and address obstacles to implementation, optimizing the extent to which it is perceived as safe, not burdensome, and valuable by clinicians and patients.  Impact: This project takes a decade of research on contextual error and a recent pilot project to prevent them, and applies that work to the refinement and assessment of a strategy for reducing these errors with an approach that may be scalable and transformative for the Veterans' care. By focusing on ?novel strategies to change provider behavior within the context of a learning health care system,? it is a response to the Provider Behavior RFA. It is also aligned with the VHA's new Blueprint for Excellence which seeks, through ?performance improvement?to improve not only the care, but the health and well- being of individuals.?"
"9453146","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lindsay Caverly, MD is a pediatric pulmonologist and scientist at the University of Michigan. This K23 proposal will complete Dr. Caverly's training towards her long-term career goal of improving the health of children with lung diseases through a better understanding of the lung microbial ecology. This proposal will build on Dr. Caverly's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection to provide her with new expertise in clinical research methodology and computational biology. In the proposed project, she will integrate her established and newly-acquired skills to elucidate the role of airway microbiota in the pathogenesis of NTM infection in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). This research and training will be guided by her primary mentor, John J. LiPuma MD, co-mentor Patrick D. Schloss PhD, and an advisory board of accomplished senior scientists with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology, microbial ecology, and biostatistics, and success in mentoring junior physician-scientists. Dr. Caverly's three year plan includes formal coursework to obtain a Master's Degree in Bioinformatics, professional development activities, and progressively independent research. Although NTM pulmonary infections cause significant morbidity and mortality for individuals with CF, the determinants of NTM pulmonary disease, including risk factors for NTM infection and variables impacting disease progression, are largely unknown. The increasing appreciation that CF airways harbor complex microbial communities provides an opportunity to investigate the role of airway microbiota in the pathogenesis of NTM disease. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that changes in the structure and metabolic activities of CF airway microbiota precede and predict NTM infection, while Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that features of the structure and metabolic activities CF airway microbiota predict clinical course after NTM infection. To complete these aims, Dr. Caverly will capitalize on an existing repository of CF sputum samples and linked clinical data. She will also execute a prospective, observational study of individuals with CF to complement the existing samples, gain expertise in clinical research methods, and build a repository of CF sputum samples and clinical data for future studies. Dr. Caverly will use state-of-the art DNA sequencing and metabolomics platforms to characterize the structure and metabolic activities of CF airway microbiota, and will integrate the microbial and clinical data using novel analytic techniques of computational biology to build predictive models of patient-relevant outcomes. Dr. Caverly anticipates that these results will have an important positive impact in informing risk prediction for NTM infection, guiding clinical decision making, and illuminating novel biology. This K23 award will establish a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of airway microbiota in CF and NTM infection, and will equip Dr. Caverly with the skills to be a leader in the field of patient-oriented pediatric pulmonary research."
"9416115","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."
"9560011","Mechanistic understanding of HIV-1 broad neutralizing antibody evolution Recent advances in animal experiments and clinical trials using broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) as prophylactic and therapeutic agents hold a great promise for more effective treatments of HIV/AIDS. In order to make the passive immunization become a real therapy, new bnAbs should be isolated and their activities should be characterized at molecular levels. However, the mechanism underlying the development of bnAbs is largely unknown and there is no vaccination regimen known to elicit bnAb effectively in vivo. BnAbs are developed in a subset of human patients after years of chronic HIV-1 infection, which exhibit great potency and breadth of the neutralizing activities. Up to date, all HIV-1 bnAbs were directly isolated from patients, which is costly, time-consuming, and completely by chance. The goal of this project is to establish an in vitro mutagenesis platform to derive new HIV-1 bnAbs, and to delineate the stepwise accumulations of mutations critical for the bnAb maturation. For most bnAbs, their germline precursors do not bind to native HIV-1 epitopes, or bind very poorly. Finding the proper antigens to stimulate the initial or intermediate precursor B cells remains a daunting task. Without proper stimulation, precursor B cells do not enter the germinal center reaction necessary for acquiring somatic hypermutations (SHM) for affinity maturation. Although the affinity selection process in germinal center is difficult to recapitulate in vitro, several human B cell lines are capable of constitutive or inducible SHM. Therefore, for the purpose of antibody diversification, mutating V regions in a hypermutating human B cell line is as good as in germinal center B cells. It can be envisioned that knock-in of bnAb progenitor genes into a hypermutating human B cell line (Ramos) can give rise to a large pool of mutants from which new bnAbs can be derived. Once this in vitro system is established, we will test two hypotheses: i) bnAbs can be evolved in vitro by mutagenizing their germline or intermediate precursors; ii) the potency and breadth of bnAbs can be further increased by SHM in vitro. The expected outcome of this project is to establish a new method of generating therapeutic bnAbs against HIV-1 (and other viruses), and a new platform for mechanistic study of the evolution of mutations critical for broad neutralizing activities. The Scientific Premise of this project is based on the promising testing results of HIV-1 bnAbs in preclinical and clinical experiments and the extensive studies of SHM in the Ramos cell line."

"9473529","Nucleotide excision repair (NER) protects human cells by removing harmful DNA adducts formed by environmental toxins and solar UV irradiation. Defects in NER in humans lead to the DNA repair disorder xeroderma pigmentosum, which is characterized by high predisposition to skin cancer, neurological abnormalities and premature death. The repair of damaged DNA by NER also has a downside ? it contributes significantly to the development of resistance of tumors to treatment with antitumor agents, in particular cis- and carboplatin, two of the most widely prescribed drugs in oncology. We propose to leverage the combined expertise of the Scharer and Chazin laboratories in chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, structural biology, and small molecule discovery to elucidate how the scaffold protein XPA coordinates the assembly and organization of NER incision complexes. Despite its modest size (273 residues), XPA functions as the central scaffold of NER complexes, interacting with 4 key NER proteins as well as DNA. However, how XPA is recruited to the site of damage and positions other factors through its various interactions remains poorly understood. Moreover, given its essential role in organizing and orchestrating the trajectory of NER complexes, XPA is an attractive potential Achilles Heel to target for suppressing NER. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that TFIIH recruits XPA to sites of UV damage through a proposed interaction interface involving the C-terminal region of XPA and the p8 subunit of TFIIH. We will biochemically and structurally characterize this interaction and determine how mutations in the interface that disturb this interaction affect NER in vitro and in vivo. Abolishing the interaction between XPA and TFIIH will also address the long-standing question of whether the steps following damage recognition are the same for global genome and transcription-coupled NER ? the arrival of TFIIH and XPA is the first step common to both pathways. The action of TFIIH on damaged DNA creates an open ?NER bubble? that provides a landing platform for XPA and RPA and is required for NER incision. The scaffolding function of XPA is reliant on its coordination with RPA, which binds the undamaged strand. Aim 2 will determine the molecular basis and functional implications of the coordinated action of XPA and RPA. Structural, biochemical, and biophysical approaches combined with cellular assays will test the hypothesis that the two interaction sites between XPA and RPA are simultaneously engaged and contribute to NER in a cooperative fashion. Based on these results, our expertise in fragment based molecular discovery will be used to develop and validate initial inhibitors targeting XPA-RPA interfaces. These studies are expected to provide: (i) dramatic new mechanistic insights into the central role of XPA in assembling and coordinating the NER machinery; (ii) the identity of XPA interaction surfaces that are critical to NER; (iii) proof of principle that interfaces between XPA and other NER factors are suitable targets for evaluating the potential of overcoming tumor resistance to DNA damaging therapies by suppressing NER."
"9326402","Abstract The prevalence of sleep disturbances during pregnancy is driven by the normal physiological, physical and hormonal alterations of the pregnancy state. In particular, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), a common sleep disturbance, characterized by habitual snoring during sleep, has been linked to several adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) as well as preterm births. However, these data are generally from cross-sectional studies, with limited control for inherent biases. Of note, near-universal adjustment for the influence of obesity or pregnancy weight gain on SDB often masks its true contribution to PIH. Despite the known complexity of the obesity-SDB relationship, and the increasing public health impact of obesity, the pathway between obesity, SDB and PIH has yet to be investigated with contemporary epidemiologic tools. Therefore, the current study seeks to apply advanced epidemiologic methods to decipher the pathways between SDB, maternal obesity, gestational weight gain and key adverse pregnancy outcomes; PIH and gestational age at birth. In addition, SDB impact on gestational blood pressure trajectory will be examined. In this study, I will pursue the following specific aims: (1) investigate the longitudinal association of SDB and blood pressure, controlling for maternal baseline BMI, gestational weight gain, and other maternal factors; (2) apply mediation analysis to disentangle the complex pathway between obesity, SDB and PIH. I will estimate the total, direct, and indirect effect of obesity on PIH, with SDB as the intervening variable; (3) examine SDB impact on gestational age at birth. The proposed aims will be accomplished using a prospective cohort of 1,673 pregnant women recruited from a large tertiary medical center. Demographic and sleep data, generated by well-validated instruments, were collected from all women, and maternal-perinatal information was abstracted from medical charts. This F32 postdoctoral fellowship will focus on four objectives: 1) didactic education in sleep medicine and research; 2) training in advanced statistical methodology; 3) development of an integrative research track in sleep-epidemiology-perinatology; and 4) growth of professional skills. The proposed training will benefit from a mentoring team with a record of highly productive research in sleep medicine, epidemiology and perinatology. This research will shed light on the role of SDB in adverse maternal-perinatal outcomes. Evidence for the specific impact of SDB, beyond its association with obesity, will provide motivation and rationale to identify `at risk' women among whom early intervention will be most effective. This fellowship will provide comprehensive research, didactic, and professional training necessary to assure development of an independent academic career focused at the critical intersection of sleep medicine, perinatal health, and epidemiology."
"9484333","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed project aims to use genetics to help develop an approach for classifying severe mental illness (SMI) that has a stronger scientific foundation than the systems currently used in both research and clinical practice. These classification systems have, for more than a century, divided the bulk of SMI into dichotomous diagnostic categories: psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia [SCZ]) and mood disorders (including bipolar disorder [BP] and major depressive disorder [MDD]). However the overlap of symptomatology across mood and psychotic disorders, and growing evidence for the genetic correlation between these categories, demonstrate that they imprecisely represent the biological underpinning of SMI. It has been proposed that frameworks based on symptom-level and dimensional (quantitative) information, such as the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), would better reflect the genetic contribution to SMI and would therefore provide a more useful framework for their classification. However the evidence supporting this hypothesis remains sparse, in large part because we lack the right datasets to test it. In this project we will generate a unique SMI dataset, using electronic health records to ascertain individuals who have received inpatient treatment at a single psychiatric hospital that serves the entire 1 million inhabitants of the state of Caldas, Colombia. All of the individuals whom we will investigate are members of the ?Paisa?, a genetically and culturally homogeneous population that comprises the majority in this region of Colombia. By recruiting 8,000 participants across the full range of severe mood and psychotic disorders (as well as 2,000 demographically-matched controls); performing uniform phenotyping of these 10,000 individuals using diagnostic and quantitative assessments; and genome wide genotyping, we will establish dimensional phenotypes that index core deficits of SMI and that reference multiple RDoC domains. We will then conduct genetic analyses of symptom-level and quantitative phenotypes, evaluating their relationship to known SMI loci and to polygenic risk scores (PRS) that represent the overall contribution of common genetic variation to these disorders; the SCZ, BP, and MDD workgroups of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) will provide us with up-to-date genetic data for each diagnosis. Additionally, we will conduct genome wide association analyses of the quantitative traits, including meta-analyses for traits that have been assessed in other study populations. We will also contribute our data (including genotypes available to us for an additional 6,000 Paisa controls) to the case-control meta-analyses of the PGC workgroups, contributing to the diversity of their datasets by adding a substantial number of samples from a previously underrepresented (Hispanic) population. ."
"9443011","PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Many steps of cancer drug development involves the use of standard cancer cell lines (SCCL) which have been instrumental in the development of many targeted therapies; including Herceptin, Gleevac and Tamoxifen among others. However, establishing new CCL that mimic human disease is still challenging due to in vitro clonal selection and loss of the original tumor phenotype. In addition, the efficiency of creating new cell lines is very low. As a result, ~90% of ovarian and breast cancer research has been carried out in 5 CCL each 1, 2. These SCCL and leukemia cell lines do not fully represent the real-life diversity of human disease3-5. Innovation: One of the persistent shortcomings of cell culture technology is the use of full serum, drugs and feeder layers that are partly responsible for the poor replication of the original tumor phenotype. In order to address these problems we developed a series of serum-free tissue specific culture (TSC) media that increases the efficiency of establishing new cell lines to > 50% and retains important tissue specific original tumor features. Preliminary data: We recently published the first application of the TSC technology for ovarian cancer (OvCa), describing 25 new OvCa cell lines that retain molecular, histologic and outcome features of the patient tumors6. Objectives: Our long-term goal is to develop novel TSC media and methods to expand our technology to all tumor types and improve the methods to solve the stromal and normal cell overgrowth problem. Specific Aims: While we work on all tumor types, in this grant we focus on solid tumors (Breast, Ovary) and a liquid tumor (Leukemia) to illustrate that our system can be adapted to culture the full spectrum of tumor types. Aim 1) Characterization of new breast cancer cell lines: We formulated a new normal breast specific and breast cancer specific media, which we will use to establish matching normal and cancer cell lines. Aim 2) Characterization of new acute myeloid leukemia (AML) lines: We formulated a new serum-free medium customized for AML, which we will use to establish new AML cell lines. Aim 3) Culture of sub-optimal samples: Tissue samples with <10% tumor are difficult to culture due to stromal over-growth. We developed a method that suppress stroma to enable culture of sub-optimal tissue samples. Validation of Cancer-Relevant Biospecimen Science Technology: The genome, transcriptome and proteome of each cell line will be compared to the original patient tumor, existing cell lines and tumor datasets. Substantial Improvement and New Capabilities. Our TSC system can maintain cell lines without feeder layers, drugs, extracts, and suppresses the over-growth of stromal and normal cells. Transformative Potential. The biological relevance of SCCL is highly questionable. Hence, it is not surprising that drugs that are developed using SCCL frequently fail in the clinic. Our ability to provide biologically relevant BrCa, OvCa, and AML cell lines can have a transformative effect on cancer drug development."
"9423803","Abstract  Understanding complex comorbid conditions of intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) is an NICHD priority. Severe problem behavior (e.g., self-injurious behavior, aggression) of children with IDD is prevalent, potentially dangerous, and negatively impacts social integration and quality of life. Function-based differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) interventions reduce such behavior effectively, but treatment relapse often occurs when a caregiver does not deliver reinforcement for the alternative behavior. Such relapse is known as resurgence. The efficacy of DRA interventions in reducing severe problem behavior has long been theorized to be related to the same basic processes that govern choice between concurrently available sources of reinforcement. However, quantitative theories of such choice behavior (e.g., the matching law) have not previously been applicable to resurgence following DRA because they could not account for situations in which one or both behaviors no longer produced reinforcement. This project represents a collaboration between a basic scientist/theorist and clinical scientists with expertise in DRA treatments to evaluate and translate the predictions of a novel choice-based theory of resurgence. This innovative theory is built from two fundamental and well-established principles of reinforcement: (a) individuals allocate proportionally more responding to responses that produce proportionally more reinforcement (i.e., the matching law); and (b) the value of reinforcement decreases hyperbolically as it recedes further into the past. By combining these two principles into a mathematical model, the theory accounts for resurgence in situations in which the only existing quantitative theory of resurgence (behavioral momentum theory) has failed. The choice-based theory generates novel predictions about the precise conditions under which resurgence might be expected to occur and how treatments might be altered to reduce resurgence (e.g., extending treatment duration, dynamically adjusting schedule thinning). This project empirically examines these and other novel predictions about variables of high potential clinical relevance, but for which clear data are lacking (e.g., effects of different response efforts for the target and alternative responses) and directly translates insights from the theory and basic research with animals in order to improve treatment of problem behavior in the clinic and reduce treatment relapse. Our overarching hypothesis is that DRA interventions informed by this novel theory will be less susceptible to resurgence of problem behavior: (a) during periods when reinforcers are unavailable; (b) when reinforcer availability diminishes during reinforcement schedule thinning; and (c) when other response or reinforcement parameters change, such as increases in response effort. Thus, this project seeks to fill existing gaps in basic/theoretical knowledge about resurgence and represents a rare close collaboration between basic and clinical scientists to better align basic research and clinical practice."
"9463739","In 2011, 721,800 healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) were reported in the United States. Daily and terminal disinfection of hospital areas such as patient rooms are critically important to help prevent HAI and involve extensive disinfection of the room before a new patient is admitted to the room. Additionally, portable medical equipment (PME) has been implicated in outbreaks of HAIs and the importance of systematic disinfection of PME has been recognized and included in infection control guidelines. Although the Joint Commission requires documentation of disinfection of hospital areas and PME, there is no systematic solution for tracking disinfection methods, location, personnel, and time/date of disinfection. Xenex proposes to beta-test a disinfection tracking system (DTS) based on a patent application licensed from the Veterans' Affairs (VA) Department and Phase I SBIR work, which will have the following capabilities: a display of disinfection status, RFID and sensors to manually or automatically detect a disinfection event, and cloud-based software to analyze disinfection practices. At the conclusion of the proposed project, a fully vetted beta device will have been create and field tested, including studies on the impact of the DTS on microbial contamination as well as user feedback and human factors information. At the completion of this project, we expect to be ready to field test the final design at parter sites and then begin marketing the product. This project will involve systematic observation of disinfection events in an acute care setting with and without the DTS present. The project team will consist of the same sites and PI/co- PIs as the Phase I SBIR. Our long-term goal is to improve patient outcomes through reducing the risk of contaminated surfaces and PME through fully commercializing the DTS."
"9430475","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal examines how a growth factor signaling pathway is linked to synapse structure and function. Growth factors are potent neuromodulators and play diverse roles at synapses. They regulate fundamental features of synaptic biology including baseline transmitter release, synapse morphology, and plasticity. Given their importance directing synapse organization, it is important to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms coupling synaptic growth factor signaling to synapses and neuronal activity. BMP/TGF? family members are evolutionarily conserved regulators of synapse structure and function. In particular, a BMP/TGF? pathway has neurotrophic pathway activity at the Drosophila NMJ. BMP pathway mutants display striking defects in NMJ morphology and function. Remarkably, distinct ligand pools independently regulate these synaptic features. We demonstrate that the presynaptic pool regulates synaptic structure and function, while the postsynaptic pool directs overall growth of the NMJ terminal. Understanding how these information channels are separated at an endogenous synapse is essential to understand how distinct synaptic features are independently controlled. Our entry point to this work is the novel neuronal transmembrane protein Crimpy. We have demonstrated that Crimpy enables discrimination between pre- and postsynaptic BMP pools. Crimpy binds a BMP homolog called Gbb and traffics it to presynaptic dense core vesicles (DCVs). Without Crimpy, Gbb is no longer found in DCVs and is not released by presynaptic activity. In the absence of Crimpy, pre- and postsynaptic ligand pools cannot be distinguished, and the NMJs are characterized by aberrant trophic signaling at the expense of the presynaptic synapse-organizing cue. In this proposal, we build on our novel preliminary findings to define the role of activity-induced presynaptic BMP signaling in synapse structure and function. First, we define the molecular identity of the pre- and postsynaptic signals. Because Crimpy is key for marking the presynaptic pool, we will define biochemically the role of Crimpy in BMP signal transduction. Second, we will elucidate how activity-dependent BMP signals direct synapse organization. We test the hypothesis that the Crimpy-mediated presynaptic Gbb signal is a local and acute cue instructive cue driving synapse organization. And third, we will define the downstream signaling cascade. We have exciting preliminary evidence that a novel BMP receptor transduces the activity-dependent signal. We will establish the receptor's role in the pathway and characterize novel downstream components of a non-canonical activity-dependent BMP cascade."
"9466801","Project Summary/Abstract Symptoms of insomnia and anxiety are common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and detract from quality of life. These symptoms are further exacerbated in the setting of mental health disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD may experience temporary relief from the use of benzodiazepines, these medications pose significant risks. In patients with COPD, benzodiazepine use is associated with a 45% increased risk of exacerbations, and increased risks for respiratory failure and mortality?although our understanding of these risks is incomplete. In patients with PTSD, benzodiazepine use reinforces PTSD symptoms, impairs recovery, and increases the risk of subsequent substance abuse. Given these findings, guidelines have advocated against the routine use of benzodiazepines in patients with either COPD or PTSD, although there may be utility for use in end-of-life symptom palliation. Despite these recommendations, we found that benzodiazepines are used in 35% of patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD in the Veteran's Health Administration (VA). This rate of use is approximately seven times that observed in the general population. We hypothesize that system level factors such as lower center volume, and lower complexity of care provided will be associated with benzodiazepine use after adjustment for patient level factors. Furthermore, as each condition predisposes patients to unique risks related to benzodiazepine use, we hypothesize that the use of benzodiazepines in patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD will result in excess mortality. The current project seeks to test these hypotheses in three aims: 1) identify predictors of chronic benzodiazepine use in a national population of patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD, 2) evaluate mortality risk related to chronic benzodiazepine use in patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD in a propensity-matched cohort, and 3) identify patient and provider perspectives regarding the use of benzodiazepine medications to reduce anxiety and insomnia symptoms in patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD. Knowledge of predictors and perspectives regarding benzodiazepine use gained from accomplishing aims 1 and 3 will inform targets for de-implementation of guideline inconsistent benzodiazepine use, and knowledge gained from aim 2 will help gauge the potential mortality impact of such an intervention. Future efforts aimed at de-implementation will focus on the substitution of alternative agents and education regarding the harms of benzodiazepine use in this setting.  "

"9415392","TITLE: Theranostics of Photoreceptor-RPE-Choroid Neurovascular Unit in Mouse Models of Eye Diseases PI: Robert J. Zawadzki, Ph.D. SUMMARY Inherited and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are currently responsible for serious vision impairment in over 2 million US residents, with prevalence expected to double by 2040 as the population ages. Degeneration occurs in photoreceptor cells, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and in the choroidal vasculature, a complex of tightly interdependent tissues in the posterior eye. This project will investigate in vivo the photoreceptor-RPE-choroid complex in animal models of two macular degenerations, RPE mitochondrial dysfunction model and Doyne Honeycomb Retinal Dystrophy. These models recapitulate two major hallmarks of inherited and age related macular degeneration, degeneration of RPE cells, and age- related increase in extracellular deposits between the RPE and Bruch's membrane, which separates the RPE from the choroidal capillary bed. The project will use innovative, cellular-level resolution in vivo imaging combined with additional functional tests to characterize age-related changes in the structure and function of cells of the photoreceptor-RPE-choroid neurovascular unit (PRC-NVU). These studies will be performed longitudinally in cohorts of mice with the genetic defects, and in wild type controls. The studies will test the hypothesis that the primary defects in RPE-Bruch's membrane cause secondary deterioration of photoreceptors and choriocapillaris vasculature. The studies include measures of photoreceptor structure and electrical activity, bleaching and regeneration of the rod visual pigment rhodopsin, mapping of Bruch's membrane thickness, RPE cell autofluorescence, the redox status of RPE cells, and choriocapillaris vascular morphology and flow. At the termination of the study, the choroid-RPE from one eye of each mouse will be imaged with high resolution ex vivo confocal microscopy; the retina from the second eye of each mouse will be evaluated by conventional histological and biochemical measurements performed on light or electron microscopes, to allow validation of in vivo findings. A novel method for delivering drugs to the RPE via near infrared light-degradable nanoparticles will be used to locally target therapeutic agents to ailing RPE cells, and spatially resolved imaging will be used to determine if the therapeutic agents slow and stop disease progression. By combining longitudinal, in vivo imaging and optical nanotherapies, these studies will lay a foundation for locally targeted drug delivery in human ocular disease."

"9413276","Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury is the main clinical challenge of adverse cardiovascular outcomes after myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery or circulatory arrest. It is well established that myocardial ATP depletion is a key feature of myocardial ischemia and heart failure1. Improving myocardial energy metabolism has been a well- known target to protect the heart from IR injury, but with little success.  ATP synthase is a key enzyme complex generating ATP in mitochondria, thus playing a central role in mitochondrial function. Functional defects of ATP synthase can cause and aggravate human diseases, such as cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. However, our understanding of the regulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrial function in the energy demanding heart remains poor. We have recently identified a PPAR-target gene encoding a novel mitochondrial protein ES1 with unknown function. Preliminary studies revealed that ES1 is a mitochondrial protein interacting with the subunits ? and ? of ATP synthase F1 sector. We were excited to find that ES1 works as an enhancer of ATP production by increasing ATP synthesis and inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. However, it remains unknown if ES1 similarly regulates ATP production in the heart subjected to myocardial IR. Interestingly, our preliminary studies revealed that ES1 protein levels were decreased in hearts with myocardial IR injury of patients and mice. Based on the pilot studies on conditional transgenic and gene targeting mouse lines, we hypothesize that ES1 is a novel therapeutic target of protecting the heart from myocardial IR via its role in facilitating cardiac energy production/reservation. To test this central hypothesis, we will first define the role of ES1 as an endogenous regulator of ATP synthase and as a determinant of mitochondrial structure/function in the heart. We will then determine if transgenic and adenoviral-associated virus-mediated ES1 overexpression in the heart protects the heart against myocardial IR injury by its role in regulating energy metabolism. These studies will provide novel insights into how to manipulate energy metabolism to protect the heart from myocardial IR injury. Furthermore, these new fundamental scientific findings will have broader implications in diseases related to other organs and tissues."
"9543917","Project Summary/Abstract There is substantial interest in using biologics to reduce body and joint pain and to accelerate healing from orthopaedic injuries and surgery1,2. Musculoskeletal problems attributed to injuries and aging are the leading cause of disability in the United States3. In recent years, there has been an exponential rise in the use of biologics to treat orthopaedic problems. This rise is primarily due to widespread use of ?minimally manipulated? autologous therapies such as platelet rich plasma (PRP), that are not required to undergo pre-market approval/clearance from the Food and Drug Administration1. Consequently, clinical use of these treatments has greatly outpaced evidence based research. Concerns over misinformation and patient safety have led to recent calls to action, including one from the American Association for the Advancement of Science5. The orthopaedic professional societies and research communities share these concerns. To address these concerns, Optimizing Clinical Use of Biologics in Orthopaedic Surgery Research Symposium will be a collaborative and interactive meeting to develop a collective impact agenda to promote informed regulation and funding of new pathways for the clinical evaluation of biologics. Specifically, the symposium aims to determine candidate biologic targets for common orthopaedic conditions and injuries, identify a process to determine what is known about the composition and biologic activity of biologics using PRP as a model, determine the feasibility of establishing a clinical registry to collect data on the use of biologics, and identify regulatory pathways to facilitate their use. Symposium faculty and participants will consider clinical trial designs to include use of adaptive clinical trials to test the efficacy of PRP. A combination of didactic talks presented by subject matter experts followed by small group discussions modeled after the NIH/NIAMS Roundtable format will be used to achieve the aims. Symposium participants will be comprised of orthopaedic physicians, the scientific community including NIH and FDA, and young investigators whose research focuses on biologics. The general sessions of the symposium will be open to registrants. The resultant consensus documents, including draft guidance on clinical assessment of biologics that can impact regulatory pathways, are of critical importance to implementing a framework for responsible and evidence based translation of new biologic treatments into clinical use to treat orthopaedic problems. These outcomes serve the public interest and have high potential to positively impact patient care and public health."
"9438534","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary ocular infections are not regularly notifiable to the US Center for Disease Control. Infectious ocular disease epidemics are not regularly reported, tracked, or predicted in the US, despite the fact that tracking would be of clear benefit to the eye health community. We hypothesize that several novel digital surveillance approaches can improve monitoring and detection of ocular disease epidemics, starting with one or the more common model eye infection: conjunctivitis. Severe outbreaks of conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus (epidemic keratoconjunctivitis or EKC) or bacteria occur without warning and sporadically in location and time. Epidemics are highly contagious with a significant burden of cost in the US, although long-term vision impairment is unusual. Risk factors for these and other ocular disease epidemics may be on the rise, and budgetary cuts may further reduce funding for traditional surveillance reporting and prevention. Thus new solutions are needed for monitoring ocular disease epidemics. Recently web searches, social media, and other sourced digital big data has been used to track infectious diseases. Here, we propose (Aim1) to identify candidate ocular disease epidemics using big data through a number of statistical approaches, as well as to (Aim2) use medical records and also develop a digital sentinel network of specialists for participatory surveillance, in order to validate any candidate epidemics, and (Aim3) Since even the health records and other clinical reports in Aim2 are not a perfect gold standard, we will also use a hidden state model to estimate, for each methodology, the sensitivity and specificity (and other appropriate descriptors) of detection of a true conjunctivitis epidemic."

"9573826","Alum is the most widely used adjuvant in acellular vaccines for bacterial pathogens including Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of pertussis or whooping cough. However, it may not be the most effective adjuvant to elicit long-term protection when the mechanism involves Th1-type immune responses, since it skews antibody and T cell responses towards Th2. Since alum activates strong antigen-specific responses and provides protection in the short term, leveraging these properties with an adjuvant that shapes the immune repertoire towards a Th1/Th17-type response may elicit a more protective response that confers life-long immunity.  Despite high vaccine coverage, the incidence of pertussis is increasing in the USA, Europe and other countries. The current acellular pertussis vaccines (aPV) are only partly effective, compared with whole cell vaccines (wPV). However, the reactogenicity of wPV limits its use. We identified an outer membrane protein, Bordetella Colonization Factor A (BcfA), and show that it has adjuvant activity and enhances antibody responses to protein antigens. In an intranasal murine model of B. pertussis infection, we show that addition of BcfA to the aPV induces Th1-skewed antibody responses and provides better protection against infection. We hypothesize that the combined activity of alum and BcfA will result in synergistic enhancement of protective immune responses in mice against B. pertussis.  In Specific Aim 1, we will test the signaling pathways activated by BcfA, alone and together with alum. We hypothesize that combination treatment with these adjuvants will reshape the profile of activated cytokines produced by inflammatory cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how combined immunization with BcfA and alum alters the phenotype of antibody and T cell responses to B. pertussis antigens. In Specific Aim 3, we hypothesize that the Th1/Th17 skewed immune responses induced by the combination of alum and BcfA will result in better clearance of a B. pertussis challenge, and long-lived immunologic memory. This hypothesis will be tested by determining the effect of combined alum/BcfA immunization on B. pertussis clearance from the murine respiratory tract. IMPACT: We have identified a novel adjuvant, BcfA, and hypothesize that the potent responses induced by alum will be shaped to a Th1 type response by BcfA thereby providing better protection against B. pertussis infection. This adjuvant combination may be applicable to other diseases where Th1 type immunity is important for protection."
"9471153","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Cancer Epigenetics: New Mechanisms, New Therapies, organized by Drs. François Fuks and Anne Brunet. The conference will be held February 10- 14, 2018 in Breckenridge, Colorado. The field of epigenetics has recently emerged as an essential component of oncology research, with altered epigenetic modifications considered to be critical hallmarks of cancers. Unlike mutations, epigenetic aberrations are reversible and as a result, epigenetic therapies hold great promise as anti-cancer agents. For these novel therapies to succeed, a key challenge is to fully understand the nature and the mechanisms that lead to epigenetic changes in cancer. Another essential challenge is to make sense of the avalanche of data flowing from increasingly powerful omics-based technologies. Despite these challenges, never has the potential for scientific and clinical breakthroughs in this field been greater. Bringing together both the academic and the pharmaceutical communities, this Keystone Symposia meeting will focus on: 1) The newest findings on the mechanisms by which epigenetic pathways are established and maintained in normal and stem cells, and how these go awry during aging and cancer, with a special emphasis on histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and the unexpected increased number of DNA modifications ((hydroxy)methylcytosine and methyladenine); 2) The growing roles of noncoding RNAs in cancer and the emergence of the new and exciting realm of RNA epigenetics; 3) Use of new omics technologies to interrogate altered epigenetic landscapes in tumors and assess their clinical implications; and 4) Novel and promising therapeutic drugs aimed at reversing specific epigenetic alterations. Ultimately, the meeting will provide great opportunities for senior and junior scientists to meet the leaders in the field from both academia and industry, hence forging exciting interdisciplinary interactions and creating potential new collaborations in the booming area of cancer epigenetics."
"9470635","PROJECT SUMMARY    Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of lung cancer, with a median survival of 24  months and a five-­year overall survival of 7%. Cisplatin-­based chemotherapy is the first-­line treatment for SCLC,  functioning  by  creating  DNA  crosslinks  leading  to  cancer  cell  death.  While  initially  effective,  many  patients  ultimately develop cisplatin resistance and experience tumor recurrence. The DNA damage response (DDR) is  a signaling network that recognizes challenges to genome integrity and coordinates diverse DNA repair and cell  cycle  checkpoint  pathways.  Targeting  DDR  proteins  critical  to  the  cellular  response  to  cisplatin  in  SCLC  may  overcome  acquired  cisplatin  resistance,  but  the  cellular  response  to  cisplatin  remains  unclear  because  many  proteins  that  respond  to  cisplatin-­induced  DNA  damage  have  yet  to  be  identified.  To  address  this  issue,  a  synthetic lethal screen using a custom siRNA library of 1008 nuclear enzymes was performed in H128 cisplatin-­ resistant SCLC cells to identify genes critical for mediating cisplatin resistance. Enhancer Of Zeste 2 Polycomb  Repressive  Complex  2  Subunit  (EZH2),  a  H3  K27  methyltransferase,  was  identified  as  one  of  the  strongest  synthetic lethal hits in the screen, where knockdown of EZH2 strongly sensitized H128 cells to cisplatin.   EZH2 is overexpressed in SCLC as well as other cancers and has been implicated in cancer progression.  Moreover, EZH2 inhibitors have shown efficacy in several cancers, including SCLC;? however, the the molecular  underpinnings  of  the  efficacy  of  EZH2  depletion  or  inhibition  in  SCLC  and  the  mechanistic  role  of  EZH2  in  mediating cisplatin resistance in SCLC are unclear. In this regard, I validated that EZH2 depletion in cisplatin-­ resistant H128 and H146 SCLC cell lines results in cisplatin hypersensitivity, and furthermore found that EZH2  localizes to DNA damage sites induced by laser microirradiation, suggesting that EZH2 may function directly in  mediating  DNA  damage  resistance  in  SCLC.  In  addition,  using  mass  spectrometry  analysis  of  purified  EZH2  from cells, I identified a novel interaction between EZH2 and DNA Damage-­Binding Protein 1 (DDB1), an E3  ubiquitin ligase component that promotes nucleotide excision repair (NER) of cisplatin-­induced DNA intrastrand  crosslinks, which I validated by co-­immunoprecipitation. As such, I hypothesize that EZH2 plays a critical role in  mediating cisplatin resistance in SCLC by promoting DNA damage response (DDR) activities and furthermore  that EZH2 inhibition will sensitize resistant SCLC cells and tumors with dysregulated DDR pathways to cisplatin  treatment. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism by which EZH2 mediates cisplatin resistance in SCLC. Aim 2 will  determine  if  EZH2  inhibition  sensitizes  resistant  SCLC  cells  and  tumors  with  dysregulated  DDR  protein  expression to cisplatin treatment in vitro and in vivo. Completion of these aims will define a novel role for EZH2  in  the  DDR  in  mediating  cisplatin  resistance  in  SCLC  and  elucidate  the  effectiveness  and  specific  biological  context  for  which  EZH2  can  function  as  a  novel  therapeutic  target  for  improving  the  efficacy  of  treatment  for  patients with SCLC who fail initial treatment.  "
"9618779","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases account for 40% of death in United States. Vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis involve extensive vascular remodeling such as cell proliferation and migration in neointima. Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are a major cell type in the tunica media of vascular wall, and it is generally accepted that mature SMCs can de-differentiate into proliferative/synthetic phenotype during vascular remodeling. However, there is a lack of direct evidence that characterize the de-differentiation of mature SMCs in vitro and in vivo, and the relative contribution of SMCs and vascular stem cells to disease development has not been well elucidated. Here we aim to address this knowledge gap. Recently, we have identified a novel type of multipotent vascular stem cells (MVSCs) in the wall of blood vessels. MVSCs express transcriptional markers such as Sox10 and Sox17, and can differentiate into both proliferative/synthetic and mature SMCs. In addition, MVSCs can differentiate into several mesenchymal (chondrogenic, adipogenic and osteogenic) and neural (peripheral neuron and Schwann cell) lineages. By using DNA microarray analysis, we have also identified a potential MVSC surface marker that may regulate MVSC proliferation and migration. Furthermore, by using lineage tracing and biochemical analysis, we have shown that MVSCs outgrow SMCs in culture and that MVSCs become proliferative following vascular injury and contribute to neointima formation. Finally, we have isolated and characterized MVSCs from human atherosclerotic plaques, coronary artery, aorta and femoral artery. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that MVSC differentiation is a major source of proliferative/synthetic SMCs and contributes to neointima formation. To test our hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed: (1) Characterize MVSC markers and the relative contribution of MVSCs and mature SMCs to proliferative/synthetic SMCs in vitro by using lineage tracing models; (2) Determine the roles of MVSCs and mature SMCs in neointima formation following vascular injury in transgenic mouse models; (3) Characterize MVSCs in human arteries and atherosclerotic lesions. If accomplished, this work will break new grounds in vascular biology, and demonstrate the important role of MVSC differentiation in vascular remodeling and disease development. This work will also provide insight into the mechanisms of vascular remodeling and lead to the development of novel therapies for vascular diseases by using MVSC as a therapeutic target."
"9418535","Project Summary Latinos in the United States face health disparities for obesity and related medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Targeting families to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors has been identified as an effective strategy to prevent obesity. With the importance of familism (family cohesion) among Latino population, a family based intervention is especially desirable as an engaging strategy to promote behaviors that support a healthy weight status and decrease obesity related health disparities for Latinos. Emerging evidence supports the need to include and target fathers in family based lifestyle behavior interventions. However, to date primarily mothers have been reached by such efforts in the US. Health Dads Healthy Kids (HDHK) is an evidence based program developed in Australia, shown to have significant weight and behavior treatment effects for fathers and their children, compared to controls. The HDHK program is based on Social Cognitive Theory and Family Systems Theory and aims to promote increased physical activity and improved dietary intake. An important innovation in the program is that fathers and children attend together and are both targeted as agents of behavior change for each other (reciprocal reinforcement) and to participate in fun, family activities together. HDHK has several features that may appeal to Latino families: it is delivered in group sessions by a trained facilitator from the community (collectivism), and it promotes paternal role- modeling (enforces respeto), family cohesion, and engagement together in lifestyle behaviors (familism). How- ever, HDHK should be systematically culturally adapted for Latino families to ensure appropriate enrollment, engagement and promotion of desired health outcomes for Latino families, prior to further evaluation. We propose to convene a panel of Latino fathers and mothers from the community to serve as key informants; and an expert panel of researchers with experience in culturally adapting parenting interventions for Latinos, Latino lifestyle behaviors, and the influence of Latino fathers. The two panels will work with the study team (including the developer of HDHK) to systematically modify the HDHK program to culturally adapt it for Latino families following the Ecological Validity Model. They will also inform the selection of items from established item banks of food and physical activity parenting. The resulting scales will be tested among a sample of Latino fathers to establish validated scales of parenting for Latino fathers, which is expected to be a mediator of children's behavior change in HDHK, and will be needed in the future trial. The resulting Latino-HDHK will be tested for feasibility (as measured by retention, engagement, and satisfaction), in a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=40). The pilot study will include a thorough process evaluation, including exit interviews with participating Latino fathers and their co-parent (typically mothers). Once completed, this developmental study will position us to apply for a future R01 to assess the Latino-HDHK in a fully powered randomized controlled trial."
"9414615","TR&D3 PROJECT SUMMARY  Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are  naturally occurring polydisperse linear polysaccharides that are heavily O- and N-sulfated. The interaction  between GAGs and proteins are critical for many biological processes including cell-cell and cell-matrix  interactions, cell migration and proliferation, growth factor sequestration, chemokine and cytokine activation,  microbial recognition and tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. Hundreds of HS-binding  proteins have been identified, but the oligosaccharide structures that mediate particular interactions have been  defined in only a few cases due to the structural complexity of HS. Studies in Technology Research and  Development project 3 (TR&D3) are focused on biochemical and genetic approaches to assess  proteoglycan (PG) functions through the use of cell-based systems for recombinant target protein and PG  expression, biochemical characterization, and cell-based assays for biological function. The technologies are  based on platforms for large-scale recombinant PG binding protein expression in mammalian cells for  enrichment of GAG ligand structures in TR&D1, structural studies in TR&D2, and for cell-based assays in  TR&D3. Interactions with PGs in vivo can be more complex, since natural GAGs are much larger than simple  oligosaccharides; they may interact simultaneously with both ligands and their receptors via distinct binding  sites, and may also harbor multiple copies of these binding sites. Recombinant production of secreted PGs  containing engineered GAG chains for use in biochemical and structural studies and cell-based assays are  proposed to extend and validate biochemical findings in a cellular context. Mouse lung endothelial cell (MLEC)  lines are being developed harboring gene disruptions in selected steps in heparin sulfate (HS) biosynthesis or  modification for structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to examine cell-based functions of PG core  proteins harboring altered GAG chains. Specific Aims are proposed to: Aim 1.

"9438574","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a multisystem disorder caused by defective telomere maintenance. Bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis, solid tumors, and liver disease are life-threatening manifestations of DC. The goal of our research is to understand the molecular genetics of DC, thereby opening avenues for targeted interventions that may be relevant not only to DC but also to other conditions associated with telomere shortening. Mutations in TINF2, which encodes the telomeric shelterin complex component, TIN2, are causes of DC. An outstanding question is why heterozygous and de novo mutations in TINF2 result in extreme telomere shortening and severe, early-onset disease whereas heterozygous mutations in telomerase component genes lead to more severe manifestations of disease and progressively earlier onset disease over generations in kindred's. All DC-associated TINF2 mutations reported to date, whether missense or truncating, cluster in a 34-amino acid segment located centrally within both the short (TIN2S1-354) and long (TIN2L1-451) TIN2 isoforms. Our research focuses on the unstudied TIN2L isoform, which either harbors missense mutations within the DC cluster or is not expressed when truncating mutations are present. Our preliminary data indicate that TIN2L and TIN2S are not equivalent components of shelterin and that the most common DC-associated missense mutation has deleterious effects on TIN2L but not TIN2S. Additionally, we found that TIN2L contains a conserved phosphorylation site that, when mutated, has the same functional effect on TIN2L as mutations within the DC cluster. Lastly, we found that the enhanced interaction between TIN2L and TRF2 requires TRF2-F120, a key residue within the TRF homology (TRFH) domain that serves as a docking site for various DNA-processing and DNA damage response factors. We hypothesize that TIN2L regulates the ability of TRFH domain-interacting proteins to access TRF2 and that altered TIN2L activity and enhanced recruitment of TIN2L to telomeres drives telomere shortening in patients. In Specific Aim (SA) 1 of this proposal, we will determine the relative impacts of TIN2S and TIN2L on telomere structure and function by generating an allelic series of mutant cell lines and performing complementation tests with patient-derived TINF2 mutant cell lines. We will also determine if TIN2L, compared to TIN2S, differentially interacts with other proteins in addition to TRF2 using a novel immunoprecipitation protocol followed by mass spectrometry sequencing methods. Finally, we will screen genetically uncharacterized patients with very short telomeres for specific mutations in TIN2L. In SA2, we will elucidate the function of TIN2L phosphorylation by identifying its impact on TRF2 binding and clarifying its relationship with the DC cluster through an array of in vitro and in vivo analyses. In SA3, we will determine the functional interplay between TIN2L and TRF2 TRFH domain- interacting proteins and identify how they are altered in TINF2 mutant cell lines. This work is expected to not only shed light on DC pathogenesis but also generate new paradigm shifts in telomere biology."
"9417604","RESOURCE PROJECT - PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of ENCORE (Encyclopedia of RNA Elements) is to provide protein-RNA interaction maps for 300 RBPs in 2 human cell lines, and associated localization, binding motif and functional datasets that aid in interpretation of these data and assigning functions to the bulk of these RBPs. The goal of this resource project is to generate and validate stable cell lines expressing epitope-tagged RNA binding proteins, perform primary and integrated analysis of the human RBP physical and functional interaction data, and to develop publicly- accessible transcriptomic, binding affinity and subcellular localization databases. These three goals are critical to maximizing the impact of this resource by providing not only valuable physical resources to the community (e.g. tagged cell lines) but also integrated analysis of the data to obtain as much insight as possible into the functional and binding properties of each RBP. More importantly, making this data as accessible as possible to a broad community of scientists will be achieved by making all data available at public data portals such as the ENCODE DCC, as well as via our own web portals that host the datasets in formats amenable for web-based queries and focused browsing. We will also conduct training sessions in the use of these tools. Finally, we will facilitate reproducible data analysis by making all code we develop available using common workflow language that can be used on any compute server and platform."
"9460561","Project Summary/ Abstract The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are both critical for learning and memory-guided behavior, with the hippocampus necessary for rapid episodic learning and memory, and PFC playing an integral role in long- term memory, retrieval, working memory and decision making. Coordination of neural activity between these regions is necessary for these cognitive processes, however, it is still unclear what features of neural activity mediate interactions for communication of memory-related information, and the explicit roles of these activity patterns in learning, retrieval and decision making. This proposal will investigate the roles of prominent physiological network patterns by combining behavioral methods in rats, high-density recording, and a novel closed-loop optogenetic perturbation technique that can detect network patterns in real-time and disrupt inter- regional coordination. First, we will simultaneously and continuously monitor activity of neural populations in the hippocampus and PFC over the course of learning of a novel spatial memory task. Previous work suggests that two prominent patterns can mediate hippocampal-prefrontal interactions; coherence during theta oscillations associated with place cell activity, and coordinated reactivation of behavioral experiences during awake sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). We will test if awake SWR reactivation during initial exploration supports memory formation by establishing associations between hippocampal-prefrontal neurons, and if theta coherence mediates retrieval of these associations during later exploitation to support ongoing decision making. Next we will use real-time detection and closed-loop optogenetic perturbation to disrupt coordination during specific physiological patterns. We will test if disrupting coordinated reactivation using optogenetic perturbation of prefrontal reactivation during awake hippocampal SWRs impairs memory formation and behavioral learning. Further, we will test if disrupting phase-locked prefrontal spiking during theta coherence impairs retrieval and memory-guided decision making. Finally, we will investigate if reactivation during sleep and awake SWRs play different roles in learning. We will examine differences in prefrontal reactivation for awake vs. sleep SWRs, and test the causal role of sleep SWRs in consolidation by disrupting prefrontal reactivation during sleep. Together, these aims will provide an integrated, causal understanding of the role of prominent network activity patterns in hippocampal-prefrontal interactions necessary for learning and memory- guided behavior. This proposal will thus provide crucial insight into memory disorders associated with these regions such as dementia, PTSD, Alzhiemer's disease, and also neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia."
"9559872","Monoclonal antibody for autoimmune disease Abstract  B cells play a major role in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis, and type I diabetes mellitus (T1D), as indicated by the efficacy of B cell?targeted therapies, e.g. rituximab, in these diseases. Unfortunately, current therapies are predicated on B-cell depletion, which is problematic from a safety standpoint. Due to consequent immunosuppression, existing standard-of-care therapies generate adverse effects, notably opportunistic infections and activation of viruses from latency, due to long-term, severe B cell depletion. Recently, an alternative approach involving the targeting of CD79, the transducer subunit of the B cell receptor (BCR) has been suggested by our group. Unlike anti-CD20 mAbs, the protective effects of CD79-targeted mAbs do not require cell depletion; rather, they act by inducing a reversible unresponsive or anergic state, and thus do not participate in immune response generation. In the murine MRL/lpr model of SLE, anti-CD79 antibodies were potently immunosuppressive and effective at decreasing inflammation and improving survival (Li, 2008). In a collagen-induced arthritis model of rheumatoid arthritis, anti-CD79 antibodies delayed the onset of arthritis and decreased arthritis scores by inducing anergy with transient, reversible B cell redistribution (Hardy, 2014). Based on these studies, Phase 1 work identified and characterized a potent humanized monoclonal anti- human CD79 antibody. The activity of the antibody does not require ADCC, complement fixation, but rather acts by induction of a transient and reversible state of polyclonal B cell anergy. During this Phase II project, we will expand preclinical studies in a transgenic mouse model expressing huCD79 and in a NOD mouse model of T1D. In addition, we will explore the molecular basis of unresponsiveness and analyze toxicity, and pharmacokinetics, as well as activity in non-human primates. We expect this second generation immunosuppressive therapeutic to be significantly safer than existing B cell-targeted antibodies for T1D and potentially other autoimmune diseases. 1 R43 AI120433-01"
"9614012","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Graft-versus-host  disease  (GVHD)  is  the  leading  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  following  allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation,  an  established  therapy  for  patients  with  hematological  malignancies.   Current  strategies  to  diminish  GVHD  include  T-cell  depletion  and  immunosuppressive  drugs,  which  are  associated with an increased risk of tumor relapse, opportunistic infection, and/or toxicity.  Novel approaches acting intrinsically on the immune system are clearly needed.  Myeloid-derived  suppressor  cells  (MDSCs)  consist  of  a  population  of  myeloid  precursor  cells  that  exhibit  potent  suppressive  activities  capable  of  dampening anti-tumor responses, autoimmunity, and allo-responses in graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD) and  organ transplantation. Our preliminary results indicate that MDSCs have several attractive attributes as helper  cells  to  inhibit  GVHD  without  significantly  compromising  graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma  (GVL)  in  a  murine  model,  resulting  in  the  establishment  of  long-term  survival.  Recently,  we  also  demonstrated  that  MDSCs  acquire M1 or M2 functional macrophage phenotypes through regulation of PIR-B (paired immunoblobulin-like  receptor  B  and  human  counterpart  inhibitory  immunoglobulin-like  receptors  B,  LILRBs)  signaling,  which  may  facilitate  the  development  of  antitumor  responses  or  mediate  immune  suppression  and  Treg  activation,  respectively. The objective of this proposal is to understand the mechanism by which MDSC biological function  is  regulated  and  to  devise  an  optimized  protocol  for  directing  the  functional  activities  of  MDSC  toward  suppression  of  GVHD  while  allowing  sufficient  GVL  activity  to  eradicate  tumors.  Based  on  the  results  of  ou  preliminary studies, we hypothesize that: (i) The functional phenotype of MDSC can be modulated by PIR-BL  ligation and (ii) The presence of MDSCs with a persistent M2 functional phenotype may be sufficient to prevent  GHVD  and  retain  GVL  ability.  Three specific aims will be pursued:  Aim 1.  Study the regulation of MDSC function and the associated effects on GVHD. Aim 2. Study the effects of PIR-B ligation on MDSC as related to  inhibition  of  GVHD  and  the  corresponding  signaling  regulation  in  an  irradiated  host.  Aim 3.  Study  the  mechanism and effects of MDSC mediated regulation of GVHD vs. GVL through PIR-B/LILRB engagement in  mouse  GVHD  models  and  in  a  human  xenograft  NSG  mouse  model.  The proposed studies will provide the basis and scientific principles for future clinical translation."
"9438415","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress plays a critical role in emotional memory formation. The emotional content of an experience often dictates which elements of the experience are remembered, and an important site in the brain for the formation of these emotional memories is the amygdala, particularly the basal lateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). The formation of emotional memories is caused by changes in the neural signaling in the BLA, and fear memory formation is characterized by the potentiation of excitatory synaptic circuits impacting the principal output neurons of the BLA. One means by which excitatory synaptic circuits in the BLA can be potentiated is by depressing inhibitory synaptic circuits, which leads to an increase in the excitability of the BLA neurons and a lower threshold for the long-term potentiation (LTP) of BLA excitatory circuits. Thus, the long-term depression of synaptic inhibition (LTDi) in the BLA promotes the LTP of excitatory circuits, which should increase anxiogenic output from the BLA to downstream target structures, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal neuroendocrine stress axis. Stress and the stress-induced increase in circulating glucocorticoids facilitate the anxiogenic output from the BLA, and this is mediated by intra-BLA endocannabinoid- and norepinephrine- dependent mechanisms. We have compelling preliminary evidence from patch-clamp recordings in brain slices for the induction by acute restraint stress of a form of LTDi that is mediated by rapid glucocorticoid-induced endocannabinoid depression of inhibitory transmission in the BLA. This represents, therefore, a form of stress and glucocorticoid-induced LTDi in the BLA. In this proposed project, we will distinguish the glucocorticoid and endocannabinoid mechanisms responsible for this stress-induced LTDi using pharmacological and genetic approaches, and we will determine whether stress-induced LTDi elicits anxiogenic behavior and facilitates fear memory formation by promoting LTP at excitatory synaptic circuits in the BLA. We will determine the noradrenergic mechanisms involved in the stress and glucocorticoid facilitation of anxiogenesis and fear memory formation. These studies will culminate in a fundamental understanding at the cellular level of how stress facilitates anxiogenesis and fear memory formation by inducing synaptic plasticity of inhibitory circuits in the BLA, and will provide possible cellular and molecular targts for future therapeutic intervention for the prevention and/or treatment of anxiety disorders. A potentially invaluable finding that may emerge from these studies is the identification of cannabinoid and/or noradrenergic pharmaceutical targets for the prevention of fear memory formation following exposure to trauma, when therapeutic intervention is feasible."
"9546195","Abstract Malaria remains a great public health challenge that has resisted world-wide control efforts. The malaria parasite's intracellular life-cycle inside red blood cells (RBC) and its ability for antigenic variation have thwarted vaccine development. Immunity to malaria is short-lived and requires constant exposure to the parasite. Naturally acquired immunity is gained by residents in malaria endemic areas, which protects them from severe malaria and reduces the risk of reinfection. All adaptive arms of the immune system, namely T and B cells can contribute to clinical immunity against different stages of the parasite cycle, both in humans and in mouse models of malaria. Passive transfer of serum from clinically immune individual can protect susceptible patients, establishing the importance to antibody responses in protection. Yet, how protective antibody responses are achieved is unknown. Current vaccines against the deadliest form of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), are only partially protective and confer only limited protection over time. This proposal builds on the study of a cohort of African patients that allowed us to capture varied levels of clinical immunity. Using high throughput unsupervised analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma from clinically protected versus susceptible patients, we discovered the presence of an expanded subset of memory CD4+ T cells. Frequencies of these cells also correlated with higher plasma parasite-specific opsonizing Abs. We hypothesize that the memory CD4+ T cells are essential for long-lived immunity against malaria by promoting optimal protective Ab responses. The current proposal will explore the functional attributes of these memory CD4+ T cells and establish the characteristics of these highly protective Abs that develop in clinically protected patients."
"9561699","Dr. Rajasingham is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases & International Medicine at the University of Minnesota. Her long-term goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of innovative diagnostics and therapeutics related to the prevention and management of AIDS-related opportunistic infections. She is particularly interested in using cost-effectiveness analysis alongside clinical trials, in order to translate effective interventions into policy.  Training: This K23 award will provide the mentored clinical research experience and didactic training in decision analysis and simulation modeling necessary to establish her independent research career. With the mentorship of an interdisciplinary team with expertise in decision analysis, biostatistics, and HIV international clinical trials, she will: 1) acquire advanced training in decision analysis and simulation modeling, 2) acquire expertise in HIV international clinical research methodology, and 3) develop multidisciplinary collaborative and networking skills.  Research: Cryptococcus is a leading cause of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) can be detected in the blood weeks to months prior to the onset of meningitis and is an independent predictor of mortality. A public health strategy to reduce mortality is to screen for CRAG in the plasma of people entering HIV care with a CD4 count <100 cells/mcL. Those who are asymptomatic CRAG+ can be treated preemptively with fluconazole antifungal therapy to prevent meningitis or death while receiving HIV therapy. Despite the survival benefit associated with this WHO-recommended CRAG screening and treatment strategy, ~30% of asymptomatic CRAG+ persons die despite standard of care treatment with fluconazole. Those with high CRAG titers (>1:160) are 3 times more likely to die than are those with low CRAG titers (<1:80) in blood. I hypothesize that customized antifungal therapy based on CRAG titers will improve survival, whereby patients with high titers (>1:160) require more aggressive antifungal therapy.  The overall objective of this proposal is to identify a more clinically effective yet economically feasible treatment strategy for asymptomatic CRAG+ persons. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine if enhanced antifungal therapy improves 6-month survival for asymptomatic persons with high CRAG titers; 2) determine the cost-effectiveness of enhanced antifungal therapy for HIV-infected CRAG+ persons, stratified by CRAG titer; and 3) validate a novel semi-quantitative CRAG lateral flow assay to rapidly detect high CRAG titers (>1:160). The proposed study seeks to improve the international standard of clinical care for HIV-infected persons with advanced disease, and to generate evidence that will inform international HIV care guidelines. The findings and the training in decision analysis that Dr. Rajasingham will obtain will inform future proposals to evaluate cost-effective strategies to reduce AIDS-related deaths across sub-Saharan Africa."
