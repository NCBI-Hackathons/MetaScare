"9538446","Project Summary Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is a very prevalent cancer, affecting approximately 630,000 people per year. While every cancer has unique characteristics, HNSCC is especially heterogenous due to a variety of tissue origins and mutations. Inactivating mutations in Notch1 occur in 15-20% of HNSCC cases, a marked difference from the prevalence of Notch1 amplifications in other cancers. While Notch1 mutations are especially aggressive and associated with poor prognosis, we have also seen that they are associated with reduced expression of co-inhibitory receptors on immune cells. While co-inhibitory receptors are associated with immune exhaustion, they are also a natural consequence of immune cell activation. The reduced expression of inhibitory receptors in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is likely a sign of reduced immune activation. We will investigate the effect of Notch1 loss on the immunosuppressive environment in HNSCC and determine how this important signaling molecule might be impacting immunosurveillance. On the other side of the tumor-immune interaction, the other important question remains how to best block immune inhibition. Anti- PD-1 therapy has been a popular new treatment, but is only effective in 10-20% of cases. However, PD-1 is not the only inhibitory receptor on immune cells, and others such as lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) are equally important. We will investigate how dual inhibition of these receptors can be optimized with respect to timing and strategic targeting of different receptors. The findings of these studies are expected to develop new approaches to cancer immunotherapy and optimizing strategies to existing immunotherapy treatments."
"9415549","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) orchestrates protein folding and secretion and the unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains ER homeostasis. The UPR is mediated by three signal transduction pathways, controlled by the proteins PERK, IRE1?, and ATF6, that act to clear unfolded proteins from the ER. Sustained elevation of the UPR, or its insufficient activation, contributes to the pathology of diseases such as diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Osteoblasts are bone forming cells that secrete large amounts of collagen and have extensive ER. Moreover, humans and mice lacking a functional version of the PERK gene display several metabolic defects and have low bone mass. However, it is not clear whether the reduced bone mass is due to a decrease in the UPR in osteoblasts or in other cell types. Some osteoblasts become buried in new bone matrix and become osteocytes, which produce factors that control bone remodeling. Osteocyte death can induce factors that stimulate production of bone resorbing osteoclasts. In preliminary studies, we found that induction of ER stress in mice and osteocyte-containing bone cultures increased osteoclastogenic cytokine production, osteoclast number, and bone resorption. Conversely, in a mouse model of glucocorticoid excess, which causes bone loss in humans, we observed reduced expression of downstream mediators of the UPR. This evidence suggests that either excessive or insufficient UPR activation can lead to bone loss. Based on this, we propose the central hypothesis that components of the UPR play an essential role in osteoblast differentiation and function, and dysregulation of the UPR in cells of the osteoblast lineage contributes to pathological bone loss. To test this hypothesis, we will determine whether Perk plays an essential role in osteoblast physiology by conditionally deleting this gene from cells of the osteoblast lineage using Osx1-Cre transgenic mice (Aim 1). We will also determine the skeletal consequences of sustained elevation of the UPR in cells of the osteoblast-lineage by deleting the protein-folding co-chaperone ERdj4 specifically in these cells followed by a comprehensive analysis of the skeleton and osteoblast gene expression (Aim 2). Lastly, we will determine whether glucocorticoid excess inhibits bone formation in mice, in part, by suppressing UPR activation using UPR reporter mice treated with exogenous glucocorticoids and biochemical analyses of UPR pathways (Aim 3). The scientific theme of the proposed Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research is that genetic analysis of musculoskeletal diseases will support development of novel therapies for such conditions. The proposed studies are aligned with this theme and their successful completion may identify new therapeutic targets for common causes of osteoporosis. These studies will be supported by all three proposed COBRE research cores and the Project Leader will be mentored by a two-member team and other members of Center. Results produced during the first 2 years of the project will lead to the submission of an R01 grant application by the end of the second year of COBRE support."
"9438380","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic illnesses worldwide. Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated the comorbidity of these conditions, with longitudinal reports suggesting that obesity is a risk factor for the development of asthma and vice versa. Asthma and obesity have strong genetic components, and twin studies suggest that a potential mechanism explaining the asthma-obesity association is shared genetic predisposition or genetic pleiotropy. However, to date, only a few studies have empirically sought to identify the posited pleiotropic variants. Those studies had limited success in identifying pleiotropic loci and had important methodological constraints, including the use of a candidate-gene approach. Specifically, the candidate-gene approach is limited by our current understanding of the genetic architectures of obesity and asthma and of the mechanistic overlaps between the two diseases. Therefore, our study will search for genetic variants that display pleiotropy for asthma and obesity using a hypothesis-free genome-wide association study approach. Two analytic methods will be employed: (1) a univariate pleiotropy-informed false discovery rate-based framework and (2) a multivariate approach called MultiPhen. Our discovery-phase analyses will utilize existing genotype and phenotype data from the third wave of the Nord-TrØndelag Health study (HUNT3). The HUNT3 analytic sample will consist of n=27,712 adults aged 20 years or older [11,285 obese and 1,119 asthmatic cases (of which 639 are both obese and asthmatic), and 15,947 non-asthmatic, normal weight controls]. Genome-wide significant pleiotropic loci identified in HUNT3 will be candidates for replication. Our replication-phase analyses will utilize existing phenotype and whole-exome sequencing data from Dr. Andrew DeWan's FAstGen Study. The FAstGen analytic sample will consist of n=384 adults aged 18 years or older [182 obese and 154 asthmatic cases (of which 81 are both obese and asthmatic) and 129 non- asthmatic, normal weight controls]. In secondary analyses, we will characterize the effects of the candidate pleiotropic loci via mediation analyses. We will also investigate whether the candidate pleiotropic loci are associated with asthma and obesity in children, using data from a subset of HUNT3 subjects who were originally recruited into the first wave of the adolescent component of HUNT (Young-HUNT1) and thus also have phenotype data from adolescence [n=1,202; ages 13-19 years]. Lastly, we will evaluate the performance of our two analytic methods, using replication of pleiotropic signals as a metric of the relative performance of the methods. This will be the first study to investigate pleiotropy for asthma and obesity on a genome-wide scale, using pleiotropy-informed methods and incorporating mediation analyses to characterize pleiotropic effects. Findings from this work will advance our understanding of the mechanistic links between asthma and obesity; provide the first comparison of the performance of our two pleiotropy detection methods using real- world data; and promote specific prevention and treatment efforts for obese asthmatics."
"9390497","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Nicholas Abend is an Associate Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. His career goal is to be an expert clinical trialist leading development of interventions that improve outcomes among children with acute brain injuries. He is completing the fifth year of a K23 Mentored Career Development award from NINDS addressing the epidemiology of electrographic seizures (ES) in critically ill children and the impact of ES on neurobehavioral outcomes. Since 2007, he has published 52 peer-reviewed research papers, including 45 related to critical care EEG and seizure management with 33 as first or senior author. To advance this line of investigation, Dr. Abend needs to extend his observational studies into interventional clinical trials capable of establishing whether optimized ES interventions improve neurobehavioral outcomes. The proposed training in clinical trial design, execution, data management, and team-science skills will optimally position Dr. Abend to conduct multi-center clinical trials of innovative neuroprotective strategies for children with acute brain injuries. Research: Dr. Abend?s K23 research has demonstrated that ES occur in 10-40% of children with acute brain injuries, and that EEG monitoring is required for identification since most ES lack any observable clinical correlate. Additionally, he has shown that high ES exposure is associated with unfavorable neurobehavioral outcomes after adjusting for brain injury severity and critical illness severity. Based on these data, an increasing number of children are undergoing EEG monitoring in pediatric intensive care units, and recent guidelines recommend widespread EEG monitoring use in critically ill children with acute brain injuries to identify ES. However, it is concerning that children experiencing high ES exposures have unfavorable outcomes despite current clinical efforts to manage ES. This problem prompts a critical need to develop optimized ES management strategies that are more targeted, appropriate, and timely to better mitigate ES induced secondary brain injury. Dr. Abend?s overall objective is to address several clinical trial readiness gaps important in conducting subsequent clinical trials of optimized ES management. Aim 1 will generate and validate a predictive model using clinical and EEG variables to discriminate between acutely encephalopathic critically ill children who will and will not subsequently experience high ES exposures. This cohort is known to have worse outcomes with current management and would be predicted to benefit from optimized management. Determining the cohort?s characteristics will be the foundation for selecting a cohort for subsequent clinical trials of ES management. Aim 2 will determine the safety and feasibility of a targeted and timely ES management intervention in critically ill children. In contrast to standard care which slowly identifies ES and escalates medications, the high-intensity multi-modal intervention consists of frequent full-array EEG review, rapid anti-seizure medication initiation following ES onset, and rapid administration of sequential anti- seizure medications at high doses if ES persist. In working towards a clinical trial addressing ES management, sub-aims will assess other clinical trial readiness gaps including the number of eligible patients, participant and clinician randomization willingness, and statistical analysis of outcome measure variation which will provide effect size estimates to inform the design of subsequent trials. Aim 3 will provide Dr. Abend with advanced training in multi-center clinical design and execution using a combination of advanced didactic coursework, training from investigators experienced in leading acute neurologic clinical trials, and practical experience conducting a clinical trial (Aim 2). This research is innovative since it will develop the first model to predict high ES exposure and thereby identify an optimal cohort for inclusion in subsequent studies, and it will perform the first safety and feasibility assessment of a standardized ES intervention in critically ill children. These contributions are significant because they provide a foundation for subsequent clinical trials that will potentially yield new neuroprotective strategies for children with acute brain injuries. Environment and Career Development: The training plan builds upon the mentorship and research infrastructure at the University of Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia that have supported Dr. Abend?s current productivity. The plan involves (1) didactic coursework focused on clinical trials, patient outcomes research, regulatory issues, and team-science skills, and (2) training from investigators experienced with each component required to conduct clinical trials focused on seizure management in critically ill children, and (3) practical experience conducting a clinical trial. This training will allow Dr. Abend to develop and execute subsequent clinical trials of neuroprotective strategies in critically ill children. Summary: The research aims, training plan, and world-class clinical research infrastructure at the University of Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia assure that Dr. Abend will become an even more productive independent clinical investigator who will excel at leading multi-site clinical trials focused on improving outcomes for critically ill children with acute brain injuries."
"9429075","SUMMARY The unifying postulate of this P01 proposal is that comparative studies of KSHV, EBV, and MHV68 will accelerate the discovery of pathways regulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that contribute to gammaherpesvirus latency and tumorigenesis. Specifically, we hypothesize A) that herpesviruses utilize lncRNAs to regulate both virus and host gene expression, and B) that viral lncRNAs and/or virus-perturbed host lncRNAs directly contribute to the genesis of virus-associated AIDS malignancies. To address these hypotheses we propose three highly integrated projects with the goal of functionally analyzing lncRNAs and their mechanisms of action. Project 1, led by Dr. Renne (University of Florida, UF), will investigate KSHV- encoded lncRNAs and alteration of host lncRNA expression in the context of HIV-associated KSHV malignancies. Project 2, led by Dr. Flemington (Tulane University) will interrogate Epstein-Barr virus lncRNAs and alteration of host lncRNA expression in the context of HIV-associated EBV malignancies. Project 3 led by Dr. Tibbetts (UF) will investigate function of MHV68 lncRNAs and alteration of host lncRNAs in the context of latency and lymphomagenesis in a facile murine model. Importantly, all projects are supported by strong novel preliminary data, including the discovery of new gammaherpesvirus lncRNAs using a novel multi-platform genomics approach and implicating some of these lncRNAs in viral biology and pathogenesis. The well- organized Administrative core (Core A, Core Leader: Rolf Renne) will maintain oversight and organization of the program, including biostatisical consultation and adherence to reproducibility and transparency standards. Two additional service cores, which are already established and very productive, will support sequencing, bioinformatics and recombinant virus generation needs across the three projects: The Virus RNA-seq and Bioinformatics Core will be maintained at Tulane University (Core B, Core Leader: Erik Flemington). The Recombinant Virus Core, which was established with an NCI-funded RC2 award in 2009, will be maintained at UF (Core C, Core Leader: Rolf Renne). In addition, Dr. Parsons (LSUHSC, New Orleans), who leads the NIH- supported LSUHSC/LCRC HIV Clinical and Biospecimen Repository, will facilitate the acquisition of valuable Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and lymphoma tumor specimens from HIV-infected patients. Our proposal is significant and highly innovative in terms of the field of study ? ?understanding virus and host lncRNA function in gammaherpesvirus tumorigenesis? ? and in applying numerous state-of-the-art techniques across all three projects. Finally, studying pathogenesis-relevant tissue culture and animal models, complemented by the analysis of human tumor tissues from EBV- and KSHV-associated malignancies, will greatly increase our understanding of both viral and host lncRNAs in the context of AIDS malignancies."
"9542425","Project Summary  The dimorphic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc), is endemic to the Midwestern and Southeastern US and is the most frequent cause of fungal respiratory infection. Yeast cells thrive in the intracellular environment of macrophages (M?) until these phagocytes are activated by cytokines such as interferon-? or granulocyte M? colony-stimulating factor. The transcriptional elements that license M? to promote clearance of the fungus are largely unknown. We have discovered that the transcription factors hypoxia inducing factors (HIF)-1? and -2? calibrate the behavior of M? infected with Hc. In a recent publication, we reported that the lack of HIF-1? in M? exacerbates infection with Hc by promoting the generation of interleukin (IL)-10. The absence of both HIF-1? and -2? further exaggerates IL-10 production by M?. Excessive IL-10 dampens the ability of activating cytokines to arm the anti-Hc function of M?. We demonstrate that Hc induces HIFs and that pharmacologically inflating HIF accrual enhances the anti-Hc activity of mouse and human M?. These data triggered two hypotheses: 1) HIFs in M? are required to temper IL-10 generation, and 2) pharmacologically amplifying expression of HIFs arms M? to exert anti-Hc activity. To test these hypotheses, we propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will examine the interplay between HIFs and metabolism. Specifically, we will determine if a glycolytic metabolite initiates and tumor necrosis factor-? sustains expression of HIFs. We will determine if overproduction of a specific metabolite by infected HIF-deficient cells promotes IL-10 release. Specific Aim 2 will examine how HIFs regulate IL-10. We will determine if miRNA-27a is involved in the generation of IL-10 and if IL-10 modifies the metabolism of HIF- deficient cells. We will test the possibility that a metabolic product regulates the expression of an miRNA that controls the decay of IL-10 transcription. We will ascertain if IL-1receptor antagonist is a downstream effector of IL-10-mediated inhibition of M? function. Specific Aim 3 will investigate how pharmacological activation of HIFs promotes the anti-Hc activity of M???We will identify a mechanism and the in vivo effect of these agents. We expect these studies to provide a greater understanding of the regulation of M? function in response to Hc."

"9072143","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While there has been great progress in understanding the risk architecture of autism, there are still unanswered questions about the nature of the genetic and non-genetic risk for autism. Many of these questions can be best addressed with a population-based epidemiological sample with detailed demographic and environmental information. To date, almost all studies on the etiology of autism relied on convenience samples, which are subject to biases in capturing genetic and, possibly even more so, environmental risk. Epidemiologically based samples provide a unique resource to identify genetic and non-genetic causes of autism, while allowing for a precise estimate of risk in the population attributed to each source of risk. Sweden benefits from a centralized medical system that has been the foundation of large-scale epidemiological studies in psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In our opinion, the significance of this proposal lies in the value of a unique, population-based epidemiological sample, analyzed in such a way as to address several outstanding issues in autism. These include: 1) better estimates of heritability and environment in autism; 2) assessing the rate of recurrent risk CNV in autism; 3) discovery of rare standing single nucleotide variation in autism; 4) dissection of mechanisms underlying the association of non-genetic findings with autism-and the discovery of novel environmental associations; and, 5) cross-disorder analyses to better understand shared liability to autism and schizophrenia. The aims are: 1) To ascertain and biobank at least 1300 cases with autistic disorder and 1000 additional controls, to develop an international resource for ASD, and to assess selected, putative risk factors; 2) To genotype all samples using high-density SNP arrays, including dense exome coverage, and sequence all trios using whole-exome approaches; and, 3) To use novel methods to assess the role of inherited and de novo variants in autism and to evaluate rare standing variation in autism, while integrating key environmental variables. In later years the relationship between autism risk and risk for schizophrenia will be assessed. The proposed research is innovative, in our opinion, because it ascertains autism samples in an epidemiologically valid manner, targeting a genetically homogenous population, for which schizophrenia and bipolar samples have already been collected. The proposal is also innovative in the use of novel methods to estimate heritability and to identify rare, standing variation conferring risk to autism, while providing an integrated model for genetics and environment in autism. Finally, the application is innovative, in our opinion, in that it provides he groundwork for understanding shared risk across autism and schizophrenia, making use of a homogenous group to have better power to identify shared risk. This new and substantively    different approach to studying autism, compared to studies carried out in convenience samples,  addresses many of the open questions in autism research and provides a path towards a better understanding of the risk factors for autism and ultimately to better interventions in autism."
"9398807","The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate a new multiple sclerosis (MS) spasticity education and stretching program called MS Spasticity: Take Control (STC) in a fully powered, randomized, controlled trial for benefit after one month (short-term) of home stretching practice and sustainability of benefit after six months (medium- term) of home stretching practice. Important first steps are complete: 1) the Spasticity and MS Clinical Practice Guideline has been developed; 2) the proposed PI has created a self-management program, STC, for MS- related spasticity that includes two DVDs MS Spasticity: Take Control (with educational information) and MS Spasticity: Take Control of Lower Extremity Stretching (with standardized stretching instructions) and companion reference manuals, and 3) the program has been tested in 40 subjects with MS and spasticity. STC demonstrated initial efficacy as well as feasibility, acceptance and rapid enrollment with satisfaction reported by participants. In the present study, eligible subjects in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington will be randomly assigned 1:1 to STC or usual care (UC). STC subjects will attend two in-person group sessions with the PI and the study coordinator to view and discuss information presented in both DVDs at the first session and practice all the stretches in the second session with the goal of finding a set of exercises for daily stretching for their home practice for the following six months. UC subjects will not attend classes but, instead, will be given a copy of the NMSS stretching brochure to use in their home practice without instruction or group support. The primary endpoint outcome measures will be collected after the classes for the STC group and one month of home practice. The same outcome measures will be collected after six months of home practice for the secondary endpoint when subjects will exit the study. Both groups will start their home practice within two weeks of each other, within two months of baseline data collection and be provided the same diaries to track their home stretching and other exercise participation. The primary outcome measure is the MS Spasticity Scale 88. Secondary outcome measures are the Numeric Rating Scale for Spasticity and the National Institute of Health (NIH) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) collection that specifically assess fatigue, sleep, physical function, self-efficacy, social participation, social satisfaction and perception of global health from their online collection of patient-reported health status inventories and outcome measures with the novel capability of administering computerized adaptive tests (CATs). CATs adapt to the individual by selecting subsequent questions based on participants? prior responses reducing the length of the tests and therefore each test takes approximately one to two minutes to complete. The NIH recommends using these outcome measures to accelerate discovery by making studies more easily comparable. A new standardized program for MS spasticity including lower extremity stretching now exists, has feasibility and initial efficacy and needs testing in a fully powered trial for short and medium term benefit. If effective, such treatment would be expected to impact the day-to-day function, enhance participation with families and the community and improve health related quality of life for all people with MS and spasticity. A web-based intervention could be created from the current program for dissemination throughout the VA and, if effective, could be adapted to other neurological conditions with spasticity such as spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury and stroke and also easily disseminated worldwide. We anticipate 48 months to recruit subjects in Oregon and Washington, deliver the intervention, follow them for 6 months, report the results and submit for a future trial of STC or development of a web-based version of the program."

"9429079","Project summary The transforming human gammaherpesviruses EBV and KSHV establish stable latent infections in B cells, providing a lifelong reservoir of virus that can contribute to the development of malignant disease. Thus, defining the mechanisms that govern long-term latency is critical for designing rational strategies to prevent disease. In vivo studies of gammaherpesviruses in humans have been severely limited by the difficulties of working in the natural host. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is related to EBV and KSHV and causes lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disease in mice, providing a readily manipulable small animal model for mechanistic studies of the virus/host relationship in vivo. Like EBV and KSHV, MHV68 expresses lncRNAs whose functions during infection and pathogenesis are largely unknown. As virus-encoded lncRNAs are abundantly expressed in vivo in B cells during long-term latency and in hyperplastic B cell lesions during lymphoproliferative disease, we hypothesize that these lncRNAs play key roles in latency and lymphomagenesis. In support of this, our new data demonstrates that the MHV68 TMER4 transcript acts a unique lncRNA that is essential for latency and pathogenesis. Using a combination of cutting-edge high throughput sequencing approaches and a novel bioinformatic pipeline, we have now generated a comprehensive map of validated MHV68 lncRNA transcripts. With results from this discovery phase in hand, we will now test the hypothesis that MHV68 lncRNAs are essential for latency and tumorigenesis. We will: 1) Determine the roles of high priority MHV68 lncRNAs during in vivo infection; 2) Define the molecular mechanism by which lncRNA TMER4 facilitates latent infection, and determine the tripartite regulatory relationship between the novel M3M2 lncRNA, antisense TMERs/miRNAs and latency protein M2, and 3) Determine the role of virus and host lncRNAs in lymphomagenesis. The use of new genomic, bioinformatic and mutagenesis technology, in conjunction with systematic in vivo analyses of MHV68 lncRNA mutants, provides an extremely powerful means to determine the molecular mechanism by which lncRNAs contribute to gammaherpesvirus infection and lymphomagenesis in vivo. Further, the unique collaborative nature of this program project should allow us to define the contribution of common lncRNA-targeted pathways to latency and tumorigenesis."
"9543150","Tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells are potent mediators of immunity against infectious pathogens in peripheral tissues. Published studies from our laboratory now establish a crucial role for TRM cells in immunity to cancer. We show that immunotherapy-induced CD8 TRM cells mediate immunity to melanoma in the skin, and that autoimmune vitiligo is a key host requirement for generating these durably protective TRM cells. Vitiligo has long been recognized as a positive prognostic factor in melanoma patients. We find that the skin of vitiligo- affected mice provides a hospitable niche for the residence of memory T cells that provide durable, protective, antitumor immunity. We hypothesize that a diverse complement of functional memory T cells in peripheral tissues underlies the durable tumor immunity observed in mice and melanoma patients with vitiligo and other cutaneous inflammatory events. Our first Specific Aim will be to determine the contribution of TRM cells to metastatic tumor protection. Mice with vitiligo also maintain protection against lung metastases, and our preliminary data reveal a distinct population of tumor-specific TRM cells in the lungs of mice with vitiligo. We will test the hypothesis that lung TRM cells and lymphoid TEM cells together prevent metastatic melanoma growth, and define a core transcriptional signature for lung and skin TRM cells. Our second Specific Aim will be to define the tumor antigen specificity of protective TRM recall responses in skin. Our data show that TRM cells in vitiligo- affected skin have specificity for melanocyte/melanoma shared antigens, as well as a model tumor-specific antigen. We will determine how antigen recognition affects T cell function and competition for the TRM niche, and test the hypothesis that TRM cells with specificity for both tumor/self antigens and neoantigens mediate the rejection of melanoma and non-melanoma tumors in the skin. Finally, our third Specific Aim will be to determine the role of antigen-unrelated cutaneous inflammation in promoting TRM responses to melanoma. We will test the hypothesis that melanocyte-unrelated skin inflammation can generate melanoma-specific TRM cells by assessing TRM cell responses in skin biopsies from melanoma patients with vitiligo and other cutaneous inflammatory events. Preclinical work will focus on a therapeutic approach for promoting TRM responses in conjunction with immune checkpoint inhibition. Overall, this project will define the role of resident memory T cells in the immune response to cancer. By demonstrating a fundamental role for TRM cells in host-wide immunity to cancer, these studies are expected to have a transformative impact on the way that immunotherapies are delivered and evaluated.  "
"9416118","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."
"9523808","Project Summary Stroke is the leading cause of physical disability worldwide and represents a global socioeconomic burden to human health. Despite an intense research effort that led to a plethora of targets and neuroprotectants to reduce stroke-induced brain injury in animals, the neuroprotection-based strategies resulted in little or no efficacy in numerous controlled clinical trials. These observations indicate that there should be a paradigm shift to enhance the translational efficacy issue and improve this devastating condition. Potential missing links that account for the translational hindrances include solely relying on infarct size without considering brain swelling to gauge neuroprotection in preclinical studies. In addition, there is a paucity of inclusion of risk factors in animal models of stroke, whereas comorbidities such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are frequently observed conditions in patients. The combined evidence supports the conclusion that there is a critical need to define stroke pathology focusing on brain swelling in metabolically compromised conditions, which is the overall scientific premise for the proposed research. Our recent findings showed that mice with diabetes and hyperlipidemia displayed disproportionately larger brain swelling compared to infarct volume, and the enhanced brain swelling was closely associated with an increased level of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a key signaling molecule for vascular permeability and angiogenesis. As obesity is a precipitating cause leading to metabolic disorders including diabetes and dyslipidemia, we hypothesized that VEGFR2 underlies obesity-enhanced brain swelling in stroke and that blocking VEGFR2 activation reduces the swelling and promotes functional recovery in obesity. Aim 1 will identify the role of VEGFR2 activation(s) on stroke-induced brain swelling in obese mice by assessing histological and molecular outcomes. In Aim 2, the loss and gain of function studies will evaluate the efficacy of VEGFR2 modulation on obesity-enhanced stroke-induced brain swelling using pharmacological and genetic approaches. Aim 3 will determine the impact of brain swelling on long-term stroke recovery by assessing long-term motor and cognitive function in obese mice where VEGF signaling is manipulated. At the completion of the project, we expect to obtain scientific evidence establishing the importance of VEGF signaling in obesity-enhanced brain swelling, the utility of VEGF inhibition as a treatment strategy in obesity stroke, and reducing brain swelling as an approach to promoting long-term stroke recovery. These results are expected to have a significant impact by providing strong justification for the repurposing of available VEGF-targeted anti- angiogenic/anti-cancer drugs to treat stroke patients with obesity and its associated comorbidities."

Unlike the classic dentate gyrus-CA3-CA1 hippocampal circuit, little is known about area CA2. New reports of CA2's role in social learning provide a compelling link between this brain region and these psychiatric diseases. Therefore, understanding signaling proteins and mechanisms in hippocampal neurons is key to understanding their roles in human neuro-pathophysiology. We reported that RGS14 is highly enriched in CA2 pyramidal neurons of adult mouse, monkey and humans. We reported that RGS14 is a scaffolding protein that integrates Gi, ERK, and Ca++ signaling pathways essential for synaptic plasticity. Moreover, we discovered that RGS14 is critically important as a natural suppressor of synaptic plasticity in CA2 neurons but not CA1. RGS14-KO mice exhibit a marked and unexpected reinstatement of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA2 neurons paired with an enhancement of hippocampal- based learning and memory, with no differences in other behaviors. RGS14 also blocks LTP in CA1 neurons when introduced, indicating it engages signaling pathways common to both CA2 and CA1 neurons. These findings highlight the importance of understanding cellular mechanism(s) whereby RGS14 regulates synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. While most of what we know about RGS14 relates to regulation of postsynaptic signaling (Gi, ERK and Ca++) at dendritic spines, we also found that RGS14 localizes to various subcellular compartments including the nucleus. Within monkey brain, we show a subpopulation of native RGS14 localizes to the nuclei of neurons. Consistent with this, RGS14 contains both a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and export sequence (NES) that enables it to shuttle in-out of the nucleus. Remarkably, we identified rare human variants of RGS14 (L504Q, R507Q) that alter the NES site resulting in RGS14 accumulation in the nucleus. This observation, along with the fact that RGS14 is a natural nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, beg the question: what is RGS14 doing in the nuclei of neurons? Our studies here show that native RGS14 localizes to the nuclei of host cells in close proximity to open DNA and active RNA Polymerase II. Based on this, we hypothesize that RGS14 serves a key role in the nuclei of hippocampal neurons, possibly as a synapse- to-nucleus co-regulator of transcribed genes important for synaptic plasticity. Therefore, the goals of these exploratory studies are to: AIM 1: Determine the effects of RGS14 and nuclear localizing human variants of RGS14 on synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. AIM 2: Identify RGS14 binding partners and their signaling roles in the nuclei of hippocampal neurons. AIM 3: Determine the effects of RGS14 and nuclear localizing RGS14 variants on gene transcription in hippocampal neurons. !"
"9536290","Project Summary/Abstract A considerable body of evidence implicates type I interferons (IFNs) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, the ?interferon signature? does not address the source and the key pathogenic type I IFNs in SLE, making it challenging to design effective precision medicine for SLE. We propose the novel hypothesis that it is the endogenous production of IFN? by B cells that plays a defining role in shaping the autoantibody response and disease activity in a substantial subset of patients with SLE. We have found, in humans and mice, that the transitional (Tr) stage of B-cell development is characterized by heterogeneity in IFN? expression at the single- cell level. Our preliminary data further suggest that: (i) Tr B cells with high endogenous production of IFN? undergo strong IFN? autocrine signaling and changes in the transcriptome signature in a manner that supports RNA/RNP-associated TLR7 responses. This imprinted signature promotes subsequent survival and development of RNP-reactive B cells including their differentiation into long-lived memory B cells; and (ii) Anti- dsDNA autoAb producing cells are derived from Tr cells that do not express high levels of endogenous IFN? expression; however, high levels of endogenous IFN? in memory B cells play a critical role in the differentiation of short-lived anti-dsDNA memory B cells. The model is supported by compelling preliminary data including analyses of PBMCs from SLE patients that indicated significantly higher IFN? expression in B cells from SLE patients with renal involvement and significantly higher expression of intracellular IFN? in B cells from female African-American (AA) SLE patients as compared with non-AA patients and healthy controls. In Aim 1, we will establish if lupus flare is associated with increases in IFN?hi memory B cells and if this phenotype is more common in AA SLE patients. High-throughput single-cell transcriptome analysis coupled with state-of-the-art computational analysis will be used to identify transcriptional signatures in DNA- and RNA-reactive B cells to refine this marker; to establish if, as predicted, there is commonality between the RNP-reactive Tr and memory B cell transcriptome; and to identify the association of enhanced IFN? signaling with stage-specific dysregulation of downstream pathways. Functional and target-specific analysis of sorted human PBMCs will then be used to determine if endogenous B-cell IFN? and its downstream pathways are essential for RNA- vs DNA-ligand mediated Tr and memory B-cell activation and survival. In Aim 2, we will use the same approaches in the BXD2 lupus model and BCR transgenic mice to determine if endogenous IFN? is essential for, and differentially regulates, anti-RNP and anti-DNA B cell development in vivo. This hypothetical model does not negate the contributions of other cells and factors to the pathogenesis of SLE but reframes the current paradigm. The data generated will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of SLE, identify novel therapeutic targets and provide the basis for development of precision medicine-guided approaches to utilization of currently available therapies in a significant subset of patients."
"9544550","Project Summary/Abstract The overall objective is to define the molecular mechanisms through which Ca2+ homeostasis is perturbed in different brain diseases and how ion channels contribute to complex Ca2+-signaling intimately linked to neuronal damage and death. Our studies focus on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) that is the primary Ca2+ release channel of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cell's major Ca2+ storage organelle. Gating of IP3R is initiated by IP3 binding but tightly regulated by many additional signals, notably by interactions with pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members. Strong evidence suggests that de-regulation of IP3R inevitably leads to pathological conditions by ether an exaggerated cell death as in neurodegenerative diseases or escape from cell death as in some types of cancer. Despite recent progress in our understanding of how Bcl-2 proteins regulate the apoptotic switch, the structural basis for Ca2+ signaling disturbance in apoptosis via IP3R channels is largely unknown. There is a pressing need for atomic level structural information on how IP3R interacts with apoptotic proteins to coordinate its gating. To address this challenge, we extend our cryo-EM studies to recombinant full-length tetrameric IP3R1 purified from cultured cells (aim 1). The overarching goal of this aim is to push resolution limits in our cryo-EM studies of IP3R beyond 4.0 Å resolution recently achieved by our group for type 1 IP3R (IP3R1), purified from cerebellum. Using recombinant protein technology, we anticipate isolating more homogeneous channel sample than is likely present in native tissues. This will facilitate progress towards atomic-resolution structure determination and will allow to resolve protein regions that are missing in cryo-EM structure of native IP3R1 due to its genuine structural heterogeneity. Our goal is to solve structure of IP3R1 in complex with Bcl-2 protein to unveil the structural basis for the functional interactions of IP3R1 with modulatory apoptotic proteins, and to determine how the interplay between members of the Bcl-2 family sets the apoptotic threshold for cell life-or-death decision (aim 2). Structural studies will be complemented by functional experiments to establish physiological relevance of structural discoveries. The proposed studies are innovative since little is known at the atomic level about regulation of the IP3R channel by its binding partners, including apoptotic proteins. Because IP3R and Bcl-2 proteins are important to cell survival, adaptation and death processes, the proposed studies are significant to both our understanding of normal cellular physiology, and also to diseases associated with disturbed Ca2+ signaling and defective apoptosis, including neurodegeneration and cancer. Overall, this project represents the essential step towards atomistic descriptions of IP3R channel gating that will provide novel structural insights into critical IP3R channel functions and will serve as a platform for the development of future drugs targeting human IP3R."

"9470329","Statement of Problem: The arterial chemoreflex is an essential protective mechanism for adaptive responses to hypoxia (Hx). However, chemoreflex dysfunction, including over-excitation of chemoreflex pathways leads to respiratory instability, increased sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and hypertension in disease states, including heart failure and hypertension. Information regarding mechanisms of action in the chemoreflex neurocircuitry is lacking. The neuropeptide neurons CRH and OT neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) may influence sympathoexcitatory and respiratory control via projections to brainstem cardiorespiratory nuclei. Previous studies indicate that CRH increases cardiorespiratory function in both healthy subjects and elderly patients dependent on artificial respiration, suggesting that CRH may offer therapeutic potential in various disease states that display chemoreflex dysfunction. However, the central mechanisms by which PVN neuropeptide neurons contribute to these responses are unclear. Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine the contribution of PVN CRH neurons to cardiorespiratory control at baseline and in response to peripheral chemoreflex stimulation Aim 2: To determine the contribution of PVN OT neurons to cardiorespiratory control, and examine central interactions between CRH and OT in the nTS Experimental Approach: The overall Hypothesis of this project is that PVN CRH neurons that project to the nTS enhance cardiorespiratory responses to chemoreflex stimulation via activation of nTS CRH receptors and OTergic mechanisms. Aim 1 will determine the extent to which PVN CRH neurons contribute to cardiorespiratory output at baseline and during peripheral chemoreflex stimulation via projections to the nTS. Aim 2 will determine the extent to which PVN CRH and OT neurons modulate cardiorespiratory responses to chemoreflex via interactions within the nTS. Significance of Results: The long-term objectives of this study are to further characterize interactions between the PVN and the nTS, and the mechanisms by which this reciprocal pathway shapes cardiorespiratory responses to peripheral chemoreflex stimulation. Determining the pathways, circuits and mechanism(s) mediating chemoreflex function and how these may be changed in disease would be of great benefit in designing rational and targeted therapeutic approaches in these debilitating diseases."
"9551229","Project Summary: Relative Efficacy of single-, bi-, and tri-hormonal Closed-Loop Control systems  When blood glucose concentrations rise (e.g., in response to meals), amylin is co-secreted with insulin from the ? cells while glucagon secretion from the ? cells is inhibited. Conversely, as glucose levels decline, insulin and amylin secretion falls while glucagon secretion increases. Physical exercise is also accompanied by falling glucose, falling insulin and rising glucagon concentrations. In contrast, in Type 1 diabetes, due to concomitant ? cell dysfunction, there is hyperglucagonemia in the postprandial state and inadequate glucagon response during exercise thereby predisposing to postprandial hyperglycemia and post exercise hypoglycemia respectively. Recent studies with closed loop artificial pancreas systems have applied single-hormone (insulin only) or dual hormone (insulin + glucagon) approaches for short term glucose control in type 1 diabetes without attempting to restore normal hormonal milieu in these individuals during meals and exercise. The innovative approach outlined in this application seeks to restore, to the extent possible, normal hormonal milieu with meals and physical exercise. Using dual-chamber pumps and imminently available co-formulation of insulin and the amylin analogue pramlintide as a control mechanism, we aim to recreate normal postprandial hormonal profile in type 1 diabetes participants. The use of pramlintide will help suppress postprandial hyperglucagonemia, improve insulin sensitivity thus permitting a lower prandial dose of insulin. That in turn should prevent late postprandial hypoglycemia. The use of glucagon will be limited only as a safety-rescue mechanism that will be triggered by declining glucose levels especially during and after physical exercise. We also propose to apply the computed insulin sensitivity parameters (with pramlintide and during exercise) using the insulin pump infusion rates and CGM derived glucose excursions to inform the algorithm, test its safety in silico experiments, refine the tri-hormonal (insulin + pramlintide + glucagon) algorithm and eventually test it's efficacy in a long-term clinical trial vs. single- (insulin only) and bi- hormonal (insulin + pramlintide) algorithms.  The proposed studies therefore incorporate several innovations that include the following: application of insulin sensitivity parameters during closed loop studies; use of insulin-pramlintide as a control mechanism to mimic the healthy ? cell; amelioration of postprandial hyperglucagonemia with use of insulin-pramlintide combination; use of glucagon only as a rescue mechanism for impending hypoglycemia especially during exercise as occurs in health thus mimicking the healthy ? cell; finally and most importantly testing the tri- hormonal approach versus contemporary single- and bi-hormonal systems in a long term at home clinical trial."
"9492416","PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a wide range of nervous system pathologies that are generally characterized by progressive loss of cognitive and/or motor function, memory loss and dementia. With the increasing age of the population in the United States, the number of people affected by neurodegenerative diseases is expected to triple in the coming years, with most patients afflicted with Alzheimer?s disease. Unfortunately, there are limited or no treatment options for most neurodegenerative diseases. A growing number of studies suggest that deficits in vascular function within the central nervous system can be precipitating events that initiate neurodegeneration. Normally, the blood brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from plasma components that would otherwise lead to cellular damage. However, chronic BBB breakdown results in leakage of serum components from the bloodstream into the central nervous system. Over time, buildup of toxic metabolites leads to cellular damage and neurodegeneration. The BBB is comprised of endothelial cells surrounded by mural cells, referred to as pericytes, and astrocytes. In both mouse and humans, loss of pericyte coverage at the BBB is associated with increased vascular leakage and the formation of calcified plaques. In humans, this defect can result in reduced cognitive function and Parkinson?s disease-like symptoms. Thus, pericyte coverage is essential for maintaining BBB integrity and limiting neurodegeneration. Despite this important role, we know little concerning how the BBB pericyte lineage is established and maintained during development. This is largely due to the lack of reliable and specific markers for BBB pericytes. This knowledge gap hinders both our understanding of BBB pericyte ontogeny and our ability to specifically manipulate this essential type in experimental settings. To address these issues, we will apply genome-wide approaches using the zebrafish as a model system to identify enhancer elements that are specific to BBB pericytes. In particular, we will identify regions of chromatin in the zebrafish genome that are specifically open in BBB pericytes. We will take advantage of double transgenic zebrafish that enable enrichment of pericyte populations. By isolating pericyte nuclei from several different tissues and comparing their open chromatin profiles, it will be possible to identify elements that are putative enhancers in BBB pericytes. We will then test activity of putative BBB pericyte enhancers in zebrafish reporter assays. We will take advantage of the ability to perform in vivo reporter assays in zebrafish to assess candidate BBB pericyte-specific enhancers. Together these studies will yield novel insights into the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks that contribute to pericyte function and maintenance of the BBB."
"9424262","Abstract  Fluorescence imaging is used widely in almost all the biosciences. Examples include imaging of microscope slides with spots of DNA or proteins, multiplexed assays of classes of molecules like cytokines or capture immunoassays. Fluorescence occurs in all directions and it is necessary to collect as much of the emission as possible and to focus the emission onto a detector. The instruments for these measurements all contain multiple lens, mirrors and filters for directing the emission towards the detector. The optical components and principles have not changed in over 100 years. A modern microscope has the same shape and configuration as those over 100 years old. In contrast there has been enormous progress in electronics where the cost per GB of memory has decreased 1 million-fold.  We propose a widely applicable approach to fluorescence imaging that can provide high spatial resolution over large areas, easily up to the frame size of 35 mm film. This will be accomplished using Tamm structures which consist of multiple layers of dielectrics and a top metallic layer; which are called Tamm structures (TS). These structures contain no nanoscale features in the x-y plane and vapor deposition can produce large area structures at low cost. Tamm structures support optical modes which are perpendicular to the surface, and we have recently shown fluorophores close to the surface couple to these modes and also radiate perpendicular to the surface. In this project the Tamm structures will be placed directly onto CMOS imaging detectors (CID) for imaging. We refer to this method as coupled-emission microscopy (CEM). Practical CEM devices require improved z-axis confinement and reduced sample-to-detector distances.  We propose development of CEM to obtain a spatial resolution of 1 ?m or better. This will be accomplished by optical simulations and refined methods for preparation of Tamm structures and other multi- layer structures (MLS). Two independent methods will be used to test for improved z-axis confinement and improved coupling efficiency. Commercial CIDs contain protective cover slips which prevent close contact with the Tamm structures. Methods will be developed to place the TS directly onto the CID surface and for higher spatial resolution fabrication of the Tamm structure directly on the CID surface. Various methods of illumination and/or thin-film filters will be developed to reject incident light. Spatial resolution will be measured using fluorescent nanobeads (NBs) as point sources will also be used to determine the number of independent measurable locations. The effects of surface topology will be examined for effects on spatial resolution and sensitivity by increases in fluorophore-TS coupling efficiency. We will also examine alternative structures which are known to display perpendicular modes such as the three layer metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) structures and structures which do not contain any metal and display optical Tamm states (OTS). Replacement of even a small fraction of existing instruments with CEM devices would have a large impact on biology and medicine."
"9469704","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intraocular tumor in adults and accounts for approximately 5% of all melanomas. UM metastasizes primarily to the liver in 50% of patients, and currently there are no suitable treatment options. In contrast to most cutaneous melanomas, which contain mutations in BRAF or NRAS, ~90% of all uveal melanomas contain activating mutations in either GNAQ or GNA11, which code for the G?q and G?11 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. These two proteins are 90% homologous at the amino acid level and stimulate common signaling pathways. The activating mutations are almost always seen at the Q209 or R183 residues and render G?q/11 constitutively active when bound to GTP due to the loss of its intrinsic GTPase activity. Introduction of the GNAQ-Q209L mutant, but not wild-type GNAQ, into human or mouse melanocytes results in anchorage-independent growth and gives rise to heavily pigmented tumors in vivo. G?q/11 is involved in many downstream signaling pathways and its constitutive activity in UM leads to an increase in the activation of MAPK, Akt and the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, which stimulates the transcription of growth promoting genes. We believe that it would be advantageous to directly inhibit oncogenic G?q/11 and prevent the activation of these various cell proliferating pathways. To this end, we have tested the compound QIC, known to specifically inhibit wild type G?q/11, and found that is also capable of inhibiting oncogenic G?q/11 found in UM. Based on these results, we hypothesize that we can use G?q/11 inhibitors such as QIC to provide a better mechanistic understanding of the role that oncogenic G?q/11 plays in UM. To test this hypothesis, we will: 1) further characterize the mechanism by which G?q/11 specific inhibitors inhibit oncogenic G?q/11 proteins in vitro; 2) assess the effects of G?q/11 inhibition on downstream signaling in uveal melanoma cells; and 3) determine the effect of G?q/11 inhibition on uveal melanoma cell growth and migration. Taken together, these studies will enable a better mechanistic understanding of the role of G?q/11 in uveal melanoma and set the stage for the use of G?q/11 inhibitors in animal models."
"9528226","Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with intracellular aggregation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn). However, the molecular mechanism of aSyn aggregation is not well understood. Our hypothesis is that alteration of essential interactions of aSyn during its translation (when it is still in the process of synthesis) leads to its misfolding and aggregation triggering initiation of the disease process. These changes of interactions can be triggered by a mutation (familial PD) or by defects in binding factors (sporadic PD). This hypothesis is supported by our experimental studies conducted on several proteins associated with human diseases: granulin (frontotemporal dementia), CFTR (cystic fibrosis), prolactin (infertility), and also by the recent discovery of a novel pathway of translational regulation, RAPP, that sensors quality of nascent chains during translation. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1: To identify aSyn interacting partners during translation in health and disease. We will use advantage of the recently developed unique approach iPINCH to identify the interacting proteins for wild-type and mutated (A30P, E46K, A53T) aSyns. Aim 2: Use a candidate approach to test involvement of folding, targeting and protein quality control factors in aSyn expression and folding. Recent studies demonstrate that ribosome-associated chaperones, chaperonins and components of RAPP pathway interact with nascent chains during translation. We will test their involvement in the expression and folding of wild-type and mutated aSyns by their RNAi knockdowns in cultured human cells. This project will lead to better understanding of the molecular mechanism of aSyn aggregation and identification of potential pharmacological targets for the disease treatments."
"9604715","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vitamin C is an indispensable micronutrient for normal human health and well-being. Vitamin C deficiency leads to a variety of clinical abnormalities. The vitamin acts as a potent antioxidant and a cofactor for several enzymes, with low intracellular levels causing oxidative stress, a driver for many human diseases. Therefore, studies designed to optimize overall vitamin C body homeostasis are important. Humans have lost the ability to synthesis vitamin C endogenously, and must obtain it via intestinal absorption. The intestinal absorption process involves the human sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters-1 & 2 (hSVCT1& hSVCT2), where hSVCT1 is exclusively expressed at the apical membrane of the polarized enterocytes whereas hSVCT2 is localized basolaterally. The objectives of this proposal are to continue our investigations into the molecular physiology/cell biology of intestina vitamin C uptake process, and to address specific aspects of its pathophysiology as well as to determine the effect of external/internal factors on the uptake process. Our new preliminary studies suggest the involvement of microRNA and epigenetic mechanism(s) in the regulation of hSVCT1 expression, identified putative novel hSVCT1 interacting partners, and show a significant inhibition in vitamin C uptake upon exposure to specific enteric pathogens (EPEC and ETEC), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and to bacterial LPS. Based on these findings, our working hypotheses are: i) microRNA and epigenetic mechanism(s) regulate SVCT1 expression and function; ii) hSVCT1 has interacting partners that affect its physiology/cell biology; and iii) exposure to enteric pathogens, pro- inflammatory cytokines, and to bacterial LPS leads to a significant inhibition in intestinal vitamin C uptake. Three specific aims are proposed to test these hypotheses and will utilize state-of- the-art cell/molecular approaches. Results of these investigations should provide valuable information regarding the intestinal vitamin C absorption process under normal physiological conditions, and how this event is affected by specific pathophysiological factors. This should ultimately help us in designing effective strategies to optimize normal vitamin C body homeostasis, especially in conditions of deficiency/sub-optimal levels."

"9442306","Abstract  Giardia lamblia is the most common protozoan cause of diarrhea in the world. It infects ~500 million people worldwide, often resulting in nutrient malabsorption which can lead to physical and cognitive developmental defects in children. The infection is transmitted buy ingestion of cysts and the cyst wall contains large amounts of N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) polymer. The macrophage galactose-binding lectin (MGL) is the dominant lectin capable of recognizing GalNAc. Our hypothesis is that recognition of cyst wall material by MGL plays a significant role in determining the outcome of infections by modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Sepcifically, we hypothesize that MGL2 on dendritic cells recongizes parasite glycans leading to release of cytokines that promote production of the cytokine IL-17 by both innate and adaptive lymphocytes. IL-17 has recently been shown to be essential for resolution of Giardia infections. The balance between these competing forces will determine whether infections are resolved rapidly or become chronic. We will address these hypotheses by examining infections in mice lacking cells which express MGL2 or which lack MGL2 itself. We wille examine immune rsponses in vivo and in vitro to both cysts and trophozoites to determine the ability of cyst wall carbohydrates to activate immune cells through MGL2. Finally, bone marrow chimeras will be used to identify specific roles of cytokine production by MGL2+ cells."
"9609392","Our long-term goal is to develop novel antitumor therapies to treat recalcitrant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) by exploiting their unique over-expression of the two-electron, Phase II detoxifying enzyme, NAD(P)H:Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in combination with inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. In NSCLC, NQO1 is elevated 5- to 200-fold above associated normal tissues, while catalase levels are expressed at extremely lower levels in NSCLCs than in associated normal lung (or all other normal) tissue. We showed that unique and novel NQO1 bioactivatable drugs, (e.g., ß- lapachone (ARQ761 in clinical trials), are `bioactivated' by NQO1, resulting in massive H2O2-induced, apyrimidinic/apurinic (AP) site- and DNA single-strand break-mediated hyperactivation of poly(ADP- ribosyl) polymerase 1 (PARP1) that causes dramatic NAD+ losses (Huang et al., Cancer Res, 2012). However, co-administration of a PARP inhibitor dramatically enhances the antitumor activities of these drugs (Huang et al., Cancer Cell, 2016). We have discovered a much more potent NQO1 bioactivatable drug, isobutyldeoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ) that is significantly more synergistic with PARP inhibition that ß-lapachone. We hypothesize that IB-DNQ will be a significantly better drug alone than ARQ761 (ß- lapachone) and result in significantly greater synergistic, NQO1-dependent antitumor activity in combination with PARP inhibitors against NQO1+ NSCLC cells. We propose to complete three specific aims to test this hypothesis.: Aim 1: To define the mechanism of action of PARP inhibition + IB-DNQ synergistic cell death (Yrs 0-5); Aim 2: To define the role of IB-DNQ-induced H2O2-related bystander effect in simultaneous NQO1+ programmed necrosis vs NQO1- apoptosis in matched NSCLC cells (Yrs 0-5); and Aim 3: To define the tumor-selective, NQO1+-dependent antitumor effects of the PARP inhibition + IB-DNQ regimen vs IB-DNQ alone in orthotopic NSCLC xenografts (Yrs 0-5). The aims will be performed using genetically matched NQO1+ vs NQO1- NSCLC cell lines by si/shRNA knockdown of NQO1+ human cancer cell lines and/or forced NQO1 over-expression to match known levels in polymorphic NQO1- human NSCLCs. We will also examine genetically match PARP1 si/shRNA knockdown vs normal NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. We assembled an outstanding research team to explore the metabolic, bystander, and efficacy effects of PARP inhibition + IB-DNQ treatments in orthotopic NSCLC xenograft models in this 5-yr grant. Our results should lead to the development of a clinical trial using this combination in 5 years."
"9539500","Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by muscle contractions that cause debilitating twisting movements and postures. DYT1 dystonia, the most common inherited dystonia, is a severe form of generalized dystonia. DYT1 dystonia is caused by a mutation in the TOR1A gene, resulting in a glutamic acid deletion in the TorsinA protein. Despite the identification of a causal mutation, our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to abnormal movements is incomplete. This limited understanding of pathological mechanisms likely explains, in part, why there are few therapeutics available to treat the disorder. The preferred oral therapeutic for dystonia is the non-selective muscarinic antagonist trihexyphenidyl (THP). While THP is an effective treatment for many patients, its utility is limited by dose-limiting side effects. To date, the mechanism of action of THP in DYT1 dystonia is unknown. One clue to THP?s therapeutic mechanism is the fact that dopamine (DA) dysfunction in the basal ganglia has been consistently implicated in many forms of dystonia. Humans with DYT1 have normal striatal tissue DA but have abnormal DA metabolite ratios. Mice harboring the human DYT1-causing mutation also have normal striatal tissue DA, but reduced extracellular DA in the striatum. This evidence suggests that striatal DA release is reduced in DYT1 mice and humans. Importantly, preliminary data collected in our lab shows that THP effectively enhances striatal extracellular DA concentrations. However, the exact muscarinic receptor subtypes responsible for this effect are unknown. This is a critical piece of information for developing new treatments for dystonia, without the adverse side effect profile of THP. The purpose of this proposal is to determine the muscarinic receptor subtype(s) responsible for the DA-enhancing effect of THP and the improvement of motor symptoms in DYT1 dystonia."

How these cells effectively distinguish between diseased and healthy tissue is one of the key unsolved problems in immunology today. The proposed work seeks to identify the mechanism(s) by which the small adaptor protein CT10 regulator of kinase (Crk), and its phosphorylation, control NK cell activation and inhibition by using both human NK cells and novel NK cell-specific conditional knockout mice. The long-term goal is to use this knowledge and the novel imaging techniques developed herein to uncover the molecular basis of NK cell activation and inhibition, and to develop new treatments for human primary immunodeficiency diseases and chronic diseases such as cancer and viral infection. NK cells kill target cells through the polarized release of lytic granules through a specialized region of cell-cell contact known as the immunological synapse (IS). Through previous studies of the cytotoxic (Liu, D. et al., Immunity, 2009, Cover Article) and inhibitory (Liu, D. et al., Immunity, 2012) IS, we discovered that Crk plays an essential upstream role at the IS, influencing signaling events required for both activation and inhibition. The molecular mechanisms underlying this dual role, however, remain unclear. We hypothesize that receptor-driven, integrin-influenced phosphorylation of Crk acts as a molecular switch, driving a conformational change, which in turn determines Crk's ability to interact with critical downstream signaling molecules and ultimately shapes the actin cytoskeleton into a functional IS. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test these hypotheses via three Specific Aims: 1) Define the precise molecular mechanisms by which Crk-like (CrkL) protein controls NK cell activation and inhibition. The proposed work will bring cutting-edge single molecule imaging technology to the field of NK cell research. Experiments will determine where and when Crk is phosphorylated at the IS, as well as how it interacts with key receptors, signaling molecules, and the actin cytoskeleton; 2) Determine the role of CrkL in NK cells from patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome (pDGS). By studying one of the most common (1 in 3,000 births) immunodeficiency diseases, pDGS (mainly caused by CrkL haploinsufficiency), we will determine how loss of CrkL function affects NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity; 3) Determine whether Crk or CrkL is required for NK function in vivo. Leveraging novel NK cell-specific Crk knockout mice that we have already generated, we will determine Crk's in vivo roles in NK cell-mediated immune responses to viral infection and cancer, including a newly identified role in memory NK cell generation. The proposed work involves key signaling players and regulatory mechanisms and generates a novel model system in which to determine Crk's role as a master regulatory molecule. It is broadly relevant with direct clinical implications for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases, viral infections, and cancer. !"
"9467132","PROJECT SUMMARY: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating syndrome that afflicts more than 300,000 patients in United States alone and has an unacceptably high mortality rate of 35-40%. Currently there are no therapies that address the loss of lung vascular barrier integrity, vascular leakage and alveolar flooding that are critical features of ARDS pathobiology. The PI was the first to demonstrate that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a multifunctional lipid mediator, is an effective therapy for reducing vascular leakage in inflammatory lung injury via ligation of S1P receptor 1 (S1P1), a G-protein-coupled S1P receptor highly expressed in lung vascular endothelial cells (ECs). We demonstrated that S1P1 receptor ligation by S1P or a long-acting phosphonated S1P analogue, TySIPonate, rapidly stimulates a signaling cascade that reorganizes the lung EC cytoskeleton, enhances junctional integrity and decreases lung vascular permeability. Intravenous administration of S1P or TySIPonate reduces murine and canine lung vascular hyper-permeability evoked by ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), bacterial endotoxin (LPS), ischemia/reperfusion, radiation, or traumatic brain death with marked improvement alveolar edema formation. In addition, this STTR team of investigators have demonstrated that lung vascular permeability in ARDS is directly related to excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are key contributors to lung inflammation and injury with a key role for the ROS-generating enzyme, NADPH oxidase (Nox4), a critical mediator of inflammatory lung injury in preclinical models of VILI and ARDS. The goal of this STTR Phase I application is to formulate the ?ReStore Liposome?, an ACE antibody-conjugated liposome that encargoes the combination of TySIPonate and a novel Nox4 small molecule inhibitor (Nox4-smi) (Specific Aim #1). Specific Aim #2 will evaluate in vitro effects of the ReStore Liposome on vascular permeability and ROS generation and Specific Aim #3 will evaluate in vivo effects of the ReStore Liposome in murine preclinical models of ARDS/VILI models of lung injury as a prelude to use as a therapeutic intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality of ARDS in humans. As there is an acute unmet need for novel therapies against ARDS, the academic (University of Arizona)-private biotech partnership (Restore Therapeutics, LLC) will leverage unparalleled expertise in drug delivery, inflammatory lung injury and ROS biochemistry to reduce both lung vascular permeability and ROS burden to effectively attenuate preclinical and human ARDS pathobiology."
"9446305","PROJECT SUMMARY There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the reasons behind the high prevalence of obesity in Samoa, which is among the highest observed across the globe. Over 80% of Samoan adults are overweight or obese, with severe obesity reaching an alarming 33% in women in American Samoa. In a genome-wide association study we recently identified a novel missense variant (p.Arg457Gln, minor allele frequency 0.259) in CREB3 Regulatory Factor (CREBRF) that is highly associated with BMI, with an effect size greater than any known common BMI risk variant. The overall goal of this research project is to gain insight into the metabolic differences responsible for the excess weight gain associated with the CREBRF variant. Based on our observations that overexpression of the missense variant promotes lipid storage and reduces energy substrate oxidation (decreased mitochondrial respiration) in an adipocyte model, our hypothesis is that a lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) is involved. Supporting a relationship between low mitochondrial respiration and low RMR, we recently observed that lower skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration is associated with lower RMR in African American women (AAW). In addition, we recently demonstrated lower intervention induced weight loss in AAW compared to Caucasian women due to a lower RMR, leading to lower energy requirements. Based on these observations, and the fact that the majority of genes known to contribute to human obesity do so primarily by influencing the central control of energy intake and/or expenditure, we propose to determine the role that energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI) play in the increased obesity risk in the Samoan population associated with the CREBRF missense variant. Based on our long-term experience working with obesity and health risks in the Samoan population, combined with our extensive experience assessing energy and substrate metabolism, our research team is ideally positioned to conduct these studies. We propose a longitudinal study to define the impact of the variant on energy balance in human subjects with zero, one, or two copies of the risk allele to address the following three specific aims: 1) to determine the components of EE and substrate metabolism [RMR; TEF, thermic effect of food; total EE; RQ, substrate utilization; and PA, physical activity] using gold standard methods that include doubly-labeled water (DLW), indirect calorimetry, and objective activity monitoring; 2) to determine EI using the gold standard method of DLW intake balance technique; and 3) to determine the relationship between energy metabolism and weight gain by comparing the above energy metabolism parameters and weight gain over 24-36 months. In the applicants opinion the proposed studies will provide novel, and significant insight into the metabolic differences responsible for the excess weight gain in those with the CREBRF variant, which in turn plays a significant role in the extreme prevalence of obesity in Samoa. This research will advance the understanding, prevention, and appropriate treatment of obesity and heart diseases in this high risk population."
"9535572","This application for funding is to support expenses for the 2018 22nd Annual Woods Hole Immunoparasitology Meeting (WHIP), which brings together principal investigators, students and postdoctoral fellows from around the world who are in the field of immunoparasitology. The 2018 meeting will be held on April 15-17, 2018. The annual gathering of scholars in this field was established in 1997 with the intent to provide a collegial meeting place for scientists to exchange ideas in this important field. The meeting averages 125 to 150 participants every year. While there are other meetings where senior principal investigators in this field present their data, the focus of this meeting is to provide a forum where graduate students and postdoctoral fellows present their work to each other and established investigators. The meeting also aims to provide the opportunity to highlight new junior faculty in the field. The location was chosen because of the strong association of the Marine Biology Laboratory (MBL) and the field of parasitology. This relationship began more than 30 years ago with the establishment of the annual summer course, ?Biology of Parasitism,? and with the annual Molecular Parasitology meeting held in the fall at the MBL. It is close to laboratories on the east coast, and accessible via direct flights to Boston from around the world. Over 85% of the talks at the WHIP meeting will be given by either graduate students or post-doctoral fellows, making this a unique meeting in the field. In addition to the oral presentations, all of the students and post-doctoral fellows have the opportunity to present their work in poster sessions. Thus, both in oral talks and poster sessions students and post-doctoral fellows in the field of immunoparasitology gain valuable experience in presenting their data, as well as contacts that will be useful for advancing their science and their careers."
"9466211","Project Summary This project will develop new 3D visualization to improve stent-graft deployment during minimally-invasive endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) by overcoming limitations of 2D x-ray fluoroscopy (?fluoro?). 3D holographic guidance, navigation and control (3D GN&C) will be provided to decrease fluoro radiation dose burden to patients and OR staff during treatment of aortic aneurysms, particularly when deploying stent-grafts within hostile aortic anatomy, with challenges such as short and/or angled landing zones. Radiation-free 3D GN&C that is not limited by a 2D display will enable accurate stent-graft positioning with less irradiation, and thus fewer postoperative complications or need for re-intervention. This innovation will also expand the patient population eligible for EVAR, particularly those with highly unfavorable aortic anatomy, as the demand and utilization of the minimally-invasive approach continues to rise. 3D GN&C for EVAR will be developed and integrated with our computer-assisted surgical platform, the Intra- Operative Positioning System (IOPS). The Guidance subsystem digitally augments the surgical field novel with holographic representations of the virtual stent-graft deployment device within a patient-specific digital aortic model for targeting the aneurysm's landing zone using a modern, self-contained augmented/mixed reality headset. Navigation uses innovative methods to accurately track in real-time the 3D position and orientation of present and next-generation stent-graft delivery devices as well as sensor-coil-equipped wires and catheters in a low-level, safe electromagnetic (EM) field. Control indicators, based on EM tracking data and the guidance plan, also augment the aorta and stent-graft digital models to suggest maneuvers of the delivery device as it approaches the aneurysm?s proximal neck landing zone. The feasibility criteria are to demonstrate that 3D GN&C can be used to decrease fluoro radiation dose while accurately deploying EVAR stent-grafts within challenging aneurysm anatomy using state-of-the art delivery devices. The Specific Aims include evaluation of GN&C usability with a standard scale, a bench study to verify accurate stent-graft deployment within 3D-printed complex aortic morphology, and a preclinical porcine study to prove that, at this stage of R/R&D, 3D GN&C used as an adjunct to fluoro can decrease fluoro radiation dose relative to fluoro alone, with comparable stent-graft deployment accuracy and procedure time. Meeting all acceptance criteria of the Specific Aims will lead to a future clinical study in STTR Phase 2 to demonstrate safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of stent-graft deployment using 3D GN&C. Improved stent- graft placement and overcoming limitations of fluoro will pave the way to realizing the full clinical and economic benefits of EVAR over highly invasive open surgical repair. The ultimate reach goes beyond aneurysmal disease to include aortic dissection, additional endovascular procedures, and other minimally invasive applications to further benefit a broader population of patients and caregivers as well as global healthcare."
"9416116","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."
"9348557","Clinically actionable neoantigens in non-small cell lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among US Veterans as well as the world's leading cause of cancer death. Environmental exposure and tobacco use among Veterans operate together to increase risk. Unleashing the immune response against pulmonary premalignancy could transform therapy and outcomes. Here, we propose to lay the ground work for lung ?cancer interception,? a strategy that seeks to block the progression of premalignancy to invasive cancer. In our preliminary studies we have begun to evaluate the mutational landscape of pulmonary premalignancy and the associated premalignant microenvironment by whole exome DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Remarkably, we find frequent immune-effector cell infiltration as well as evidence of immune suppression in pulmonary premalignancy. These findings lead us to hypothesize that premalignant-associated neoantigens (PANs) are recognized and elicit immune responses at the earliest points of lung adenocarcinoma development. This research will identify neoepitopes that can be targeted before the development of invasive lung cancer, thus shifting the approach to disease interception through immunoprevention and treatment of the very earliest phase of the disease. The specific aims are: 1) To utilize whole exome DNA sequencing (WES) to determine computationally-defined neoantigens in matched sets of primary tumor, premalignant lesions and adjacent histologically normal lung tissues. 2) To identify functionally relevant neoepitopes associated with tumor progression: Two sources of T cells, one from TIL, the other from peripheral blood PD1+ T cells, will be used to identify neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cells. To improve screening efficiency, we will focus on neoantigens shared between pre-malignant lesions and primary tumors that are potentially progression-relevant. Functional assays will be performed to verify the identified neoepitopes. This will lead to patient-tailored neoepitopes for future vaccine or adoptive cell therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 3) To relate the immune contexture to WES-defined mutational landscapes in premalignancy and the associated tumor we will: 3A) Perform quantitative multiplexed immunofluorescent staining of the same specimens utilized in the first two aims to assess the regulators of cell- mediated immunity and to relate this to the mutational landscapes and neoepitopes of the premalignant lesions and tumors, 3B) Evaluate gene expression utilizing a Nanostring panel of 770 immune-related genes and, 3C) Integrate findings from WES, gene expression and tissue immunostaining to define the landscape of adenocarcinoma pulmonary premalignancy. This research seeks to transform the approach to both the prevention and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma by discovery of functional neoepitopes that can be utilized in the development of vaccines and adoptive therapies to intercept disease at the earliest phases. With the advent of screening, many patients are presenting with imaging studies consistent with focal or multifocal premalignancy. As we increase our knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis and natural history of the disease, discovery of critical neoepitopes will facilitate vaccine development for those at the highest risk for progression to invasive lung cancer."
"9466460","PROJECT SUMMARY The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified cyber-security of medical devices as a high priority, and has taken steps to work with medical device manufactures to address this growing concern. Nokomis proposes to develop an embedded, or standalone device to analyze unintended Radio Frequency (RF) emissions to determine changes in device functionality between normally operating medical devices from those under cyber-attack. The proposed noninvasive analysis device would allow medical professionals, and patients, to rapidly identify cyber-attacks in operating devices in a matter of minutes, increasing the ability to address critical system breaches before harm can be done. The noninvasive RF measurement approach is a significant advantage over any other current mitigation technique, as it relies only on the deviations from normal operational states to identify potential problems. Minimally trained medical professionals, as well as patients with devices at home, would be enabled to use the embedded or standalone device and potentially identify device risks prior to device failure. Nokomis? proposed monitoring device would enable rapid analysis of a widespread array of medical devices for functional capabilities in a noninvasive, and easy to use, system that would provide many benefits to patients and medical professionals. The proposed device will utilize unintended RF emissions that are casually related to electronic functionality on medical devices to distinguish abnormal operating conditions. Using Nokomis? ultra-sensitive sensor, the deviation in spectral content can be automatically detected to allow an alarm for the user to take action to mitigate damage from a cyber-attack. The proposed research in Phase I will focus on (Aim 1) characterizing a specific medical device in normal operational mode as well as in an altered state under cyber-attack. Differences in spectral content will be used to create detection algorithms (Aim 2) that will be tested in a benchtop prototype system to demonstrate cyber-attack detection capabilities (Aim 3). Successful results from this program will advance the mission of the agency to assure the safety of medical devices to protect the security of human patients that require medical care."
"9379801","DESCRIPTION         This study will explicitly compare the effects of a 12-week progressive exercise training program on 1) the clinical symptoms of chronic pain and PTSD, 2) pain threshold and tolerance, and 3) anti-stress, anti- nociceptive neurohormones such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and allopregnanolone/pregnanolone (ALLO) in veterans with chronic pain/PTSD compared to healthy comparison participants. The revised study design includes a baseline cardiopulmonary exercise assessment (CPX) that will inform the exercise prescription for a 12-week progressive exercise training program, comprised of three 30-45 minute exercise sessions per week (walking or running, depending on the ability/capacity of the participant). Exercise sessions will be initially supervised by an exercise physiologist in the Clinical Studies Unit (CSU) at the VA Boston Healthcare System and then each participant will transition into the home. Weekly telephone calls by the PI will provide additional motivational support and assistance with problem solving. Implementation of the prescribed exercise regimen will also be supported by the use of heart rate and actigraph monitors programmed for the participant to achieve their prescribed heart rate range (HRR). Finally, an endpoint maximum load exercise assessment will occur at week 13 in order to track measurable change for both psychological and neurobiological factors and to delineate their impact on pain indices and PTSD symptomatology. Both maximum load exercise tests will be performed in accordance with guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology. Measures of pain, pain tolerance (via the cold pressor test) will be implemented 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after exercise testing as well as at a midpoint check-in at which self-report questionnaires will also be repeated. Based on the PI's earlier research, the role of exercise motivation and self-efficacy on changes in perceived pain and pain tolerance will be correlated with changes in NPY and ALLO levels, pre and post exercise. It is anticipated that differences in biological responses to aerobic and anaerobic exercise between healthy participants and those with chronic pain/PTSD will predict differences in the psychological and pain-reducing benefits of aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Once identified, such factors could be augmented by modification of the exercise regimen in order to help enhance the ant-stress hormone levels for the pain/PTSD population and experience clinically significant reductions in their symptoms. In order to obtain sufficient power as well as accounting for an expected drop-out rate of 18-20%, the proposed recruitment is 30 participants per condition (total of 60 participants). Data from this pilot work will be used to compute effect sizes in support of a future clinical trial incorporating individually prescribed exercise regimens and a motivationally based exercise behavior change intervention aimed at reducing pain and PTSD symptoms in our Veterans. Advanced education and training is sought by this CDA-2 award applicant in four broad areas: 1) psychophysiology of chronic pain and PTSD with a sub-focus on sex differences, 2) the neurobiology of chronic stress, PTSD, and pain, 3) exercise physiology and 4) the neuropsychology and neurobiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The combination of didactic and experiential training in these areas will serve the PI's long-term goal of becoming an independent scientist/practitioner in the VA focused on development of improved treatments for health conditions co-morbid with PTSD such as chronic pain and mild TBI. In the shorter-term, this CDA-2 will allow the PI to develop a more effective, motivationally based, exercise behavior change protocol that fosters long- term exercise compliance in patients with chronic pain/PTSD. This intervention will be used as an adjunct to cognitive interventions for these disorders to be further developed and studied via a larger VA, NIH, or DOD- funded grant for which the PI will apply in years 4-5 of the CDA2."
"9593640","Project Summary/Abstract Bi-directional vesicular transport is vital in all eukaryotic cells to deliver proteins to secretory organelles and the cell surface, and for release from the cell. It is estimated that 30% of the mammalian proteomes must traffic the secretory pathway. GBF1 (Golgi localized Brefeldin A-sensitive Factor1) is a key regulator of retrograde traffic from the Golgi to the ER, and GBF1 activity is required for the establishment and maintenance of the secretory pathway. GBF1 belongs to a family of large Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) and is an enzyme that facilitates GDP/GTP exchange on the ARF subfamily of small Ras-like GTPases. GBF1-mediated ARF activation is required for the formation of retrograde COPI vesicles, and GBF1 represents an upstream regulator of COPI vesicle formation as it dictates the time and site of vesicle formation by restricting ARF activation. Yet, despite the critical importance of GBF1 in cellular homeostasis, we remain ignorant of how GBF1 itself is regulated in cells. Specifically, we do not know how cells signal to GBF1 to ?notify? it of a cellular need for retrograde traffic and what mechanisms ensure that GBF1 initiates COPI vesicle formation only at the right time and the right place. This proposal aims to illuminate this enigma. We will test the hypothesis that cells have mechanisms to inhibit GBF1 activity to prevent spurious ARF activation, but release such inhibition in a time and site-restricted manner in response to a signaling pathway that indicates retrograde traffic demand. Our goal is to define how cells translate their need for ARF activation and membrane transport into space- and time-restricted GBF1 function. We propose 3 specific aims to identify the processes and signaling pathways that regulate GBF1 function in an essential traffic routing in all cells, retrograde COPI traffic that is vital for the homeostasis of the secretory pathway. In Aim 1, we will identify the mechanisms that selectively target GBF1 to Golgi membranes by identifying the intrinsic targeting information within GBF1 and the membrane components that mark membrane sites for GBF1 recruitment. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms that regulate GBF1 catalytic activity at the membrane by assessing the role of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) in regulating GBF1 catalytic activity. In Aim 3, we will determine the signaling pathways that coordinate GBF1 function with the need for COPI traffic by defining the role of KDEL-R activation and the PKA and SFK pathways on GBF1 membrane association and catalytic activity. GBF1 is ubiquitously expressed and critically important to cell and organismal health; GBF1 depletion from cultured cells causes death and a mouse or Drosophila knockout is embryonic lethal. GBF1 is also important in pathological contexts since it is essential for migration of glioblastoma cells and for replication of human pathogenic enteroviruses. Our studies will provide critical new knowledge of GBF1 regulation in basic cellular physiology and will inform strategies for the design of therapeutic intervention to control GBF1-mediated events in pathological contexts."
"9634996","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Each year, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections contribute to over 8 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) and nearly 2 million deaths. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a first-line sterilizing anti-tubercular drug that is anticipated to be an irreplaceable component of future TB treatment regimens. Despite more than 60 years of clinical use of PZA, the mechanistic basis for its activity has yet to be resolved. Previous studie have demonstrated that PZA is a pro-drug that is converted to the active form of pyrazinoic acid (POA) by the M. tuberculosis amidase PncA, and that loss of function mutations in pncA account for the vast majority of PZA resistance. In addition, while PZA is only conditionally bacteriostatic for M. tuberculosis in laboratory culture, this drug mediates sterilization of bacili in humans and in animal models of infection. Thus, there is an as yet undefined host-dependent activity involved in potentiation of PZA action on M. tuberculosis. Our long-term goal for this project is to define the mechanistic basis for PZA action against M. tuberculosis. It is known that POA, but not PZA, forms complexes with several divalent metals involved in biocatalysis and oxidative stress, yet the relevance of this interaction for PZA action has not been explored. We are using a multidisciplinary approach to address the hypothesis that PZA treatment has a profound impact on metal homeostasis and oxidative stress in M. tuberculosis. These studies will shed new light on the poorly understood mode of action of PZA and stand to explain the dichotomous outcome of M. tuberculosis PZA exposure in culture versus in a mammalian system. Resolving the basis for PZA action will guide the discovery of novel agents with a conserved or improved action against M. tuberculosis to counter drug resistance."
"9447878","Project Summary/Abstract  Reducing advanced breast cancer mortality requires urgent development of better drugs and improved therapeutic strategies; however, new drug development is extremely time-consuming and costly. With the explosive growth of large-scale cancer genomic and phenotypic data (e.g., the Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]) and publicly available high-throughput screening data for thousands of small molecules (many of which have already received regulatory approval for at least one medical condition), computational drug repositioning or repurposing holds great potential for precision medicine and may provide tools to significantly improve breast cancer treatment and outcomes.  Our hypothesis is that optimal therapeutic choices can be identified for hard to treat breast cancers by applying transcriptome-based drug sensitivity prediction methods. Our long term goal is to identify and validate the efficacy of existing drugs in hard to treat breast cancers, namely triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Toward this goal, this proposal contains two specific aims to develop, apply, and improve methods to predict drug sensitivity (either as a single agent or in combination). We will also validate these predictions in additional large-scale cancer genomic datasets and translate the results using cell based and in vivo (mouse) models of TNBC and MBC. In Aim 1, we will focus on identifying effective drugs as monotherapy, while Aim 2 is to identify and validate optimal therapeutic combinations.  Our study is significant because it will accelerate the development of novel therapies for hard to treat breast cancers by repurposing existing drugs, thus avoiding the lengthy and risky new drug development process. The ability to tailor therapy for specific disease subtypes and identification and validation of new drug indications will provide valuable therapeutic options in the battle against TNBC and MBC, and subsequently reduce their associated mortality. Our proposed research is innovative in both the methodologies employed and their applications, as our transcriptome-based drug sensitivity prediction represents a paradigms shift in drug sensitivity prediction; furthermore, we are applying these novel prediction approaches to patient tumor data not only for biomarker discovery in order to tailor individual therapy, but also for drug repurposing. The ability to bring biomarker discovery and drug repurposing together will present a new opportunity for cancer therapy, as the whole genome expression profile of a tumor will be used to provide optimal therapeutic options in different cancers, and many ?old? drugs can find a new purpose in improving cancer treatment outcomes."
"9478171","Project Summary Application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to the flow analysis and design of complex medical devices such as prosthetic heart valves and ventricular assist devices is by now standard practice in the medical devices research and development community. However, a recent controlled study by the FDA has demonstrated the limitations of traditional CFD in predicting laminar-transitional-turbulent flows of relevance to cardiovascular devices. In particular, no statistical turbulence model used in the medical devices community benchmarked uniformly successfully against experimental data. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) was recommended in this study for future simulations. To address the recommendation of the FDA panel to use LES in future simulations we propose to develop an advanced new-generation CFD for low-Reynolds-number turbulent flows of relevance to the NIH mission, using (1) a high-order Eulerian vorticity transport method for LES in the boundary layer region, and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) in the immediate vicinity of the boundary; and (2) an existing meshless Lagrangian Vortex Method (LVM) for LES of the large scale flow away from the boundary layer. The velocity evaluations, which constitute roughly 80% of the computational cost, will be parallelized on multicore CPUs and multi-GPUs. The Specific Aims of the project are: Specific Aim 1: To develop a compact high-order finite volume method for laminar flow simulation via the vorticity transport equation (VTE); to accelerate the velocity evaluations on multicore CPUs and multi-GPUs; and to rigorously validate the laminar flow code using, among others, the FDA Critical Path problem #1 (nozzle), as well as DNS of steady and pulsatile stenotic flow. Specific Aim 2: To develop a dynamic Subgrid-Scale (SGS) model in the context of VTE and tailored for transitional flow; and to validate the high-order finite volume code for turbulent flow using, among others, the FDA Critical Path problem #1 (nozzle), as well as steady and pulsatile stenotic flow. Specific Aim 3: To finalize the development of the proposed hybrid code for LES of low-Reynolds-number turbulent flow by coupling the high-order Eulerian and Lagrangian vortex element solvers, accurately and stably; and to validate the final product using a series of benchmarks, including the FDA Critical Path problems #1 (nozzle) and #2 (pump), as well as an actual blood pump; e.g., the HeartMate II. Specific Aim 4: To implement a system for successful documentation, dissemination, and maintenance of the software, and to accommodate collaborative research; and to develop interfaces to mainstream CFD to ensure interoperability and seamless migration to the propsed technology. Long-Term Impact: At present, application of traditional CFD and statistical turbulence models is limited to the study of device performance in terms of relative trends. That is, CFD is not yet a truly predictive design and analysis tool, at least in the case of cardio-device design, which involves highly complex unsteady flow with multiple coexisting laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. The proposed high-order hybrid DNS-LES method is designed to be a predictive tool that avoids ad hoc model constants especially within the boundary layer, which is a key source of shear stress and blood damage. The proposed technology will fundamentally alter how the medical devices community will use CFD in future. The long-term significant impact of this research and technology maturation project is a CFD software that (1) is incredibly easy to learn and use, as it obviates the often tedious and error prone volumetric meshing process; (2) can be used reliably as a predictive tool thanks to the absence of turbulence models with ad hoc fudge factors, which must invariably be calibrated and validated for each new flow problem; and (3) can be run on a desktop at order-of-magnitude faster turn-around times, reducing month-long product design cycles to just days, thanks to advanced algorithms and accelerated computing on commodity multicore CPUs and multi-GPUs."
"9439642","Project Summary/Abstract  There is an unmet demand for functional characterization of variants observed in clinical DNA sequencing. This is evidenced by sequencing tests frequently reporting `variants of uncertain significance', information that cannot be acted on clinically. Of the approaches to characterize mutations in the absence of genetic evidence, all current methods have limitations ? namely, they aren't scalable to the large number of variants being sequenced, or they have inherent limits to their accuracy, a key one of which is that variants are removed from their genomic contexts to be assayed. This project aims to significantly improve experimental variant testing by using a novel genome editing method. This technique, called saturation editing, enables functional testing of large numbers of variants in multiplex, each in their endogenous genomic location. Through application to two genes in which mutations cause either chemotherapy resistance or oncogenesis, the method will yield powerful and accurate data for thousands of variants potentially playing key roles in disease.  The first goal will be to generate functional scores for every variant across the coding sequence of the HPRT1 gene for causing resistance to the leukemia drug, 6-thioguanine. This work will provide a richly informative database of variant effects as measured in the genome that can be compared to data from HPRT1- deficient patients to evaluate accuracy. Next, by extending this assay to study over 1,000 mutations in non- coding regions of the same gene, the potential for loss-of-function mutations in non-coding sequences of the genome will be systematically interrogated for the first time. This will provide insights into why clinical sequencing sometimes fails to find coding mutations despite knowledge of which gene is mutated. Finally, saturation editing will be implemented to assay BRCA1 variants for their affects on the homology-directed repair pathway. Experiments will be targeted to the RING domain of BRCA1, where there is a high occurrence of pathogenic missense mutations, most of which have been incompletely characterized. The ability of BRCA1 variants to promote homology-directed repair accurately predicts whether a BRCA1 variant maintains tumor- suppressor function or not. Through this study, more interpretable functional scores for hundreds of BRCA1 variants will be generated, potentially informing clinical decision-making. Collectively, these experiments will generate valuable data for the cancer community, while also establishing a new approach for scalable and accurate functional testing of variants in genes relevant to cancer."
"9492890","Project Summary/Abstract DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) can be caused by oxidative stress, or intermediate products of various DNA metabolisms including DNA replication and damage repair. Unrepaired oxidative DNA damage and SSBs may result in replication fork collapse or transcription machinery failure. Oxidative DNA damage and SSBs are critical challenges to genomic stability and can lead to tumorigenesis when they are not repaired quickly or properly. Current understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying checkpoint signaling and regulatory mechanisms in response to oxidative DNA damage and SSBs is limited or indirect because of the lack of feasible experimental systems. Whereas APE1 (AP endonuclease 1) is known for its critical functions in base excision repair and transcriptional regulation, it is currently unknown whether APE1 plays an essential role in DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. Our published work and substantial preliminary data suggest that APE1 is essential for activating the ATR-dependent DDR pathway in oxidative stress, that a distinct ATR-Chk1 checkpoint response is activated by a defined plasmid-based SSB structure, and that APE1 associates with ATRIP and TopBP1. Our major hypothesis is that APE1 plays an vital role in checkpoint signaling in response to oxidative stress and SSBs. To test this directly, our specific aims include: (1) to determine whether APE1 plays an important role in the initiation of SSB end resection in the 3'-5 direction via its exonuclease activity for the SSB signaling; (2) to determine how APE1 interacts with ATRIP in DDR pathway, and (3) to determine how TopBP1 is regulated to activate the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint signaling and whether the role of APE1 in DDR is conserved in pancreatic cancer cells. We have established two complementary approaches to study checkpoint signaling pathway: (1) hydrogen peroxide-induced multiple SSBs randomly distributed on chromatin in a replicating Xenopus LSS system, and (2) plasmid-based site-specific SSB structures in a nonreplicating Xenopus HSS system. Using innovative biochemical and structure-function analysis in Xenopus egg extracts, we will demonstrate how oxidative DNA damage and SSBs are recognized and processed by APE1 in coordination with ATRIP and TopBP1 to regulate checkpoint signaling. We will also validate our findings from Xenopus egg extract system in mammalian cells including pancreatic cancer cells. The anticipated outcomes of this research project will help us better understand how genome stability is maintained in cellular response to oxidative DNA damage and SSBs. All together, this research project will advance our scientific knowledge conceptually on how cancers develop, and open avenues to new therapeutic strategies, especially for pancreatic cancer."
"9408661","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ? PROJECT 1 - BIOMARKERS OF EPILEPTOGENESIS AFTER EXPERIMENTAL TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY Development of anti-epileptogenic (AEG) therapies for patients with the highest risk of epilepsy is seriously impeded by the lack of biomarkers for epileptogenesis. One critical obstacle in biomarker development is the heterogeneity of patient populations with acquired causes of epilepsy like TBI. Our objective is to discover plasma molecular, electrophysiological, and imaging markers which will diagnose epileptogenesis in a clinically relevant model of TBI. We will model the temporal lobe endophenotype of TBI, the most common injury location in humans with post-traumatic epilepsy, by inducing TBI in the lateral temporal cortex in rats using fluid-percussion injury (FPI), which results in epilepsy in about 50% of rats in a one-year follow-up. We will apply common data elements and multicenter study designs to obtain standardized data for a statistically powered study. Specific Aim 1 will investigate whether the distribution, spatial extent, and temporal evolution of changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) during up to 12-months follow-up will provide biomarkers of post- traumatic epileptogenesis. We will perfuse the animals for ex vivo MRI analysis, and save the brains in biobank for histological analysis. In Specific Aim 2 we will assess microstructural changes in hippocampal and thalamocortical pathways using magnetization transfer, phase contrast/susceptibility weighted imaging, diffusion tensor, and diffusion tractography magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during a 6-month follow-up after TBI. We will assess whether specific temporal pathologies can be used as biomarkers for post-traumatic epileptogenesis, and whether their sensitivity and specificity will be increased by extra-temporal pathologies. In Specific Aim 3 we will collect blood samples from the same rats at different time points for analysis of molecular biomarkers. Our hypothesis-driven approach will investigate 15 plasma proteins which signal about neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, axonal/dendritic injury, and metabolic disturbances. In our unbiased approach, we will perform plasma microRNA-seq to discover microRNAs which predict epileptogenesis. We will analyze the dataset further using bioinformatics tools to discover novel candidate biomarkers and mechanisms of epileptogenesis. Data analysis will be conducted using existing methods available on-site and methods available and developed in the Informatics and Analytics Core (IAC). We will combine results from blood tests, EEG, and structural MRI, and assess the biomarker value of different parameters alone and in combination using logistic regression analysis, principal component analysis, and receiver observed curves, in addition to novel computational and graphing techniques developed by the IAC. We will validate the best biomarkers discovered in Project 1 in an independent animal cohort in Project 2 and in human TBI cohort in Project 3. Our study will generate extensive molecular, electrophysiological, and imaging datasets which will be available for use in the IAC. As deliverables, our study will provide the first biomarker(s) for epileptogenesis which can be used for therapy development to combat epileptogenesis after experimental and human TBI. !"
"9604545","Project Summary The prevention of excessive drinking and related negative consequences by underage drinkers and college students is an important objective for Healthy People 2020. This resubmission application is aimed at extending an R01 grant (R01 AA019511) in response to PA-15-295, ?Screening and brief alcohol interventions in underage and young adult populations (R01).? The previous R01 focused on methodological developments for pooling and analyzing individual participant data (IPD) from 24 studies (N = 24,336 at baseline; 12,630 randomized) to examine the efficacy of brief motivational interventions (BMIs) for college students. Deploying newly developed methods to combine and analyze IPD, the resulting large, pooled data set showed that BMIs for college students may not be as powerful as prior reviews suggest, pointing to the need to better understand why some interventions succeed while others fail. Our previous research on IPD was limited in terms of its study-level sample size (24 studies) as well as its population representation. Moreover, recently published traditional meta-analyses have found overall intervention effects, contradicting our findings. The proposed research expands and enhances our earlier work by using the cutting-edge methodology with a comprehensive set of data with the end goal of providing an authoritative summary of the alcohol intervention field for adolescents and young adults. Beyond simply focusing on the omnibus question of ?any effect,? our research is aimed at testing which interventions are better and exploring how to individualize intervention strategies to meet different needs of the individual for greater benefit (i.e., precision medicine). We will combine aggregated data (e.g., means, SDs) from approximately 350 independent brief alcohol intervention trials and IPD from 49 trials. Of these, aggregated data from 303 samples and IPD from 24 studies have already been secured with the support of two separate R01s (AA020286 to Tanner-Smith and AA019511 to Mun). We will maximize the scale and depth of the existing clinical data via the following state-of-the-art synthesis approaches: network meta-analysis (meta-regression) and multivariate meta-analysis, and their extensions for IPD. In a major extension of prior work, the proposed investigation will (1) respect the natural hierarchy of the data (i.e., participants nested within studies); (2) simultaneously accommodate multiple interventions (networks instead of any two pairs of interventions); (3) explain effect heterogeneity (i.e., strong to weak intervention effects) by examining factors at the individual- and study-level, as well as cross-level; and (4) allow joint analysis of multiple related outcomes (e.g., alcohol use and problems) by borrowing strength from one another. Our transdisciplinary team of leading experts, many of whom led the earlier, successful research will generate new evidence that will be ?scalable? so that new trial data can straightforwardly be accommodated to evaluate their relative efficacy compared to existing interventions. This research can help establish future research priority areas, guide the design of future trials, and develop recommendations for practitioners? clinical practice."
"9459398","Abstract Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is genetic disorder characterized by degeneration of elastic fibers that leads to dermatologic, ocular and cardiovascular abnormalities, involving progressive calcification of the soft tissues. Calcification can occur within the heart muscle, particularly after injury, and predisposes these patients to cardiac dysfunction or sudden death from ventricular arrhythmias. PXE is caused by mutations in the ATP Binding Cassette C6 transporter gene (ABCC6) yet little is understood how deficiency of ABCC6 induces ectopic calcification in multiple soft tissues. Calcification of soft tissues is thought to be an active process where bone forming osteoblast-like cells are recruited to the affected tissue and cause mineralization of the extracellular matrix, a process analogous to cancellous bone formation. However the nature of the cells contributing to soft tissue calcification in the heart and other organs in PXE and how this is regulated by ABCC6 are unknown. The Deb lab has recently shown that cardiac fibroblasts are not terminally differentiated and presents preliminary data to suggest that fibroblast adopt osteogenic fates and directly contribute to heart muscle calcification in a mouse model of PXE. The Lusis lab was one of the first labs to identify and clone ABCC6 as an important gene regulating soft tissue calcification. In this multi PI proposal, the Deb and Lusis labs interrogate the role of fibroblast plasticity in directly contributing to heart muscle calcification in ABCC6 deficient animals, investigate i) spatio-temporal dynamics of fibroblast-osteoblast transitions ii) biochemical mechanisms regulating fibroblast mediated calcification and ?iii) the physiologic significance of fibroblast mediated calcification. We provide preliminary data that mechanisms regulating calcification in ABCC6 deficiency are dysregulated in other common causes of ectopic calcification such as human heart valve calcification and investigate strategies to inhibit final common pathways mediating ectopic calcification, regardless of the underlying pathology."

In addition to constructing recombinant viruses, Core C will perform genome-wide sequencing of viral mutants. Building upon years of experience in making a complete set of KSHV miRNA deletion mutants, our group has developed and implemented techniques for making bacmid-derived mutants in both KSHV and MHV68, and will readily extend this to EBV."
"9510443","Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread apicomplexan parasite that causes life-threatening disease in neonates and immunocompromised individuals. T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites use a unique form of gliding motility to invade into and escape from cells of their hosts and to disseminate throughout the body during infection. It is well established that T. gondii MyosinA (TgMyoA) plays an important role in parasite motility, and parasites lacking TgMyoA are completely avirulent. How TgMyoA and the proteins with which it interacts work together to drive motility is therefore a fundamentally important question. Recent data have called into question the current ?linear motor? model of motility and suggested the existence of a parallel, non- TgMyoA-based motility mechanism.  This project will fill in a key gap in our understanding of parasite motility by determining the directionality of the forces generated by a parasite as it moves through the extracellular matrix. Capitalizing on our experience in high-speed imaging and analysis of parasite 3D motility and on our longstanding collaboration with mathematician Mark Rould, the Specific Aims of the project are to: (1) Develop 3D matrix deformation mapping methods to visualize the directionality of the forces moving parasites exert on the surrounding extracellular matrix and (2) Use 3D matrix deformation mapping to test key predictions of the linear motor model of T. gondii motility and to determine how disruption of the motor machinery affects the ability of the parasite to generate force.  Motility plays a central role in the life cycle and virulence of T. gondii, yet the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. Understanding how the parasite generates force and determining whether it can use alternative mechanisms in the absence of TgMyoA will be critical to developing new, effective drugs that target parasite motility. The innovative methods developed here will be used to test key tenets of the current model of parasite motility, bring clarity to the role of TgMyoA and enable new approaches to analyzing motility based on the parasite's ability to generate force. Since the proteins and mechanisms underlying motility appear to be conserved among apicomplexans, the new mechanistic insights generated by this study and the future work it enables are likely to be directly relevant not just to T. gondii, but to other apicomplexan parasites as well. ."
"9408659","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ? PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT CORE - EPIBIOS4RX The overarching goal of the Public Engagement Core is to actively engage voluntary organizations with the EpiBioS4Rx CWOW in public outreach and knowledge transfer for the development of effective strategies to successfully design and complete clinical research studies, including future trials of prevention therapy in epilepsy. The scientific premise of EpiBioS4Rx is: Epileptogenesis after traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be prevented with specific treatments; the identification of relevant biomarkers and performance of rigorous preclinical trials will permit the future design and performance of economically feasible full-scale clinical trials of antiepileptogenic therapies. The Public Engagement Core aims at creating a consortium of consumers and consumer organizations, scientific (professional) societies, health organizations and EpiBioS4Rx investigators to assist with public outreach and facilitate interactions and communication among our partners to effectively promote participatory action research. To achieve a solid grounding between concept, practice and action, we have recruited several constituencies in the planning and decision making processes. A unique feature of our proposed patient engagement program is the preventative nature of this study. We are planning to involve patients who have suffered TBI and are considered to be at risk of developing epilepsy, but do not currently have the condition. Therefore, we are seeking patient involvement in the development of recruitment strategies for clinical trials for epileptogenesis, to which the patients may or may not develop. Subsequently, the Public Engagement Core will involve both consumers (actual patients and their caregivers) and consumer groups in identifying effective strategies to design large-scale interventional clinical trials of antiepileptogenic therapies in TBI and committed to effective recruitment and retention. The ultimate objective of the Core is to create a universal shared resource for epilepsy involving consumers and consumer organizations that could be used to design and execute large-scale intervention studies."
"9576383","A central goal of neuroscience is to clarify how the brain transforms sensory inputs into perceptual representations. Curiously, even though odor stimuli are at the heart of goal-directed behavior, including feeding, mating, and maternal bonding (for both human and non-human species), very little is known about the neural transformations that create olfactory percepts out of airborne molecules. Because most odors are complex mixtures of different molecules, an important challenge of olfactory systems is to re-assemble these parts into coherent perceptual wholes, or ?objects,? that are perceptually anchored to their original sources in the environment. Understanding how the human brain encodes, discriminates, and categorizes olfactory objects is a key research focus in our lab. An advantage to studying humans is that they can talk and provide ratings of their sensory experiences, offering a highly tractable way to relate brain activity patterns directly to perception. In work proposed here, we will leverage our current strengths in olfactory psychophysics, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and pattern-based imaging analysis with new methodological, experimental, and computational approaches to dissect the components of odor perceptual processing at the behavioral and neural levels. By effectively deconstructing either the odor stimulus or the olfactory system, we will be able to gain unique insights into the functional organization of odor object coding and recognition. Specific studies will explore where conscious perception of an odor arises in the human brain, how higherorder regions contribute to perceptual coding and categorization, and whether the brain has access to individual elements of a behaviorally salient food odor. Complementary studies will investigate the role of familiarity, reward learning, and levels of prior belief on the emergence and modulation of odor object patterns and connectivity in olfactory and non-olfactory brain areas. Together these experiments will bring novel understanding of how the human brain overcomes the challenges of recognizing odor objects, and will highlight the key regions that are instrumental in supporting odor perception. In addition, our findings should usefully inform the human neurobiology of the other sensory systems, and should contribute valuable basic information that could help guide development of future diagnostic strategies in patients with Alzheimer?s disease and Parkinson?s disease, which are associated with olfactory perceptual deficits in their earliest stages."
"9349919","Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant international public health threat, particularly for US military personnel who are often deployed to areas of high TB prevalence. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a respiratory pathogen spread via inhalation of infectious airborne particles. Most infected individuals develop protective immunity that serves to contain the organism, but approximately 10% will eventually develop active TB. The localization of mycobacteria-specific CD4+ T cells to the lung appears to be critical to protection against Mtb infection, and may not be optimized by current TB vaccination with intradermal (ID) M. bovis BCG. Human studies using lung cells obtainable by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) provide a means to assess local immune responses to Mtb that may be uniquely relevant to evaluating novel TB vaccines. The distinct nature of local immunity within the lung has been further emphasized by recent murine studies demonstrating that respiratory infection is followed by the development of CD4+ memory T cells that are localized to the lung parenchyma and do not rejoin the general circulation. These tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) display a distinct phenotype, and also show increased capacity to protect against respiratory infection with Mtb. The use of intravenous (IV) injection of pan-leukocyte antibodies to identify T cells that are not in communication with the vasculature has provided a means to sort pulmonary TRM from vascular-associated memory cells. This intriguing approach has not yet been applied to clarifying the significance of BAL-based studies of immunity to Mtb; this step is critical, however, to the ultimate application of these insights to human studies. The overall goal of the current proposal is to clarify the mechanisms by which CD4+ T cells within BAL differ from and interact with other lung CD4+ T-cell populations to mediate lymphocyte recruitment to the lung and, ultimately, protection against respiratory challenge with Mtb. Our research team is uniquely qualified to address these issues, as it includes investigators with experience in bronchoscopy-based studies of human immunity to Mtb (Richard Silver, PI), murine assessments of immunity to Mtb (W. Henry Boom, Consultant) and optimization of immune assays involving lung cells from both mice and humans (Tracey Bonfield, Co-investigator). We will also greatly benefit from the involvement of a pioneer in the application of TRM methodology to the study of Mtb infection (Daniel Barber of NIAID, Consultant). Our studies will utilize a murine model of Mtb infection in which lung homogenate cells stained by IV injection (?IV+ T cells?) associated with the lung vasculature are sorted from T cells that cannot be labeled in this manner. These ?IV- T cells? predominantly display a TRM phenotype and are retained within the parenchyma. We will apply this approach to evaluate the interactions of IV- and IV+ lung CD4+ T cells and to clarify their relationship to BAL CD4+ T cells in mice. Parallel human studies will utilize both baseline BAL cells and unique samples obtained by modeling recall responses to Mtb protein antigens using bronchoscopic segmental antigen challenge with purified protein derivative of Mtb (PPD). These approaches will be integrated to address the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine the mechanisms by which mycobacteria-specific CD4+ T cells in BAL are phenotypically distinct from IV- and IV+ lung homogenate CD4+ T-cell populations; 2) To determine the mechanisms by which BAL CD4+ T-cells interact with IV- and IV+ CD4+ lung T-cell populations to recruit additional T cells to the lung parenchyma and airways; 3) To determine the mechanisms by which BAL and lung parenchymal CD4+ T cells interact to mediate protection against respiratory infection with virulent M. tuberculosis."
"9427491","Project Summary / Abstract  Neuropathic pain (NeuP) affects >16 million Americans and results in considerable impairment in quality of life. Available medications fail to adequately relief pain in the majority of NeuP patients; moreover, efficacious drugs such as opioids have major safety concerns. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Serotonergic 5-HT3 receptors (5-HT3R) have been identified as a promising pharmacological target in NeuP. After peripheral nerve damage, overexpression of 5-HT3 receptors in spinal cord neurons can shift the character of descending serotonergic modulation from inhibitory to facilitatory, thus contributing to ongoing pain. Intrathecal 5-HT3R antagonists alleviate evoked hypersensitivity in animal NeuP models, but the analgesic effects are inconsistent with systemic administration of these drugs in patients with neuropathic pain. Our preliminary data suggest that efflux transporters such as the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) limit the central nervous system (CNS) exposure of 5-HT3R antagonists, thus preventing analgesia following systemic administration.  We hypothesize that if 5-HT3R antagonists were to reach adequate CNS concentrations, they would be efficacious in relieving neuropathic pain. To validate 5-HT3R as a clinically-relevant drug target in neuropathic pain, we plan to undertake the following translational approach: 1) We will characterize the CNS disposition of model 5-HT3R antagonsits ondansetron and granisteron in a rat model, and determine the effect of efflux transporters such as Pgp on their CNS disposition. This will be done by a) determining drug bio-disposition in rat plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as in brain and spinal cord (whole tissue analysis and micro-dialysis), and b) utilizing genetic and pharmacological knockouts of Pgp transporters to determine the effects of efflux transporters on drug disposition. 2) We will determine the role of Pgp efflux on ondansetron disposition in human CNS. This will be done by detemining the time-course of plasma and CSF concentrations of IV ondansetron in healthy subjects, with and without tariquidar? a selective inhibitor of Pgp transporters. Analgesia will be assessed in an experimental pain model, and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling will be implemented to predict ondansetron concentrations in human brain and spinal cord, based on combined results from animal and human studies. 3) We will determine the effect of adequately CNS-penetrating ondansetron on neuropathic pain. In an experimental cross-over study in NeuP patients, analgesia will be compared when ondansetron is administered with and without tariquidar. In an exploratory mechanism-based analysis, we will determine the association between the extent of individual descending pain facilitation and the analgesic response to 5-HT3R blockade.  We expect the results to successfully determine the mechanisms limiting CNS exposure of 5-HT3R antagonists, and to demonstrate that by bypassing these mechanisms, 5-HT3R antagonists can alleviate neuropathic pain, particularly in patients with sensory phenotype suggesting descending facilitation."
"9493119","Project Summary Current clinical practice in screening tests involves subjective interpretation of patients' test results such as mammograms by trained experts. Substantial variability is often reported between radiologists' visual classifications of breast images, impacting the accuracy and consistency of common screening tests including mammography. Factors related to patients and raters and the technology itself may impact experts' ratings of breast cancer and density, an important predictor of breast cancer. However, the study of accuracy and consistency between radiologists' ratings in large-scale cancer longitudinal screening studies is challenging due to the ordinal nature of the classifications and many experts each contributing ratings. Newly emerging processes including automated 3-D procedures provide exciting potential for estimating breast density in routine clinical settings. Currently very few statistical approaches and summary measures exist to model the consistency and accuracy between several radiologists' ordinal ratings. Further, few methods can investigate the influence of patient and radiologist characteristics, the use of automated procedures and comparison of the different technologies upon accuracy and consistency. Our goals are to develop new statistical methods based upon generalized linear mixed models and latent variable models to study accuracy and consistency amongst many experts in large-scale screening studies. Our approach can flexibly accommodate many experts' ratings and other factors to examine their influence on consistency and accuracy. We will derive novel model-based summary measures of agreement and accuracy. We will implement our new statistical methods in recent large-scale breast imaging studies. A key strength of our proposed research is to provide medical researchers with a flexible modeling approach and novel summary measures that utilize all the data simultaneously, where conclusions can be drawn about the consistency between typical experts and patients in the populations, greatly increasing efficiency and power. The study of patient and rater characteristics on the levels of consistency and accuracy between raters' classifications will translate to improvements in training radiologists and practice of interpreting mammograms, and ultimately, a more effective breast screening procedure."
"9474307","Project Summary/Abstract Concussion, a traumatically induced brain injury, is described by the Centers for Disease Control as a serious public health problem. Currently, management protocols are based on consensus and expert opinion, rather than high quality evidence, potentially resulting in difficulty in diagnosis and identification of physiologic recovery. The use of objective and quantitative measurements to better understand the etiology of concussion symptoms and the efficacy of intervention protocols may allow investigators to improve post-concussion care. Symptoms such as headache, dizziness, or cognitive difficulties commonly occur after concussion and likely relate to cerebrovascular dysfunction. Cerebral autoregulation, cerebral reactivity, and neurovascular coupling represent three areas of cerebrovascular function that are impaired after a concussion and relate to the presence of specific concussion symptoms. Cerebrovascular functioning may also relate to higher order cognitive functions, such as executive functioning. Combined gait and cognitive tests (dual-tasks) can probe executive function abilities, and can also objectively reveal post-concussion deficits. Thus, improved understanding of how concussion symptomology, cerebrovascular function, and gait function relate to one another will help in the objective monitoring of recovery. Additionally, rehabilitative strategies in concussion care have remained relatively ineffective, particularly when initiated soon after injury. Sub-maximal aerobic exercise is one potential rehabilitative strategy to improve cerebrovascular function, locomotor performance, and executive functioning, in addition to alleviating post-concussion symptoms. Therefore, we seek to examine 52 symptomatic adolescents within two weeks of a concussion on measures of symptom severity, cerebrovascular function, gait, and executive functioning. Participants will be pseudo-randomized into an 8- week sub-maximal aerobic exercise intervention or usual care, and physical activity intensity and duration will be objectively monitored with a heart rate monitor. Accordingly, we will 1) determine the relationship between symptoms, cerebrovascular function, gait, and executive function soon after a concussion, and 2) investigate the effect of an aerobic exercise intervention protocol on concussion recovery. We believe this represents an important line of research as few studies have used quantitative and objective measures to examine the efficacy of concussion treatments, and our study design will allow us to observe how post-concussion aerobic exercise initiated soon after injury affects recovery trajectories. Thus, improved understanding of the role of physical activity after concussion may eventually pave the way to develop better therapeutic interventions, and eliminate ?one therapy for all? treatments."
"9413328","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract We are in the midst of an unprecedented epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The proportion of the population with T2DM has doubled in just one generation. Although the epidemic is primarily driven by obesity, only ~20% of obese individuals develop T2DM. Genetic factors play a major role in determining who among obese individuals will progress to develop T2DM. The heritability of T2DM has been estimated to be approximately 0.5. Genetic studies in humans have identified many loci that contribute to diabetes susceptibility. Nearly all of these loci are involved in ?-cell biology. However, these loci only account for a small part of the high heritability of T2DM. A guiding premise of this grant proposal is that an important source of the missing heritability of human diabetes genetics is the inabiliy to carry out in-depth mechanistic phenotyping of beta-cell function. Here, we propose to carry out deep phenotyping of pancreatic islets to identify genes and pathways that confer susceptibility to T2DM. The project involves a hybrid strategy, employing two complementary mouse genetic cohorts: 1) a population of outbred mice and 2) a panel of recombinant inbred (RI) strains, both derived from the same founder population. This population, The Collaborative Cross, was derived from eight founder strains that together capture a major part of the genetic variability available in inbred mouse strains. Our preliminary studies of the founder strains revealed a high degree of phenotypic diversity in traits related to diabetes susceptibility. These results predict that the traits we propose to study will have strong heritability. Our team consist of a laboratory with extensive experience in islet biology and diabetes genetics together with four statistical geneticists who have developed many of the widely used methods for QTL mapping and causal network construction. We will carry out studies of insulin secretion, beta-cell proliferation and oxidative metabolism. In addition, we will conduct transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic studies on isolated pancreatic islets. In addition to classical association mapping, we will use genetic association data to construct causal networks linking gene loci with intermediate traits and disease phenotypes. Based on our prior experience with successful positional cloning projects, we predict that the loci we identify will be highly relevan to diabetes susceptibility in humans."

Rev. Stat. §81-601). This research will use existing available data and wil identify new data sources in order to collect, analyze, and interpret surveillance data, putting a special emphasis on underserved, high risk groups such as minorities, young workers, older workers, and workers in high risk industries and occupations. We will collect all 21 occupational health indicators which have been identified by the NIOSH-States Occupational Health Surveillance Work Group. These indicators are specific measures of health or risk status (i.e. the occurrence of a health event or of factors associated with that event) among specific working populations. To further enhance surveillance for reportable conditions associated with workplace exposures, we will implement a surveillance system incorporating investigation and analysis of occupational poisoning or illness due to exposures to pesticides, lead, and other chemicals prioritized by our stakeholders. We will generate and communicate information with our partners to guide interventions and develop recommendations for prevention through making referrals, disseminating data and findings, and conducting educational outreach. In addition to surveillance activities, our program will maintain existing relationships and build new collaborations with local, state, and national stakeholders to further integrate occupational health into mainstream public health.

"9497167","Project Summary / Abstract Heart disease accounts for 1 in 7 of all deaths in the USA, the majority of which are caused by atherosclerotic plaques. Atherosclerosis and its complications are the leading cause of disability and deaths worldwide. In addition, they also significantly contribute to the health care financial burden. Therefore, there is a clear need for the development of novel therapies aimed at new signaling pathways and gene targets. Treatment strategies targeting broad inflammatory and metabolic gene programs are desirable to achieve complete cessation and reversal of plaque development. There is an increasing appreciation that transcriptionally dynamic macrophages are a key player in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We have established that CITED2 represents a molecular ?switch,? that promotes anti-atherogenic macrophage activation while repressing harmful pro-atherogenic phenotypes. Our preliminary studies revealed that, (a) CITED2 expression is attenuated in human and murine atherosclerotic plaque macrophages; (b) Anti-atherogenic stimuli enhance and pro-atherogenic agents attenuate CITED2 expression in human, and murine macrophages; (c) Deficiency of Cited2 enhance macrophage lipid accumulation and foam cell formation; (d) Reduction in Cited2 expression results in heightened basal levels of lipid influx gene while significantly diminished lipid metabolism and efflux gene expression; (e) Myeloid-specific deficiency of Cited2 significantly elevated high-fat diet induced atherosclerotic lesion formation in vivo. (f) Cited2 executes atheroprotective functions by cooperating with PPAR? while antagonizing IRF1 activation in macrophages. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that CITED2 is a critical negative regulator of macrophage pro-inflammatory activation, foam cell formation and atherogenesis. We propose following aims to determine the precise role macrophage CITED2 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In Aim 1: To dissect the precise molecular mechanism by which CITED2 regulates macrophage inflammatory and lipid homeostasis gene expression. In Aim 2: To investigate the role of CITED2 in macrophage lipid homeostasis and foam cell formation. In Aim 3: To examine the impact of myeloid-CITED2 deficiency on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have expanded our fundamental insights into the molecular role of CITED2 in atherogenesis. Thus, the outcome of our studies may provide novel opportunities to design therapeutic intervention in the treatment of human lipid metabolic disorders."
"9469520","TR&D 2: Bioprinting Patterning for Cell-Laden Constructs  Project Summary  A major challenge for tissue and organ engineering is the production of three-dimensional (3D) biomimetic,  cellular tissue constructs of clinically relevant size, shape, and structural integrity needed for the replacement of  damaged or injured tissues. To address this need, we have been investigating 3D bioprinting technologies, which  are designed to print cell-laden hydrogel bioinks as well as polymeric biomaterials, to manufacture complex,  multi-cellular living tissue constructs that mimic the structure of native tissues. In addition, we have been  optimizing the formulation of biomaterials to serve as the scaffolding for 3D bioprinting, and providing the  biological environment needed for the successful delivery of cells and biomaterials to specific locations within  the 3D structures. It has become evident that the patterning design of the cell-laden biomaterials is critical for  achieving adequate nutrition and functional outcomes. In this project, we will (1) develop bioink formulations and  functionalize to control cell positioning with high printability, (2) fabricate biofunctional bioink formulations to  control the cell microenvironment, and (3) validate bioprinted multiple cell populations with interacting  functionalities for bone tissue regeneration in vivo. The results of this project - which will be shared with the broad  community - will be to establish the ideal parameters needed for cell positioning during 3D printing of tissues,  thus establishing a community wide approach for engineering tissues."
"9466070","PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed Phase I STTR project is a partnership between a biotechnology company KXTbio, Inc. and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to develop an innovative high-throughput screening service for identifying new drug candidates that act via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This large protein superfamily has been the most successful source of therapeutic targets, accounting for 40% of all prescription pharmaceuticals in such diverse areas as cancer, cardiac dysfunction, diabetes, central nervous system disorders, obesity, inflammation, and pain. However, with much of the low hanging fruit already picked, the pace of GPCR drug discovery and development has slowed due to the challenges associated with obtaining 3D structures of GPCRs and performing structure-activity studies. Concurrently, new findings in GPCR pharmacology research have uncovered previously unknown intricacies of GPCR signaling that expanded their potential as targets for therapeutic interventions even further. Considering the decreasing productivity in the pharmaceutical industry and rising development costs, more effective methods of identifying GPCR drug candidates would be highly valuable. Although crystal structures of GPCRs are now being generated, their utility will remain limited for the foreseeable future. Various functional assays are currently the mainstay of GPCR screening efforts, and rely on detecting downstream cellular signaling events initiated by changes in GPCR activity. Chosen for their strong and easy to measure signals, these techniques are performed in live cell cultures, making them prone to off-target effects resulting in both false positives and false negatives, introducing higher variability and costs, as well as reduced throughput. KXTbio and UNC Chapel Hill aim to develop a new screening technology that would eliminate many of the drawbacks of the existing methods. The new high-throughput screening (HTS) platform will use purified GPCRs and G proteins, thus avoiding cell cultures. GPCR activity will be monitored by the immediately ensuing G protein activation involving an exchange of the bound GDP molecule for a GTP. The fluorescent analog of GTP whose fluorescent yield increases upon G protein binding will be used in the assay as the signal source. This proposed real-time HTS system can differentiate between agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators, using a minimal number of components, thus reducing artefacts and cell-dependent effects. In contrast to related G protein activation assays it does not require filtration and washing steps or radiolabels. In this Phase I project KXTbio aims to deliver a proof of concept of the proposed HTS GPCR platform, and if successful, a Phase II project will follow, where the platform will be fully implemented, tested, and optimized in a multi-well plate format. KXTbio plans to commercialize it is as a service with a possibility of licensing the technology to drug discovery companies."
"9440836","Mother-infant interaction sets the behavioral foundation and trajectory for infant social/cognitive development. Parental social behaviors are especially vulnerable to endocrine-disrupting chemicals because these behaviors are shaped by hormonal priming and by the organization of the social/parental brain. It is known that in utero bisphenol A (BPA) exposure disturbs neurobehavioral development in animals and in humans. The pathways linking in utero BPA exposure to neurobehavioral development likely involve direct effects in utero, and indirect effects via disruption of postnatal mother-infant interactions. To date, little human study has linked prenatal BPA exposure to altered mother-infant interaction or examined the consequence of this effect on neurobehavioral development. Most of the human literature identifies effects of BPA in older children. In rodent and primate models, prenatal exposure to BPA disrupts maternal care and offspring social behavior via epigenetic changes. In humans, these indirect effects on mother-infant interaction and the associated epigenetic mechanisms have not been examined. We thus risk underestimating the full impact of BPA exposure, and we currently do not know the pathways through which BPA may disrupt development. Although BPA has been removed from many consumer products, it has been replaced by structural analogs, bisphenol-s (BPS) and bisphenol-f (BPF), which may have similar detrimental effects. This study aims to translate findings from animal models to ask whether increased prenatal BPA, BPS, BPF (BP) exposure in humans predicts less optimal maternal care/mother-infant interaction and infant/toddler development. Moreover we ask whether this exposure is associated with corresponding epigenetic changes in mother and infant in genes previously shown to be impacted by prenatal BPA exposure in rodents: estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1: implicated in maternal behavior) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; implicated in infant neural plasticity and cognition). In our translational approach, we recruit women during pregnancy, assess prenatal BP exposure using multiple urine samples collected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. We assess mother-infant interaction with measures of moment-by-moment reciprocal influences between mother and infant, providing a more nuanced measure of the effects of BP in humans, and we assess infant/toddler social and cognitive development at 12 and 24 months. In serially collected buccal swabs, we assess DNA methylation of ESR1 in the mother and infant and of BDNF in the infant to understand how early life BP exposure alters these pathways. Understanding the effects of BP on maternal care and mother-infant interaction is essential to revealing the pathways through which BP acts to disrupt neurodevelopment. This R01 addresses a critical gap in our understanding of how prenatal endocrine-disrupting chemicals alter mother-infant interaction, infant/toddler development, and associated epigenetic processes, with implications for strategies to prevent and mitigate the impact of BP on neurodevelopment."
"9466673","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, rapidly progressive and fatal disease that is characterized by pulmonary arterial remodeling, severe pulmonary hypertension, and progressive right heart failure. The prognosis of PAH is poor with an approximate 15% mortality within 1 year on modern therapy. Over the past two decades, a number of medications for the treatment of PAH have been shown to improve patient symptoms and exercise capacity; however, none of the current treatments are curative and long-term prognosis remains poor. There remains a high unmet need for novel PAH targets and therapies that reverse the disease process and improve long-term health outcomes. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a 28 amino acid peptide hormone that activates VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors in the pulmonary vasculature and has been shown to relax pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, neutralize pulmonary vasoconstrictors, and inhibit pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Additionally, VIP improves right heart systolic and diastolic function and has broad anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic actions. VIP has been shown to be effective in reversing pulmonary vascular remodeling and prolonging survival in a murine model of PAH. PB1046is a recombinant acid fusion protein comprising biologically active VIP at the N-terminus and a physiologically inert repeating polymeric elastin-like peptide (ELP) at the C-terminus. The fusion of VIP to the ELP moiety significantly increases in vivo exposure through sustained release from the injection site, extended circulatory half-life and protection from enzymatic degradation. PB1046 is active as a fusion protein, i.e. the VIP moiety activates the receptor without a requirement to be cleaved or released from the ELP biopolymer. PhaseBio has tested PB1046 in a single-dose Phase 1 study in which the PK and PD enhancement of VIP via the ELP fusion was clearly demonstrated in the observed week-long PB1046 exposure profile and systolic blood pressure lowering effect after a single-dose in essential hypertension patients. Importantly, PB1046 demonstrated a clean single-dose safety/tolerability profile across the expected therapeutic dose range. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we are applying for funding for the Phase 1b and Phase 2 studies of PB1046 in patients with PAH. PhaseBio will investigate the multi-dose safety, PK, and PD of PB1046 in an open-label, non- placebo controlled, multi-dose Phase 1b study of PB1046 in PAH patients who have an implanted pulmonary arterial pressure monitor (cardioMEMS). In this initial study, PB1046 will be administered as once weekly subcutaneously injections x 4 weeks at a dose level previously tested and shown to be safe and well tolerated in subjects from the single-dose Phase 1 study and in an ongoing Phase 1 multiple ascending dose study in ambulatory heart failure patients. When the safety, PK, and PD profile of PB1046 are confirmed in PAH subjects, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 study of PB1046 will be initiated to investigate the potential beneficial effects of PB1046 on exercise capacity and hemodynamics in symptomatic PAH patients."
"9189567","Background: VA performance monitoring makes extensive use of diagnosis-based quality measures that track delivery of care only among patients who have qualifying ICD-9 diagnosis codes. Diagnosis-based measures can be calculated using existing VA data, allowing for low-cost, near real-time performance monitoring. However, diagnosis-based measures can have critical validity problems if the targeted condition is under- or over-diagnosed to differing degrees across facilities. When variation is diagnosing and coding occurs, facility rankings on measured performance can be misleading: High performing facilities can score poorly, low performing facilities can score well, and facilities with the same real performance can fall at opposite ends of the facility rank distribution. Use of diagnosis-based process measures can therefore undermine one of the primary purposes of quality measurement: The comparison of facilities and systems. In addition, diagnosis- based measures cannot be used to detect gaps in access to care for patients who have a targeted condition but no qualifying diagnosis code. Finally, when diagnosis rates vary across patient subgroups, diagnosis-based measures cannot be used to detect and act on healthcare disparities. Problems with diagnosis-based measures could be remedied if true prevalence data were available: Comparisons of performance based on diagnosis- versus prevalence-based measures would detect facilities with anomalous diagnosis rates and distinguish variation in true performance from variation in case-finding. However, for many conditions, the electronic health record (EHR) does not contain data on true prevalence. Objectives: The goal of the proposed project is to develop a general method for improving diagnosis-based measures when valid prevalence data are not readily available. We propose to build a model for predicting prevalence using multiple sources of existing data and to validate it through a one-time collection of gold standard outcome data (survey-based SUD prevalence). Leveraging existing data with targeted collection of model development and validation data is a cost-effective strategy to improve diagnosis-based measures without requiring ongoing, expensive disease surveillance. Focusing on substance use disorder (SUD) care as an example, the objectives of this study are to: (a) assess the degree of SUD under- or over-diagnosis by comparing the proportion of patients with coded SUD diagnoses in the VA administrative data to SUD prevalence estimates obtained using a validated measure in a patient survey conducted at 30 VA healthcare systems; (b) refine and validate a model for predicting SUD prevalence among VA patients using multiple existing data sources; and (c) assess disparities in SUD diagnosis by comparing diagnosis rates to survey- based SUD prevalence estimates across patient age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups. Methods: We will collect data on DSM-IV and DSM-5-concordant SUD among VA patients using a validated instrument. We will conduct telephone interviews with patients at 30 VA healthcare systems selected based on geographic region and expected differences between observed SUD diagnosis and true SUD prevalence. We will compare observed diagnosis rates to survey-based prevalence estimates. We will refine a prototype SUD prediction model using as inputs population SUD surveillance data for Veterans from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, EHR data from VA Corporate Data Warehouse, and organizational survey data from the VA Drug and Alcohol Program Survey. The model will be developed and validated using survey-based SUD prevalence as the outcome. We will fit the model using traditional methods and more modern machine learning algorithms and will select a final model based on established criteria for predictive validity. We will compute facility performance rankings using diagnosis rates versus predicted prevalence to assess the extent to which variation in performance may reflect variation in diagnosis or coding. Finally, we will assess possible disparities in diagnosing by comparing the gap between diagnosis and estimated prevalence across patient groups."
"9509973","Recent advances in sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of a multitude of novel zoonotic viruses, some of which are closely related to known human pathogens. In most cases, only partial viral genome sequences were identified, and no infectious viruses were isolated, hampering research aimed at assessing the pathogenic potential of these novel viruses. A prime example of a sequence-based novel virus is Lloviu virus (LLOV), the newest member of the filovirus family. LLOV is closely related to the highly pathogenic ebola- and marburgviruses that cause severe disease in humans with extraordinarily high case fatality rates. The genomic viral RNA of LLOV was isolated from dead bats in Spain and is rudimentary. Important sequence elements located at the LLOV genome ends are missing. These include the antigenomic promoter that is essential for viral genome replication. Therefore, studies addressing LLOV genome replication and transcription, or pathogenesis have been impossible to date. In this proposal, we bring together expertise in the field of filoviral replication and transcription, rescue of filovirus clones, filovirus pathogenesis, and statistical modeling to generate infectious LLOV clones for in vitro and in vivo studies. By complementing the missing LLOV sequence with homologous sequences from related filoviruses, we have successfully established a hybrid LLOV minigenome system, enabling studies of LLOV replication and transcription for the first time. Based on this system, we will utilize LLOV minigenome systems in combination with statistical modeling to optimize the complemented promoter sequences (Aim 1). These optimized minigenome systems build the foundation for the generation and rescue of infectious full-length LLOV clones. The generated LLOV clones will then be characterized in in vitro studies. We will determine replication kinetics and host response signatures in primary human cells (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform pathogenesis studies with LLOV using a small animal model of filovirus infection (Aim 3). These studies will be instrumental to get a better understanding of the virulence of LLOV and its potential to cause disease in animals and humans. The platform developed in this project to assess the pathogenic potential of novel viruses can be adapted to other nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses and would therefore be of great benefit to the scientific community."
"9647619","Project Summary/Abstract: The basal ganglia are a richly interconnected group of subcortical brain nuclei that are critical for the motivation, selection, initiation and execution of actions. Consistent with these roles, dysfunction of the basal ganglia is linked to a range of debilitating psychomotor disorders including Parkinson?s disease, Huntington?s disease, dystonia, addiction, obsessive compulsive disorder and Tourette?s syndrome. The significance of the basal ganglia for both health and disease, together with the development and refinement of experimental approaches for their interrogation, have motivated the formation of large basic, translational and clinical research communities focused on these structures. Despite the importance of basal ganglia research there was until the inaugural 2014 Basal Ganglia Gordon Research Conference (GRC) only one meeting dedicated to the basal ganglia, ?IBAGS?, a triennial international meeting that is mostly held outside the USA. Furthermore, in contrast to the more interactive, discussion-focused format of a GRC, the IBAGS meeting utilizes a conventional symposium format. In 2016 the Basal Ganglia GRC incorporated a 1.5 day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) organized by and exclusively for pre- and post-doctoral trainees. The success of the 2014 and 2016 meetings recently led the GRC board to approve the Basal Ganglia GRC & GRS as a regular, biennial meeting. The programs for the 2018 Basal Ganglia GRC & GRS were designed by an interdisciplinary committee guided by suggestions from the field. Thus, the 2018 meeting has an almost entirely new roster of speakers and covers topics that have previously received little attention including basal ganglia development, striosomes/patches, involvement of the basal ganglia in neuropsychiatric disorders, interactions of the basal ganglia with the wider motor system and basal ganglia connectomics. The unique format of the GRC and GRS, with a focus on unpublished data, discussion, and diversity in a respectful and nurturing environment, is of immense value to the basic, translational, and clinical scientific research communities and a key catalyst for basal ganglia research worldwide. The 2018 Basal Ganglia GRC and GRS have 3 specific aims: 1) accelerate advances in basal ganglia research by showcasing groundbreaking research in a uniquely interactive and respectful environment that fosters critical thinking, challenges dogma, identifies major unanswered questions, and builds collaboration and collegiality 2) promote diversity in basal ganglia research in terms of scientific approach and subject, gender balance, career stage, and minority representation through targeted programming and attendee selection and support 3) inspire, educate and mentor early career scientists at a critical phase of their careers through exposure to diverse, cutting-edge research, career mentorship, free and open discussion with more established scientists, and opportunities for scientific presentation and communication. Successful completion of these aims will strengthen and diversify research on the basal ganglia, thus accelerating discovery and translation to the clinic, consistent with the core mission of NIH."
"9532535","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With persons aged > 65 years representing the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, the prevention of age-related functional decline and disability is an important public health priority. The loss of functional abilities in advanced age is associated with not only the onset of disability and the loss of independence but also with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. To date, physical exercise is the only intervention consistently demonstrated to improve physical function among older adults and is increasingly being considered the standard of care for treating functional impairments. However, significant variability exists in responsiveness to exercise. As such, many individuals do not achieve clinically-significant improvements in function despite good adherence. Accordingly, there is a need to identify adjuvant therapies capable of improving the efficacy of exercise in treating older adults with functional impairments. This application proposes conduct a pilot study to investigate the potential of resveratrol, a commercially-available nutritional product, to enhance the efficacy of physical exercise in improving physical function among older adults with functional impairments. The overarching objective of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intervention combining resveratrol supplementation and physical exercise among sedentary persons aged > 65 years objectively-measured functional impairments. A total of 60 participants will be recruited to participate in this three month intervention study. All participants will engae in a center-based exercise program 3/days per week and will be randomly assigned to consume 1) placebo, 2) 250 mg/day resveratrol, or 3) 1000 mg/day resveratrol. This study will provide critical information regarding the influence of REX on objectively-measured and self-assessed indices of physical function. The study will also provide novel biologic information regarding the relative effects of REX on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function."
"9459992","SUMMARY The genetic basis of social behavior is complex and involves many genes spread throughout the genome. As a result, it has been difficult to link specific genes to social behavior in humans. Increasing accessibility to genomic resources has now made it feasible to draw such connections in novel animal models. Well-chosen models make possible an experimental, mechanistic strategy that begins at the level of gene variation and works up through layers of biological organization, connecting each level to the one below, to explain the effect of genetic variation on behavioral phenotype. The proposed research will leverage a large body of previous work, conducted by the PI and collaborators, in a natural animal model uniquely suited for connecting genes and social behavior. In the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), a common North American songbird, an inversion on chromosome 2 (ZAL2m) has significantly altered social strategies. Limited gene flow between the ZAL2 and ZAL2m haplotypes has driven genetic differentiation of the rearranged region. As a direct result, ZAL2m individuals of both sexes employ a life history strategy different from that of their ZAL2 counterparts ? they are more aggressive and less parental. The long-term goal is to use this inversion as a target to show how a small genetic change can have large downstream effects on complex behavioral phenotypes. The PI and collaborators have already identified a limited number of genes located inside the inversion that meet the following criteria: (1) expression differs between birds with and without the inversion, (2) the genes show high allele-specific expression in heterozygotes, and (3) expression is tightly correlated with vocal aggression. These genes include a neuropeptide previously implicated in aggression, a serotonin receptor, and a glutamate receptor. The objective of the proposed renewal application is to systematically evaluate the causal effects of variation in these genes on aggressive phenotypes, working up through multiple levels of biological organization from genotype to phenotype. First, the team will precisely identify the genetic variation responsible for differential expression of these genes. Second, they will use bottom-up and targeted proteomics to show the impact of genetic differentiation on the expression of protein isoforms in the brain. Finally, they will manipulate production of the relevant proteins to test their roles in aggressive behavioral phenotypes. A major strength of the research strategy is that the team will combine discovery-based, genome-wide approaches with hypothesis-driven, targeted approaches, using the former to inform the latter. The project is innovative because it takes advantage of a unique, powerful model organism that can be studied in its natural habitat. The significance of this work is that it will move beyond genotype-phenotype associations to test for causal connections between gene variants and social behavior, at multiple levels of biological organization, in a vertebrate. Using this strategy, the investigators will advance understanding of not only which genes contribute to behavioral phenotypes, but how they do so."
"9496650","Although the link between the immune system and the gut microbiome is being increasingly appreciated, the mechanistic links between the microbiome and inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are unclear. Thus, there is a critical need to define mechanisms by which gut bacteria maintain immune homeostasis and thereby affect neuroinflammation. We have recently reported that MS patients have altered gut microbiota compared to healthy controls, with a reduced abundance of certain human gut bacteria (Parabacteroides, Adlercreutzia, and Prevotella) with the ability to metabolize phytoestrogen. Gut bacteria metabolize phytoestrogen into equol which has structural similarity with estrogen, and can regulate immune responses through estrogen receptors and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Our preliminary data showing significantly milder EAE in mice on a phytoestrogen (Isoflavones) containing diet compared to those on a phytoestrogen free diet suggest a critical role of phytoestrogen in modulation of EAE. Additionally, Prevotella histicola, a member of the Prevotella genus, can suppress disease in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a preclinical murine model of MS. However, the importance of phyoestrogen metabolism in P. histicola?mediated disease suppression is unknown. The central hypothesis of the proposed studies is that the human gut commensal P. histicola mediate its disease-protective effect through metabolism of phytoestrogen and subsequent activation of immunoregulatory cells. We will test our central hypothesis using animal model, genetically modified mice, and a cell culture approach in the following two specific aims. In first aim, we will utilize P. histicola as a representative phytoestrogen-metabolizing gut commensal bacteria to determine whether metabolism of phytoestrogen is required for ability of P. histicola to suppress disease and induce Tregs and/or CD103+ Tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs). We will determine the importance of AMPK signaling in the phytoestrogen induced activation of Tregs and/or tolerogenic DCs. In second aim, we will determine whether the phytoestrogen plus bacteria mediate the induction of immunoregulatory cells via estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent pathways in intestinal epithelial cells and/or immune cells. Our study is fit for the ?High Priority Immunology Grant (R01) mechanism because we are proposing to determine the mechanisms underlying the microbial impact on systemic immunity which can be harnessed in designing potential mono as well as combination therapies because drugs with diverse non-overlapping mechanisms might provide maximal benefit to MS patients. We will determine whether phytoestrogen-metabolizing bacteria maintain a disease-free state by tilting the Tregs to Th1/Th17 balance towards Tregs through its interaction with estrogen receptors and the AMPK pathway. We expect the outcome of our study will have a positive impact on development of gut microbial-flora/diet-based therapies for MS as well as other inflammatory autoimmune diseases."
"9171993","PROJECT SUMMARY  Bacterial pathogens use diverse strategies to evade host defenses and colonize mammalian tissues. Some bacteria evade aspects of the host immune system, such as neutrophils and antibodies, by hiding inside of macrophages. Macrophages, however, are good bacterial killers in their own right. Therefore, how bacteria withstand macrophage defenses and acquire sufficient nutrients to survive and even replicate remains a key question in infection biology. We intend to close this knowledge gap by developing new tools to probe macrophage-bacterial interactions. Some of these tools could become the basis of antibacterial treatments. We study the Gram-negative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica, which colonizes macrophages in a murine typhoid fever model. We recently developed a quantitative, phenotypic, high content, in- macrophage screen for small molecules that prevent or increase bacterial growth inside of macrophages. Based on our pilot screen, we anticipate identifying a total of approximately 118 small molecules that prevent and 5 that promote S. enterica replication within macrophages. We propose to analyze compound chemical structure, evaluate purity, and establish the Effective Concentration50 and characterize the effect of compounds on infection dynamics and cell morphology using in vivo imaging."
"9415336","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek continuation of our IMSD program that focuses on preparing talented undergraduate scholars from underrepresented groups (URs) for later success in graduate school. The successful growth of our program is best illustrated by the fact that over the previous 3 funding cycles, there has been a progressive increase in the percentage of IMSD scholars entering PhD programs, now approaching 60% of all participants in IMSD III. Although the majority of IMSD scholars are recruited from a rich pool of KU UR students, the impact of this program is broadened by our partnership with a neighboring tribal college that allows a unique opportunity to recruit American Indians. IMSD IV proposes four levels of impact. Level I: The core of our program, preparing highly trained IMSD scholars from underrepresented groups for successful completion of PhD programs; Level II: enhancing underrepresented-student success and retention in the sciences at KU through supplemental instruction; Level III: building overall diversity at KU; and Level IV: disseminating successful approaches beyond the borders of KU. The training of IMSD scholars follows a thoughtfully organized stepwise plan that centers on the undergraduate research experience. The mentoring of our scholars will be provided by the faculty research mentor, program directors, the IMSD program coordinator, teaching postdoctoral fellows and IMSD peers (senior scholars). Innovative approaches in training include the formulation and use of an online Individual Development Plan (IDP) that extends beyond the traditional academic degree plan and requires scholars to carefully consider the requirements and training needed for later success in graduate school. We are developing a new performance-based rubric to assess the scholars' research skill development. We also incorporate in our mentoring a web video based mentoring system (Science Career Pathway) developed by KU IMSD that provides mentoring from peers and successful scientists in a format relevant to college students. All scholars complete seminars in topics ranging from responsible conduct of research to preparing highly competitive applications to graduate school and appropriate T-32 programs. Full institutionalization of the supplemental instruction, developed in IMSD II and III to promote student success in the sciences, will occur in IMSD IV. IMSD staff will develop new materials to increase the number of students who have benefitted from these enhancements to math and science curriculum. Publication of results from the successes of our program and uses of our Science Career Path mentoring system constitute the dissemination plan. Evaluation of measurable objectives for all four levels of the program will be carried out by an external evaluator with the assistance from the internal evaluation team. Evaluation and tracking procedures allow for periodic adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. Continuation of the KU IMSD will maintain the momentum and proven success in recruiting and preparing a diverse group of undergraduate IMSD scholars for subsequent completion of the PhD and entry into the scientific community."
"9414088","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that causes demyelination and axonal damage. Current therapies available to MS patients are sub-optimal, and there is no cure for this chronic, debilitating disease. B cell depletion therapies have shown promise in several treatment trials, yet B cells can also play protective and anti-inflammatory roles that are important during health and disease. Determining the mechanisms by which B cell antigen presentation mediates neuroinflammation and tolerance in MS is crucial for developing immunomodulatory therapies targeted to encephalitogenic B cell functions. Using an in vivo conditional MHCII expression system and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), our lab has demonstrated that B cells are not sufficient antigen presenting cells (APCs) for passive EAE induced by adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic CD4 T cells unless enough B cells recognize the cognate antigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Further experiments have supported our hypothesis that MOG-specific, membrane bound B cell receptor, rather than MOG-specific secreted immunoglobulin, is critical to the propagation of CD4 T cell auto-reactivity, likely for efficient capture of target antigen. These findings highlight the importance of soluble antibody independent B cell functions to MS pathogenesis. In Aim 1 I will determine restrictions on the location of B cell antigen presentation by quantifying B cell localization and MHCII expression in the CNS compartment. I will also assay murine cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of intrathecal immunoglobulin indicative of B:T cell cognate interactions within the CNS. Lastly, the capacities of non-specific and antigen-specific B cells from passive EAE mice to traverse an in vitro blood brain barrier model will be tested. In Aim 2 I will define the effect of antigen-specifc B cells on CD4 T cell lineage fate during EAE. T cell cytokine production will be determined in antigen recall assays using naïve and in vitro- primed splenocytes from WT mice and mice with conditional expression in various APC subsets. Additionally, I will define the cytokine expression profile of B cells from different B-cell dependent EAE models and quantify B cell expression of IL-1?. The hypothesis that B cells shape T cell lineage plasticity will be tested by modulating th timing of B cell antigen presentation in passive EAE in conjunction with dendritic cell MHCII expression. Successful completion of the research proposed in these aims will increase our understanding of cellular mechanisms of inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the CNS. We will identify where important pathogenic functions of B cells occur in EAE and distinguish mechanisms of pathogenic cytokine generation as potential targets for immunotherapy in MS."
"9573815","ABSTRACT  The goal of this project is to study the role of the host SK1-S1P pathway in controlling the infection by Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn). In previous studies, we identified that the host sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) and its product sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are critical for the formation of the lung granuloma against Cn.1-3 Our studies in mice are supported by the observation that patients treated with FTY720 (Fingolimod) for multiple sclerosis4 (MS) developed cryptococcosis.5-9 When we administered FTY720 to our model of mouse granuloma, Cn lung infection reactivated and fungal cells disseminated from the lung to the brain tissue, eventually killing the animals. Intriguingly, this effect was not observed with BAF312 or AUY954 treatment. FTY720 is a sphingosine analog that, once phosphorylated, mimics S1P and binds to S1P receptors S1Pr1, S1Pr3 and S1Pr510 whereas the un-phosphorylated form of BAF312 or AUY954 binds to S1Pr1 and S1Pr5,11 or only to S1Pr1,12 respectively. These results suggest that SK1-S1P may regulate the containment of Cn cells within the lung granuloma through the inhibition of a specific S1P receptor(s), such as S1Pr3, as this is one of the receptors targeted by FTY720 but not by the other compounds. Because these drugs all induce a severe lymphopenia by blocking the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes,13-15 our studies also suggest that lymphopenia may not be sufficient for Cn infection to reactivate.  Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the action of S1P on S1Pr regulates the host cellular immunity against Cn and that blocking S1Pr3 is detrimental for the host and may lead to reactivation of cryptococcosis during lymphopenia. Thus we will: 1) determine how SK1-S1P regulates the formation of Cn granuloma; and 2) define the host immune response controlled by SK1-S1P that protects against the reactivation of Cn granuloma."
"9411112","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is reaching epidemic proportions in Western societies. T2D occurs when the ß-cells of the pancreas do not secrete enough insulin to properly regulate peripheral blood glucose levels, usually in the face of obesity and associated peripheral insulin resistance. The mechanisms underlying insulin secretion are not properly understood. Using a forward genetics approach, we have discovered that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the protein-coding region of the gene for tomosyn-2 is directly correlated with the hypoinsulinemic/hyperglycemic phenotype. Tomosyn-2 is a relatively uncharacterized protein and the mechanism by which it regulates insulin secretion is not known. The work proposed here in this Pathways to Independence Award application has two primary goals: 1) to elucidate the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 regulates insulin secretion in pancreatic ß-cells, and 2) to use my development of this novel area of T2D research to facilitate the development of my career from the mentored phase to an independent phase. During the mentored phase of the grant, I will receive training in mass spectrometry, in vitro liposome fusion assays, membrane biochemistry, and the generation of the tomosyn-2 knockout mouse. The research conducted in the mentored phase will examine the effect of identified phosphorylation sites on the ability of tomosyn-2 to regulate insulin secretion and to understand the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 is targeted for proteosomal degradation. During the independent phase of the grant, my research will examine the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 inhibits insulin secretion by regulating the activity of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins and characterize the role of novel tomosyn-2 binding proteins. These studies will provide novel clues to the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 inhibits insulin secretion and will further our understanding of the regulation of insulin secretio in T2D."
"9536404","IRON-DEPENDENCE OF CLOFAZIMINE ACTIVITY IN MYCOBACTERIA ABSTRACT Clofazimine (CFZ) is a riminophenazine dye that can be highly bactericidal against mycobacteria. Originally developed for use against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), it has been primarily used for the treatment of leprosy and is listed by the WHO as an Essential Medicine for adults and children. CFZ has recently been included in the WHO recommended five drug short-course for MDR-TB. However, the efficacy of CFZ for the treatment of Mtb infections in animal models and clinical trials has been mixed. Historically, CFZ demonstrated high activity against Mtb in vitro and in murine models; however, CFZ efficacy was low in other animal models. A recent report indicates that differences in CFZ activity are based on the microenvironment. In a standard BALB/c mouse model CFZ was highly active, whereas in the ?Kramnik? mouse model, CFZ failed to demonstrate activity against Mtb if administered after a point at which necrotic lesions had already formed. The primary difference between models in which CFZ is active and those in which it is not appears to be that necrotic granulomas exist in models in which CFZ is less active. CFZ is a redox-active molecule that interacts with the NADH reductase II of the electron transport system. Mutations that increase expression of MmpL5 confer moderate resistance to CFZ. MmpL5 belongs to the RND efflux family and is important in the export of the mycobacterial siderophores; membrane-bound mycobactin and the soluble form carboxymycobactin. Our data indicate that CFZ bactericidal activity is dependent on iron availability and the presence of the mycobactin iron acquisition system. We have also demonstrated that CFZ exposure induces iron acquisition genes and most importantly CFZ drains Mtb intracellular iron levels indicating CFZ acts via the depletion of intracellular iron. The goals of this project are to determine if CFZ kills through intracellular iron depletion and determine if CFZ efficacy can be improved in disease microenvironments, where iron is readily available, by inhibiting Mtb iron acquisition mechanisms. To achieve these goals we will determine the role of iron availability, acquisition mechanisms, and storage on CFZ killing and intracellular iron levels. We will also determine if chemical inhibition of Mtb iron acquisition will synergize with CFZ to allow lethal activity in necrotic lesions of the Kramnik mouse model."

"9445635","PROJECT SUMMARY:  Lymphoma is the sixth most common form of cancer in the United States, affecting an estimated 23 per 100,000 people. While there have been significant advances in our understanding of lymphoma biology and our ability to provide curative therapy, many patients with lymphoma continue to suffer poor outcomes with approximately 20,000 people dying from lymphoma in the US each year. Novel approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of lymphoma are urgently needed.  This application is focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate MALT1, a central oncoprotein in B-cell lymphoma. MALT1 is a cytoplasmic protein that serves to mediate antigen receptor- dependent lymphocyte activation, proliferation and survival, via stimulation of the canonical pro-survival NF-?B transcription factor. In B-lymphocytes, the antigen receptor is known as the B-cell receptor (BCR). In these cells, BCR-induced, MALT1-dependent NF-?B activation is a required event during the normal adaptive immune response, but dysregulated activation of this pathway can lead to lymphoma. Indeed, genetic analysis has revealed that in specific subtypes of B-cell lymphoma, malignant B cells highjack BCR signaling pathways in order to promote their own growth and survival.  BCR stimulation results in assembly of the CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) protein signaling complex, where MALT1 serves as the effector by carrying out two important functions. First, MALT1 acts as a scaffold to recruit and activate downstream signaling proteins, and second, MALT1 acts as a protease to cleave specific substrate signaling proteins and alter their activities. The critical importance of achieving appropriate regulation of MALT1 activity is demonstrated by the fact that gain-of-function mutations in BCR subunits or in CARMA1, resulting in exaggerated MALT1 activity, are recurrently detected in human B-cell lymphoma. Thus, MALT1 is the subject of intense investigation as a key regulator of B-lymphomagenesis and a promising new target for pharmaceutical inhibition.  This proposal investigates the innovative hypothesis that specific proteins are capable of controlling MALT1 function, such that their loss in some subtypes of B-cell lymphoma may contribute to aberrant MALT1 activity. The presence of gain-of-function BCR or CARMA1 mutants may synergize with loss of such proteins in promoting lymphomagenesis; conversely, loss alone may be pathogenic. Our goals for this proposal are to elucidate the molecular underpinnings by which specific protein-protein interactions can abrogate MALT1 activity, to determine how this interaction influences lymphocyte growth and survival, and to utilize this information to inform the design of novel therapeutic approaches to MALT1-dependent lymphoma."
"9134493","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Heart attack and stroke, which together are called cardiovascular disease, cause over 1/3 of all deaths in VA patients. The current guidelines for the prevention of these conditions focus on lowering patients' blood pressure and cholesterol levels. A new treatment strategy, which I call benefit-based tailored treatment, that instead guides treatment decisions based on the likelihood that a medication would prevent a heart attack or stroke could prevent more cardiovascular disease, with lower medication use, and be more patient centered. The purpose of this Career Development Award is to develop and assess tools and approaches that could enable the implementation of benefit-based tailored treatment of cardiovascular disease, in particular a decision support tool and educational program for clinicians and a performance profiling system. The decision support tool will enable better care by showing clinicians patient-specific estimates of the likelihood that their medication decisions will prevent a cardiovascular disease event. The performance profiling system will encourage better care by assessing the quality of care provided at VA sites and in PACT teams based on how well the medical care provided follows this treatment strategy. The project will have three aims. Aim 1: In the first aim, I will seek to understand clinicians' and patients' perceptions of and receptivity to the use of benefit-based tailored treatment for cardiovascular disease. Information gained from qualitative research with clinicians will help assess and improve the usability and effectiveness of the decision support tool and educational program for clinicians, along with the acceptability of the treatment strategies in general. Information gained from focus groups with patients will help learn their priorities in cardiovascular disease prevention, to help identify ways to make the interventions and their assessments more patient-centered. Aim 2: In the second aim, the decision support tool and educational program will be assessed in a real-world randomized pilot study involving thirty clinicians. Half of the clinicians will be provided the decision support tool and education intervention for ten patients each, the other half will receive a traditional quality improvement program and treatment reminders. The study will have formative goals of ensuring that clinicians and patients believe the tool is valuable and does not disrupt care processes or workflow for anyone in the PACT team. This will be studied with qualitative and survey assessments. The primary summative outcome will be the influence of the intervention on clinicians' treatment decisions. Secondary outcomes will assess patients' satisfaction with their visits and their clinicians. Aim 3: The third aim will develop and evaluate a novel performance measurement system based on benefit- based tailored treatment. First, the performance profiling system will be developed. Then the profiling system's ability to reliably differentiate high quality from low-quality care will be evaluated."
"9416155","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) experience metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, pressure ulcers, and cardiovascular disease at far greater rates than the general population. A rehabilitation method to prevent or reverse the systemic metabolic consequences of SCI is a pressing need. The purpose of this study is to determine the dose of muscle activity that can enhance an oxidative muscle phenotype, and improve clinical markers of metabolic and bone turnover health in patients with acute SCI. The long-term goal of this research is to develop exercise-based interventions to prevent secondary health conditions such as diabetes and to ultimately protect health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Specific Aim 1: To compare changes in skeletal muscle gene regulation in individuals with acute SCI who receive high muscle force standing (HS), low muscle force standing (LS), passive standing (PS), or usual care - (no stimulation and no standing, NS) for 16 weeks. We hypothesize that mRNA expression for metabolic transcription factors and for genes regulating glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial remodeling will support that HS and LS instigate a greater shift toward an oxidative muscle phenotype than PS or NS. A novel finding will be that LS is a powerful regulator of oxidative pathways in skeletal muscle. Specific Aim 2: To compare changes in systemic markers of metabolic health and bone turnover in individuals with SCI who receive HS, LS, PS, or NS for 16 weeks. We hypothesize that HS and LS will demonstrate lower glucose/insulin levels and greater glucagon suppression during oral glucose challenge compared to PS and NS. HS and LS will also demonstrate lower HOMA scores, hemoglobin A1c, fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). LS will be an effective regulator of systemic markers of metabolism. We also hypothesize that HS will demonstrate higher serum levels of osteocalcin, lower levels of type 1 collagen C-telopeptide (CTX), and lower levels of sclerostin than all other groups (HS>LS>PS>NS), indicating an anti-catabolic effect on bone. As a secondary aim, we will measure secondary health conditions (SHCs), HRQOL, and cost effectiveness. We expect that the HS, LS, and PS groups will all show a trend for improved SHCs and HRQOL compared to usual care. We also expect to see an association between metabolic improvement and improved perception of HRQOL. These observations will support that this intervention has strong feasibility for future clinical translaion."
"9519460","PROJECT SUMMARY The 2014 President?s Cancer Panel called underuse of HPV vaccines ?a serious, but correctable threat to progress against cancer.? The Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel, more recently, identified expanding the use of HPV vaccines as a top priority for cancer prevention, especially in medically underserved populations. The overarching goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel, theory-based message framing intervention to accelerate HPV vaccine uptake among African American adolescents. Based on prospect theory and the health belief model, this project aims to 1) develop culturally appropriate messages framed in gains and losses and pretest these messages through community engagement; 2) determine whether/how the effects of message framing (gain vs. loss) on African American parents? acceptance of the HPV vaccine are moderated by their prior beliefs about HPV and the HPV vaccine; and 3) evaluate the efficacy of a message framing intervention rooted in message targeting principles utilizing mobile tablets for efficient targeting through a clinic-based randomized trial. The proposed project will generate key insights into the persuasive effects of message framing as applied to the promotion of HPV vaccination. It will produce solid empirical evidence surrounding a novel, theory-based message framing intervention aimed at accelerating HPV vaccine uptake among African American adolescents. Addressing a critical aspect of health disparities disadvantaging the African American community, this research represents a systematic and timely effort to respond to the call of the 2014 President?s Cancer Panel on the urgency of optimizing communication strategies for promoting HPV vaccination among key stakeholders."

"9466736","Project Summary  Atantares Corp. is seeking funding to develop a standardized foundation of thrombosis evaluation, driven through the principle of unification of standard laboratory and specialized hemostasis testing, inclusive of a diversity of tests such as thromboelastography (TEG), PT/APTT, multiple electrode aggregometer etc., with the potential for iterative advance and multiplexing. Clinical realization of such a platform is far from the mere addition of various tests into a single unit, but transformative, particularly in the pediatric cases where innate diversity in hemorrhagic and thrombotic status is juxtaposed diversity in disease and treatment. Flexible platforms are required. Equally important, sensor miniaturization through our MEMS/microfluidic approach significantly reduces required blood volume (test and dead-space) to perform these various assays, making it ideal for pediatric patients. With deep expertise in MEMS technology, Atantares Corp has designed and is reducing to practice miniaturized and accurate modules of a diversity of hemostasis assays that can be used in isolation, in serial, or in parallelizable fashion at a fraction of the cost and footprint of current stand-alone systems. This technology also synergizes closely with the academic mission of Dr. Kolandaivelu who has examined in detail, the patient specific underpinnings of patient-specific thrombotic events following endovascular manipulations and in an effort to better understand the blood-borne contributors to risk, developed multi-parameter methods of mapping an individual?s hemostatic state in high definition.  Availability of a modular tool can interface directly into existing workflows and provider preferences, at the same time, being leveraged to cost-effectively and systematically build out the needed evidence-base for new applications despite diverse pediatric scenarios (innate variability, ECMO, CHD, arrhythmias, hemophilias, coagulopathies, NICU settings, etc.).  In the scope of this SBIR program, Atantares Corp. will demonstrate the key advantages of MEMS/microfluid technology in functional global hemostasis assays through two specific aims that seek to 1) Create high accuracy MEMS sensors for functional hemostasis assessment (exemplified herein as a uTEG unit; note, TEG is exemplary of a complex module with growing clinical value); as well as 2) Global assay optimization to maximize signal:noise at minimal test volume."
"9455136","Abstract ? Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community."
"9404016","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glycoprotein 130 (gp130) is a hub for a receptor-signaling complex for eight cytokines (IL6, IL-11, IL-27, LIF, CNTF, OSM, CT-1 and CLC). Although gp130 is positioned at the junction of this oncogenic signaling network and is essential for activation of the network, its role as a biomarker in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) progression remains unclear. Furthermore, there are no small-molecule inhibitors of gp130 under clinical development. Validation of gp130 as a biomarker and molecular target in EOC will facilitate the development of gp130-targeting agents and improve EOC therapy. Recently, we have identified first-in-class, efficacious, safe, and orally active inhibitors of gp130. Our preliminary study shows that gp130 is essential for the constitutive activation of Stat3 in EOC cells and supports cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Our lead gp130 inhibitor, SC144, selectively inhibits the activation of downstream signaling pathways induced by gp130 ligands (IL6, LIF), with no significant effects on the activation by non-gp130 ligands, such as IFN-?, SDF-1?, and PDGF. SC144 exhibits cytotoxicity in a panel of drug-sensitive and -resistant EOC cells, with no significant toxicity in human normal epithelial cells. In a mouse xenograft model bearing human EOC tumors, SC144 significantly inhibited tumor growth through gp130 inhibition and induction of necrosis in the tumor. No toxicity was evident in normal tissues. To our knowledge, SC144 is the first-in-class potent and orally active small-molecule gp130 inhibitor. Despite the important role of IL6 in EOC, it is unclear if gp130 can be considered a predictive marker. More significantly, selective inhibition of its signaling pathway in EOC subtypes, cancer stem-like cells, and drug resistance has not been studied. The overarching hypothesis of our study is that gp130 is an important biomarker and that patients with high expression of gp130 or constitutively active gp130 signaling will have poor prognosis and overall survival. We further hypothesize that inhibitors of gp130/Stat3 signaling pathway will effectively block EOC. To determine the significance of prognostic and predictive importance of gp130 as a biomarker in EOC, and assess the effect of its inhibition on patient sample derived tumor growth, we propose the following aims. Aim 1: To validate gp130 as a therapeutic target and a novel biomarker in a large panel of EOC cell lines and patient tissues. Aim 2: To determine in vivo efficacy of SC144, as a single agent and in combination with carboplatin in patient-derived xenografts models from na?ve and drug-resistant patients. Aim 3: To elucidate the role of gp130 and its inhibition by SC144 in EOC stem cells and drug resistance and in our novel murine EOC model with human tumor stroma."
"9448846","PROJECT SUMMARY  Improved control over synovial inflammation is anticiapted to slow bone erosion and reduce the risk of fractures and pain. However, even potent anti-inflammatory strategies such as blockade of TNF or IL6R, only show limited bone repair, suggesting that suppressing inflammation is insufficient to restore osteo-immune balance. Some current and emerging therapies succeed in slowing erosion by suppressing osteoclast activity, but fail to significantly stimulate bone formation. Further, these biologics are not targeted for accumulation at inflammed joints, thus are administered systemically, enhancing the likelihood of serious infection. For therapeutics to succeed in promoting bone repair, they likely must balance levels and activity of several proinflammatory cells to disrupt their interaction with osteoclasts, and promote osteoblast maturation or activity. Thus a critical unmet need for inflammatory bone loss is an intervention that can restore eroded bone through rebalancing immune:bone cell homeostasis in order to reduce fracture risk and improve quality of life for patients. Recent data points to a novel use for cytokine Interleukin-27 (IL-27) as a regulator of immune and bone cell balance, as it reduces osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteoblast proliferation and maturation. Also, IL-27 suppresses activities of immune and synovial cells mediating the onset and maintenance of inflammation and also has anti-angiogenic activity. Current strategies for delivering recombinant (r)IL-27 are systemic and lack specificity to immune or bone cells, and moreover are unable to sustain therapeutic effects over time due to rapid clearance. We propose to examine whether a targeted IL-27, delivered using a sustained expression system, will be effective in promoting bone repair and reducing inflammation in joints using a collagen-antibody induced arthritis (CAIA) model. Intraarticular sonoporation gene delivery (sonodelivery) will transfer into the joints a nanoplex of polymer and plasmid DNA encoding targeted IL-27 to reduce inflammation and promote bone repair. Our hypothesis is that optimizing delivery and targeting of IL-27 to joints will facilitate endogenous bone repair by re-balancing osteo-immune homeostasis.  To test this hypothesis, we propose 1) To achieve therapeutic levels of cytokine in joints, we will optimize IL-27 intra-articular sonodelivery; 2) To enhance cytokine retention in bone and promote endogenous bone repair, we will promote ligand-mediated targeting of IL-27 to bone cells or matrix, and 3) To enhance cytokine retention at the pannus and synovial lining and facilitate bone repair, we will promote ligand-mediated targeting of IL-27 to inflammatory and immune cells. We anticipate that this simple sonodelivery strategy will provide an efficient means to restore eroded bone in articulations affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA). IL-27 is unique in its ability to simultaneously inhibit inflammation and promote bone repair. This approach is exciting in that we envision applications across numerous conditions characterized by bone loss."
"9537246","Influenza viruses are constantly evolving, resulting in vaccine strains being selected for reformulation every season. Annual estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing influenza-related morbidity are essential in evaluating the protection provided by annual, nationwide vaccination programs. Our long-term goal is to advance the understanding of the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections while measuring the public health impact of immunization on reducing the overall burden of illness and on improving the health of the population. We plan to systematically evaluate the influenza VE with the CDC ACIP recommended annual universal immunization strategy in the Baylor Scott & White Health, Central Texas (BSWCTX) patient population. The objective is to obtain reliable vaccination information for the enrolled population and provide accurate estimates of annual VE to prevent influenza-associated medically-attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) in the vaccine age-eligible population. Our central hypothesis is that timely and efficient measurement of annual VE and burden of illness due to seasonal/pandemic influenza, RSV and other respiratory viruses is sustainable. The rationale is that by assessing the mid-season VE, ACIP can recommend antiviral chemoprophylaxis and treatment for high risk groups, as needed. To accomplish the overall objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: 1) Assess influenza VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza among at least 1,000 children and adults, including at least 333 persons from each of three age groups (6 months ? 17 years, 18-49 years and ?50 years) with MAARI in ambulatory settings during each of 5 seasons from 2016-17, with at least 100 among young children aged 6 months ? 8 years and with at least 100 among adults aged ?65 years. 2) Evaluate disease burden due to seasonal influenza (during each of 5 seasons from 2016-17), RSV and other respiratory viruses (during seasons 3-5) among children (ages 6 months ? 17 years), adults (ages 18-64 years) and older adults (ages ?65 years). 3) Develop influenza pandemic preparedness operational plan and pilot research methods (during seasons 3-5) to describe the epidemiology of the novel influenza virus infection, beginning whenever the next influenza pandemic is imminent anywhere in the world, estimate MAARI incidence of pandemic influenza, estimate VE of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for prevention of pandemic influenza-associated MAARI, and evaluate the use and effectiveness of antiviral agents for treatment of pandemic influenza. To accomplish these goals, we will estimate real-time VE for the enrolled population in the ambulatory setting using a test-negative design, estimate burden of illness of seasonal/pandemic influenza, RSV and other respiratory viruses in the BSWCTX source population, and examine factors associated with VE. The proposed research is innovative in that it will generate new knowledge in the methods used to aptly measure influenza VE in different healthcare settings and measure burden of illness of influenza, RSV and other respiratory viruses in the West South Central region of the U.S."
"9428943","Neurodegenerative diseases represent an ever-increasing societal and economic burden with WHO estimates indicating that they will replace cancer as the 2nd leading cause of death by 2040. In neurodegenerative disease research, a wealth of pathways has been uncovered, but their direct and primary relevance to the respective human disease has been difficult to prove and targeting of pathways has remained difficult. The proposed work will identify a treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), a hereditary neurodegenerative disease affecting cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and other neurons in the cerebellum, the subcortical grey matter and spinal cord. The cause of SCA2 is a gain-of-function CAG expansion in the ATXN2 gene resulting in an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) domain in ataxin-2. Our objective is identification of highly-potent antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that lower ATXN2 expression. Our rationale is based on observations in model organisms and humans indicating that higher dosages of the mutant allele/protein worsen disease severity and that down-regulation of mutant polyQ protein expression in rodents reverses clinical manifestations even after mice have become symptomatic. Additionally, complete knock-out of ATXN2 in mice does not cause neurodegeneration or premature death. Merit for this study is supported by positive results in ongoing clinical trials to test ASOs for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), as well as the success of SPINRAZA? (Nusinersen) for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the first ever FDA approved ASO drug for a neurodegenerative disorder. The feasibility of this study is based on our positive proof-of-concept data demonstrating that our lead ATXN2 ASO delays progressive rodent SCA2 motor, molecular, and neurophysiological phenotypes after symptom onset. Five specific aims are proposed: 1) an intensive in vitro screen of ASOs targeting throughout the ATXN2 pre-mRNA including cultured SCA2 patient cells, 2) in vivo screens to identify leads lowering cerebellar ATXN2 in mice, 3) safety toxicity testing in rodents and other species, 4) testing the ASO leads for delaying established SCA2 mouse motor, molecular, and neurophysiological phenotypes, and 5) GMP manufacturing of the single most potent ASO candidate and pre-investigative new drug (IND) meetings with members of the FDA. The proposed work will break new ground for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by demonstrating feasibility of targeting dominant-acting mutated polyQ genes with antisense oligonucleotides."
"9436234","PROJECT SUMMARY In this proposal, we plan to use a Complex Systems Biology approach to characterize the global microbiome and metabolome of various wounds over a longitudinal period of time. In addition, these global profiles will be integrated with an analysis of innate immune potential for activation. The research proposed here has the potential to uncover how the microbiome and innate immune responses influence the wound metabolic landscape and to generate insights into novel, low-cost therapeutic interventions that exploit microbial metabolic pathways or host cell metabolic immunomodulation changes. The ultimate goal is to develop evidence-based, medical countermeasure protocols that could be initiated in the clinic and followed by an outpatient population. By 2050, the American Diabetes Foundation predicts that one in three adults in the United States will have diabetes, correlating to a significant immunocompromised population and nearly 85 million patients subjected to loss of a limb as a result of a non-healing chronic wound. With this research, we will not only gain significant insight in to the basic biology of host-pathogen interactions within the chronic wound environment in diabetics, but will also lay the foundation for novel medical interventions predictive of wound healing."
"9468881","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The 10-member sarcomeric myosin heavy chain gene family has been studied extensively and mutations in half of its members have been implicated in disease. Myosin motors convert chemical energy into mechanical force by amplifying the ATP-driven conformational rotation of myosin?s lever arm, which consists of a helical pliant region and the ?-helix of the heavy chain stabilized and stiffened by essential and regulatory light chains; hereafter referred to as the lever arm. While a great deal of study has been devoted to the catalytic domain and converter, the lever arm has often been treated as simply a semi-rigid extension of the converter to amplify the stroke size of the motor. For a given isoform of myosin the entire lever arm is highly conserved across species, but it is highly variant amongst the 10 isoforms, suggesting that the sequences of lever arm ?- helices confer specific functions. Given the high sequence conservation of the ?-cardiac lever arm across species and the high density of pathogenic mutations in it, we hypothesize that this region is an important regulatory domain that modulates myosin function and testing that hypothesis is the focus of this proposal. We propose an interdisciplinary collaboration among the Spudich, Perkins and Leinwand laboratories to study the effects of disease-causing mutations in the lever arm by integrating the biophysical characterization of isolated lever arms and myosin motor functional assays with cardiac cell biology. In the previous grant period, the Leinwand, Spudich and Geeves laboratories produced and characterized a number of disease-causing mutations of the human ?-cardiac myosin motor for their biochemical and kinetic properties, but none of these studies included lever arm mutations. Because of clinical hypercontractility of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients and hypocontractility of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients, we hypothesize that HCM mutations will most likely increase the stiffness of the lever arm, whereas, DCM mutations will cause the lever arm to be less stiff. In Aim I, we will determine the biochemical and mechanical properties of the lever arm of WT ?-myosin using atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the elasticity of proteins in addition to probing their folding/unfolding dynamics. Until now, AFM technology did not have the resolution to study the mechanics of the 9-nm long lever arm. However, the Perkins lab?s recent advances in single-molecule AFM techniques will enable us to compare the mechanical properties of the WT ß-cardiac myosin lever arm ?-helix to ones carrying cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. In Aim II, we will measure the impact of the lever arm mutations on in vitro subfragment-1 (S1) motor function using ATPase, gliding filament and optical tweezer assays. Finally, in Aim III we will integrate these biophysical and biomechanical findings into cells by introducing WT and lever arm mutant full length ?-cardiac myosins into cardiac myocytes and determining their effects on sarcomere integrity, sarcomere dynamics and contractility."
"9424010","PROJECT SUMMARY Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and von Willebrand disease (VWF deficiency) are well recognized severe and/or common bleeding disorders that require frequent treatment with IV infusion of clotting factors ? FVIII and VWF respectively. Studies by our laboratory and others suggest a unique relationship between VWF and FVIII that will be explored further in this proposal. While prophylaxis to prevent bleeding is the current standard of care, this requires infusions several times a week. While gene therapy could be curative, studies in patients have yet to achieve adequate efficacy except in patients with hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). Over the past several years our laboratory has focused on delivering FVIII by targeting expression to the platelet so that FVIII is stored together with VWF and this approach results in therapeutic efficacy even in the presence of high titer FVIII inhibitors. The local release of the FVIII/VWF complex circumvents the immediate inactivation of FVIII and permits cessation of bleeding even in the face of high-titer FVIII inhibitory antibodies. In Aim-1 a second animal model has been developed to study the role of the VWF and FVIII complex in gene therapy of hemophilia A even in the context of FVIII inhibitors in a rat model that has both spontaneous bleeding, a high propensity to form FVIII inhibitory antibodies, and has a blood volume size that enables easy sequential sampling unlike the mouse where sequential time points require animal sacrifice rather than sequential phlebotomy. This can substantiate the efficacy of 2bF8 in an inhibitor prone model and potentially demonstrate efficacy in preventing spontaneous bleeding ? a characteristic that cannot be studied in the mouse or the dog were spontaneous bleeding is difficult to study. While it is well recognized that VWF prolongs the survival of FVIII, in Aim 2 we will explore the functional importance of this VWF delivering FVIII to the site of the evolving thrombus. In Aim 3 we will further study VWF and FVIII synthesis and the cells that produce them as a complex and as individual proteins. These three aims will further our understanding of the biologic role for the complex of FVIII and VWF in normal hemostasis and thrombosis and through these interactions offer a strategy for effectively treating hemophilia A subjects with FVIII inhibitors through a unique gene therapy strategy that ectopically expresses FVIII with VWF in platelets."
"9419813","Project Summary/Abstract There is a significant unmet clinical need to find effective analgesic drugs for the treatment of chronic pain that have fewer adverse effects, tolerance development, and abuse potential. We have identified a novel mixed efficacy opioid ligand (AAH8) that is highly effective for treating pain in animal models but does not produce tolerance or dependence when administered repeatedly. This compound appears to have minimal rewarding effects in an animal model. These data suggest that our candidate compound may be the ultimate opioid analgesic that produces significant pain relief with little risk of developing tolerance or addiction. AAH8 has equivalent affinity for mu and delta opioid receptors but it is a mu opioid receptor agonist and a delta opioid receptor antagonist and appears to cross the blood brain barrier. Blocking delta-opioid receptors has been proposed to alter the trafficking of mu-opioid receptors as related to desensitization, downregulation, and tolerance. While it is unusual to think that an effective mu-opioid analgesic would not have abuse potential, our preliminary data suggest that the mixed efficacy opioid ligand marks a significant improvement over current opioid analgesics, especially for treating chronic pain. Therefore, the long-term goal of the proposed work is to identify effective treatments for chronic pain with fewer adverse consequences associated with long term treatments. The objective here is to examine the effects of AAH8 in models of chronic pain, drug self- administration, and adverse side effects as compared with clinically used opioid analgesics. The overarching hypothesis is that AAH8 will have limited reinforcing effects in a drug self-administration assays and will retain efficacy in chronic pain assays. To accomplish this work, AAH8 will be evaluated in a chronic pain models and in drug self-administration assays in opioid-naïve and -experienced subjects to determine its reinforcing effects. Overall, this venture has the potential to identify a drug that would dramatically improve the treatment and management of chronic pain by reducing the hazards associated with long term opioid treatment."
"9417055","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop Cardio Thoracic Events and Decompensated heart failure (INVESTED) I s a multi-center, randomized, double blind, active-control trial of high dose influenza vaccine compared to standard dose influenza vaccine for three seasons in adult participants with a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure. The primary outcome measure is the composite of death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, and secondary outcomes include composite of cardiopulmonary death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization, all-cause death or all-cause hospitalization, all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, cardiopulmonary death, and all cause death. Background: The substantial number of individuals in North America with myocardial infarction or heart failure (HF) are at high risk for influenza infection and associated morbidity, mortality and increased health care costs despite annual influenza vaccination. Higher dose of vaccine is approved for use in older adults but not in patients with heart failure. Antibody-mediated immunity contributes to vaccine-induced protection from influenza illness. Preliminary data: Our research group has shown in a meta-analysis that influenza vaccine reduces the risk for cardiovascular events and has also demonstrated reduced antibody titers to influenza vaccination in patients with HF. Additionally, we've shown in a pilot study that double dose influenza vaccine resulted in increased titers and was well tolerated. Methods: A multi-center, randomized, double blinded randomized trial will be conducted with 4650 patients assigned to the standard dose vaccine dose and 4650 patients to high dose influenza vaccine. The primary outcome measure is the composite of death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization, assessed at the end of each influenza season. Secondary outcomes will include the composite of death or cardiovascular hospitalizations, death or all-cause hospitalizations, and mortality. The study will also examine associations between geometric mean antibody titers and risk for death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations. Significance: A positive trial may be able to provide crucial information to infom health care policy regarding optimal influenza vaccination dosing among individuals with high risk cardiovascular disease."
"9412842","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unlike to ion pump bacteriorhodopsin homologues, microbial sensory rhodopsin-transducer molecular complexes served a key paradigm for exploring the chemistry of protein-protein interaction in signaling cascade. In 2003, freshwater cyanobacterium Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120 revealed a chromosomal gene encoding a sensory rhodopsin analogue. In contrast to haloarchaeal sensory rhodopsin, it does not contain any membrane transducer gene product. However, an adjacent gene product is indicated to be a soluble transducer molecule for this photoreceptor. The detailed molecular mechanism of photoactivated receptor mediated signaling is not known. The proposed model is not related to any known microbial sensory based phototaxis. However, it is analogous to visual photoreceptor, rhodopsin and to other G- protein coupled signaling via cytoplasmic components. Thus the role of this soluble putative transducer protein may establish a novel mode of signaling as shared by haloarchaea and eukarya. Interestingly, this putative soluble transducer molecule is present in a series of microbial species that do not contain sensory rhodopisn photoreceptor. Sequential and structural fold homology reveals such molecule without any established functional feature. Genome database search revealed their presence in broad microbial population including various pathogens. The homologue sequence of a transducer present in other sequences is referred to as domain of unidentified function [DUF], family. This family includes pathogens, such as Tropheryma, Actinomyces and Thermobifida. The atomic resolution structures of both photoreceptor and putative transducer are available. Structural motif based bioinformatics analysis has revealed that the transducer homologue may be classified as a member of a super family of microbial small carbohydrate binding domain. It is likely that it may serve as a novel carbohydrate binding module in a unique beta sandwich framework. Our preliminary data, based on unipolar localization suggests strong correlation and affinity to bacterial cellulose synthesis proteins that specifically localizes at pole. Recent NMR study has shown a eukaryotic like interaction of this transducer with DNA. Further, sequence- based analysis prediction along with initial data from PI's work supports the phosphor-accepting property of the transducer protein. Additionally, the phosphorylation leads to impair the unusual stability of transducer, suggesting its putative role in signaling. The unusual stable assembly and its segregation of this putative transducer protein would elucidate the signaling state of this DUF protein molecule. This project is aimed to relate the functional state of transducer as a phosphor-acceptor module and presence of a sugar binding motif and characterize the modulation of such a feature on receptor binding. The characterization of transducer's signaling state would broaden our understanding towards other DUF members including various pathogens as well."
"9439570","This investigation tests the hypothesis that military occupation-specific exposures to silica and other inorganic dusts are associated with the prospective development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other rheumatic autoimmune diseases. There is ample support for this hypothesis from studies of civilian populations exposed to silica and other inorganic dusts, but this has never been studied in the military occupational context. The overarching Study Aim is to estimate the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other rheumatic diseases associated with military service exposure to inorganic dust using an established roster of OEF/OIF/OND veterans who have had any Veterans Administration Health Care System (VAHCS) contact. We will define exposure by linking categorized (coded) military duties to a job exposure matrix developed for this study. The disease outcomes of interest will be defined by VAHCS visits coded for RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and selected additional rheumatologic autoimmune conditions (such as systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, and vasculitis). Further diagnosis refinement will be supplemented by serologic data and natural language-based algorithms. We will analyze time until initial diagnosis for each target condition (Proportionate Hazards modeling) to estimate the risk of disease associated with military occupational exposure. We will adjust for key covariates, including sex, age, smoking, duration of service, and branch of service. We will limit study eligibility to full active duty military personnel (Reserve duty and National Guard members will not be included to better categorize exposure). After additional exclusions, we anticipate a cohort for analysis of 600,000 persons with approximately 2.4 million person years of VAHCS patient visits. Of the cohort, 25% will have had occupational assignments of higher; 18%, intermediate; and 57%, negligible exposure likelihood. In a preliminary logistic regression analysis in a subset of the cohort using RA as the outcome, we observed a 38% increased exposure-associated odds of disease (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.05-1.80). Based on these data, we conservatively estimate that we will have sufficient study power (alpha 0.05; beta 0.20) to detect exposure-related increase risk as low as 1.3 for RA and below 1.5 for SLE. RA, SLE, and other autoimmune rheumatic diseases within the population served by the VAHCS are well recognized as an important source of morbidity. It is now well established that inorganic dust inhalation is a factor consistently associated with increased risk of such diseases among civilian populations. Yet these two independent and important phenomena never have been considered in relation to one another. In short, the question has not been asked, can military service itself be a contributor to such diseases? The answer to this question is critical to risk reduction, case identification, effective treatment, and potentially, and primary prevention."
"9394797","PROJECT SUMMARY Although the health benefits of physical activity in prevention and mitigation of many chronic diseases have been documented for decades, the molecular mechanisms mediating these health benefits are still poorly understood. To understand the adaptive response of physical activity at the molecular level, it is essential to comprehensively characterize the dynamic changes in protein expression and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in tissues and circulating biofluids. The overall objective of the PNNL Proteomics Chemical Analysis Center for MoTrPAC (ProMoTr) is to support the consortium by providing comprehensive discovery and subsequent targeted verification analyses of circulating protein factors in blood and associated PTMs in multiple tissue types collected by the Pre-clinical Animal Study Sites and Clinical Centers of MoTrPAC. To develop a `molecular map' of transducers that provide the impacts of physical activity in humans, the ProMoTr's integrative proteomics analysis plan has two major foci. First, we will focus on the circulating secreted factors found in blood plasma and tissues based on the known cross-talk between and within tissues resulting from physical activity. Second, we will investigate the tissue- and cellular- level response to physical activity by assessing intracellular signaling as mediated by protein PTMs, including protein phosphorylation, reversible redox modifications, and lysine acetylation and acylation. The Specific Aims of ProMoTr are: 1) to provide the Proteomics Chemical Analysis Element to discover and verify circulating factors and intracellular molecular transducers; 2) to provide the Bioinformatics Element to fully support the needs of ProMoTr in statistical design, data processing, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination; 3) to provide the Administrative Element to oversee internal activities and to provide high-level collaborative interactions with MoTrPAC centers and the broader consortium. The feasibility of performing high quality reproducible discovery and verification analyses on the scale of tens of thousands of tissue samples is built upon PNNL's record of accomplishment of large-scale integrative proteomics programs. The PNNL foundation includes refined quality control, large-scale computation, and dissemination capabilities, our recognized expertise in the development and deployment of cutting-edge mass spectrometry-based technologies, and our capabilities for studying protein PTMs that are closely linked with energy metabolism."
"9466239","VDI Project Summary/Abstract:   The NIH Division of Cell Biology and Biophysics supports studies of the biological macromolecules that affect the function and structure of living cells, and often play a role in disease. Within the realm of biophysics, one of the most important tools to study the structure and interactions of these molecules is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). For example, NMR has been used to study the oligomeric forms of amyloid-? that are that are critical to understanding the development of Alzheimer's disease. Also, NMR allows study of the structure of membrane proteins for use as potential pharmaceutical targets.  Cleary, NMR is an extremely powerful scientific tool, however, the technique is not simple and the measurements can be expensive and time consuming. This is primarily because the NMR signal is weak and requires sensitive receivers and long integration times for reliable detection. Within the field of NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a well-known technique to greatly increase the signal strength. Most DNP systems rely on a Gyrotron to generate the required microwave power. Although Gyrotrons generate sufficient power, they are incapable of generating the short pulses and modulated signals desired for advanced DNP systems. Also, their cost is prohibitive for all but the most well-funded laboratories.  The key focus of this project is to advance solid-state (SS) source technology to the point where it can begin to replace the Gyrotrons for a significant proportion of DNP-NMR measurements, thereby lowering the barriers to entry into this field and accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.  The Phase I effort is focused on demonstrating that recent technological innovations can be used to significantly increase the power and functionality of the SS sources for DNP. The first objective is to demonstrate an innovative frequency doubler design that is expected to generate greater than 200 mW at 263 GHz. This is a significant milestone not only because it will increase the range of measurements possible with a SS source, but also because it is sufficient to fully pump the emerging traveling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, which can increase the power to the several watts. The second objective is to generate short pulses and complex waveforms with accurate phase and frequency modulation. This is an important milestone because such control of the microwave signal can significantly increase the NMR signal without requiring increased power. The final Phase I objective is to develop the general research plan for Phase II that will lead to watt level power at 263 GHz, extension of the technology to other frequencies of interest, and the implementation of the pulse and modulation controls into a system optimized for DNP- NMR research."
"9598809","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cholera has become endemic in multiple sites around the globe and can cause devastating local epidemics, such as Zimbabwe in 2008-2009 and Haiti in 2010-2012. In the last 50 years, the scienti?c understanding of cholera transmission has emphasized infection from the environment. Recently, evidence has accumulated that person-to-person transmission may play an important role in endemic and epidemic cholera. Vibrio cholerae strains sampled from humans often do not match well with strains sampled from the environment, and Vibrio cholerae excreted from human patients is in a transient hyperinfective state with an infectious dose 10-100 times lower than that not recently passed through humans. An emerging hypothesis is that environmental reservoirs and slow human-environment-human transmission pathways maintain cholera reservoirs and spark epidemics but fast human-to-human transmission drives the explosive growth of epidemics. If true, this hypothesis would justify increased emphasis on interventions targeted to households or other close contact groups of cholera cases for the control of endemic and epidemic cholera. Despite its potential importance to public health, much of the evidence for this hypothesis is circumstantial. The long-term goal is to test this hypothesis and to understand its implications for cholera control and study design. The goal of the proposed research is to re-analyze longitudinal cholera incidence data from the households of index cases using semiparametric regression models for infectious disease transmission. These models allow the estimation of hazard ratios for infectiousness and susceptibility without making parametric assumptions about the time course of infectiousness in infected individuals. Compared to previous statistical methods for the analysis of household transmission data, these models are more robust, more ?exible, and more numerically stable. These methods also have the potential to incorporate pathogen genetic sequence data, which is being collected in several ongoing cholera studies and may allow more precise estimation of transmission parameters. This research is innovative because it applies novel statistical methods to test an important hypothesis in public health. It is signi?cant because understanding the role of person-to-person transmission will be crucial to the effective control of endemic and epidemic cholera."
"9408662","ABSTRACT? PROJECT 2 ? PRECLINICAL MODEL FOR ANTIEPILEPTOGENIC THERAPY SCREENING IN POST-TRAUMATIC EPILEPSY There is currently no validated antiepileptogenic therapy for acquired epilepsies, such as post-traumatic epilepsy. Despite the grave human cost of post-traumatic epilepsy, undertaking the effort to perform a clinical antiepileptogenesis trial is currently hugely difficult, due to the significant cost, time to follow up, and very high numbers of subjects needed to treat to eventually observe antiepileptogenic effect. The availability of a biomarker that predicts, at an early stage, who will develop epilepsy and who might benefit from the antiepileptogenic effect of a treatment would significantly accelerate and de-risk the process of identifying an antiepileptogenic therapy. Furthermore, the concern that animal studies report several promising discoveries that do not always translate into clinically relevant findings has discouraged efforts to sponsor rigorous antiepileptogenesis trials in humans, when there is a significant risk of failure. In this study, Project 2 of the EpiBioS4Rx Center Without Walls, we aim to create a rigorous and effective preclinical model to screen antiepileptogenic therapies for posttraumatic epilepsy by trying to fill two important gaps (a) identify and validate a biomarker of posttraumatic epileptogenesis that can predict the antiepileptogenic effect of a treatment and (b) enhance the reproducibility of the study by creating the first multicenter, double-blinded, vehicle controlled, randomized preclinical antiepileptogenesis study following the high standards of rigor advocated by NINDS, the AES/ILAE Translational Research Task Force and the ARRIVE guidelines. We have formed a collaborative group of four international preclinical testing centers (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, University of Melbourne, UCLA, University of Eastern Finland), supported by experts in pharmacokinetic modeling (University of Minnesota), and experts in peripheral electrophysiology and imaging biomarker discovery, as well as neurotherapeutics. A preclinical Data Safety Monitoring Board will be overseeing the progress and advise on strategies and the preparation of a clinical cohort for the future clinical trial. We have selected 5 novel treatments that target different mechanisms and using a multimodal screening process for target engagement and modification of candidate biomarkers of posttraumatic epileptogenesis, we aim to identify (a) at least one treatment to screen in this rigorous model for its antiepileptogenic potential, and (b) at least one biomarker of posttraumatic epileptogenesis that can predict early the antiepileptogenic effect. Our investigators work closely with Project 1 (discovery of biomarkers of epileptogenesis in animals), Project 3 (discovery of biomarkers of epileptogenesis in humans), the Informatics and Analytics Core, and the Public Engagement Core."
"9419198","PROJECT SUMMARY: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are highly prevalent (affecting over 15 million women annually in the United States), tend to recurrence and/or chronicity and are increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment. Recent work suggests a ?Lock and Key? paradigm in which UTI susceptibility is governed by complex interactions of dynamic host susceptibility determinants and diverse bacterial urovirulence potentials that are driven not only by gene content but also by differences in the expression and regulation of conserved functions. Further, catheterization of the urinary tract increases susceptibility to infection by bacteria that do not usually cause UTIs in immunocompetent people, including highly antibiotic resistant strains such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, a prominent member of the carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae. This proposal will assess the mechanisms by which urinary catheters affect acute UTI susceptibility and long-term pathophysiology in the urinary tract (UT). Short-term urinary catheterization increases the risk of UTI and other complications up to 80%, and prolonged catheterization increases the risk to 100%. In mouse models of catheter associated UTI (CAUTI), urinary catheterization itself results in the wounding of the bladder epithelium, leading to inflammation and fibrinogen release. Fibrinogen and other host proteins are deposited on catheters in both mice and human patients. Enterococcus, a common cause of CAUTI, binds this deposited fibrinogen via the EbpA adhesin to mediate catheter adherence, biofilm formation and UT colonization, even though Enterococcus cannot directly bind the catheter. This proposal tests the hypothesis that implanted catheters increase host susceptibility to UTI by diverse potential pathogens via wounding the uroepithelium, triggering inflammation and providing novel surfaces for bacterial binding. In addition, available data suggest that inflammation and epithelial wounding due to chronic cystitis remodels the bladder mucosa, rendering it more susceptible to subsequent infection. Continual wounding due to long-term catheterization may also result in bladder mucosal remodeling and increased infection susceptibility. This proposal aims to use histological, biochemical and genetic approaches in combination with representative mouse models and human clinical samples to: i) assess the effects of catheter implantation on infection susceptibility and determine host and bacterial factors important in CAUTI; ii) investigate the host proteins and diverse bacterial adhesins that mediate binding to and biofilm formation on implanted catheters and; iii) ascertain mucosal remodeling effects of prolonged foreign body residence in the UT. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the increased sensitivity to infection of the UT due to catheterization will give insights into the development of more effective therapies, which are sorely needed due to the spread of multidrug resistant uropathogens."
"9612719","Synthetic lethal approaches for `personalized' therapy of specific cancer subsets is a strategy that can attack the initial drivers of genetic instability, possibly eliminating tumor heterogeneity, as well as the emergence of resistant and metastatic cancer cells. We recently discovered that cancer cells that lost one allele of the RPRD1B/Kub5-Hera (K-H) gene, corresponding to ~50% loss of protein, exhibit atypical elevations of PARP1 activities and a ?BRCAness? phenotype in BRCA-proficient cancer cells. We hypothesize that K-H binds to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to preferentially direct transcription of genes containing sequence-specific CHR-motif promoters, most importantly cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). CDK1, in turn, stimulates BRCA1 phosphorylation and HR function. K-H loss in breast or NSCLC cancers, by copy number variation (CNV), mRNA expression or specific SNPs in patient tumors, results in a unique `cancer vulnerability of persistent R-loop formation and HR deficiency', whereby cells are dependent on PARP1-driven alternative non-homologous end joining (alt-NHEJ) repair. While this drives genetic instability due to elevated R-loops, a BRCA deficiency and a dependency on error-prone alt-NHEJ, the `vulnerability in genetic instability' can be exploited using PARP inhibitors (PARPis) that block redundant DSB repair and cause lethality during replication. Two specific aims will be completed. Specific Aim 1: To perform structure/function analyses using rationally-derived K-H mutation(s) and patient-derived tumor SNPs to delineate the mechanism by which aberrant K-H mutations alter PARP1 activity and CDK1 levels that, in turn, affect downstream BRCA1-HR function and cellular responses to PARP1is or IR. (Years 1-5). Specific Aim 2: To optimize antitumor efficacy of breast or NSCLC cancer xenografts expressing K- H copy number/protein loss using clinically-relevant PARPis or IR (Years 1-5). Completion of the proposed research will define the mechanism by which K-H directs RNAPII-driven CHR motif-specific gene expression and CDK1-BRCA1 HR function. In turn, understanding this mechanism will allow exploitation of the consequences of K-H loss and optimization of synthetic lethal approaches using PARPis or IR for treatment of specific cancer subsets. The studies will also reveal additional, exploitable cancer vulnerabilities. Our studies are novel as they define how a RNA transcription termination factor can direct transcription and DNA repair, revealing exploitable cancer vulnerabilities that can be translated."
"9415545","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The scientific theme of the proposed Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) is that molecular and genetic analysis of diseases that involve the skeleton will lead to a better understanding of their causes and will support development of novel therapies. Four research projects, each led by a junior investigator, will investigate different conditions that lead to damage of the musculoskeletal system. Each of these projects will employ high-throughput technologies to generate large datasets for genome-wide characterization of experimental samples. These datasets will contribute to deep molecular characterization and enable comprehensive monitoring of cellular processes and advance understanding of biological systems. However, the amount of data generated is vast, its dimensionality is high, and it is typically difficult to handle. Therefore, effective extraction of meaningful information from these datasets will require personnel with the appropriate expertise and access to the necessary computational facilities. To address these needs, we will establish a new Bioinformatics Core at UAMS for computational analyses of large data sets that assembles the personnel, equipment, and computational algorithms required to meet the needs of the Project Leaders and CMDR members (Aim 1). We will provide bioinformatics services to these investigators and develop customized new services to meet their evolving needs via custom bioinformatics analysis pipelines derived from up-to-date computational algorithms and biological knowledge databases that fit the needs of the specific research project (Aim 2). We will also provide training and education related to the use of bioinformatics so that Project Leaders and other users will be better able to understand and use the principles and concepts of bioinformatics methods related to their research subjects (Aim 3). The Bioinformatics Core will consist of personnel who have strong bioinformatics skills, appropriate biological knowledge, and experience working with biologists. The team will provide advanced bioinformatics/systems biology guidance and analyses at all stages of genome-wide experiments. Project Leaders and other CMDR members will acquire bioinformatic skills and expertise that will have long-term benefits for them individually and the Center as a whole. In the short- term, the Bioinformatics Core will enable Project Leaders to rapidly and efficiently integrate the results obtained from the other CMDR cores: the Genetic Models Core (Core B) and the Bone Histology and Imaging Core (Core C). In turn, bioinformatic analyses will prompt the creation of new genetic models and guide interpretation of imaging and histologic analyses. This iterative process will result in synergy that would be difficult to achieve without the coordinated leadership and access provided by the CMDR. Overall, access to the Bioinformatics Core's cutting-edge resources, and the critical mass of investigators that it supports, will greatly strengthen the research communities at UAMS and in Arkansas."
"9427037","Project Summary  CRISPR-Cas9 is revolutionizing the life sciences through its RNA-guided ability to target individual genes for disruption or for precise editing. In addition to accelerating basic research and biotechnology, Cas9 and its RNA guides also have the potential to transform the treatment of inherited diseases via genome editing-based cures, especially if delivery hurdles can be overcome and clinical safety can be proven. There are three subtypes of Cas9 systems (Types II-A, -B and -C), and all three have yielded Cas9 orthologs with demonstrated utility in mammalian genome editing. Our own work has established the Type II-C Cas9 from N. meningitidis (NmeCas9) as a compact, naturally hyperaccurate genome editing platform. Some of the safety concerns in Cas9?s clinical development arise from Cas9 activity that is excessive, prolonged, or present in unintended cell types. These concerns have been heightened by a shortage of effective tools that inactivate Cas9 proteins after completion of the intended editing, or that prevent Cas9 activity altogether at undesired times or in unintended tissues.  We recently discovered natural Cas9 inhibitors [anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins] that evolved as counter- measures against CRISPR immunity. We have identified and validated five distinct families of Acrs from bacterial species with Type II-C CRISPR-Cas systems, and established their efficacy as off-switches for NmeCas9 genome editing in human cells. Our proven strategies have also led us to additional Acr candidates that are likely inhibitors of distinct Type II-C Cas9 orthologs. Our discoveries therefore provide us with a powerful entrée into addressing the limitations and safety concerns that arise from uncontrolled or otherwise unwanted Cas9 activity.  In this proposal, we outline experiments that exploit our discovery of Cas9 inhibitors in three ways. In Aim 1, we will use Acr phylogenetic distributions as pointers towards orthologous, robust, compact Type II-C Cas9 genome-editing systems, each of which would be immediately amenable to off-switch control. Because distinct Cas9s often have novel targeting specificities, this work also promises to expand the genomic scope of Cas9 editing. In Aim 2, we will optimize Acr inhibitory potency, and test the hypothesis that Acrs can be used to increase the efficiency of precise editing via homology-dependent repair. Finally, in Aim 3, we will establish tissue-specific Acr control over genome editing in a model mammal (the mouse), and use it to develop a flexible platform for restricting Cas9 genome editing to a single desired tissue following systemic Cas9 delivery by adeno-associated virus. Our strategy for enforcing tissue specificity of gene editing will be applicable even to cell types in which AAV-compatible tissue-specific promoters are unavailable for driving Cas9 expression.  The proposed research promises to yield enhanced genome-editing systems with broader targeting range, fewer safety risks and improved tissue specificity, which we will demonstrate pre-clinically in mice."
"9537240","Project Summary Abstract: Influenza vaccination is the most effective means of preventing influenza virus infection and its more severe complications. Due to the changing nature of influenza viruses, active surveillance alongside regular updating of vaccine components and annual vaccination are necessary for vaccine protection. There is a need for annual evaluation of vaccine effectiveness (VE), which may vary from year to year. These estimates are critical to inform the medical community, maintain public confidence in the vaccine, and determine the effect of virus drift on protection. Modern study designs to assess VE require laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, sensitive and specific measures of vaccine receipt, and the use of a case test-negative design to control for differences in healthcare-seeking behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We propose to use these methods to estimate influenza VE in preventing influenza-associated ambulatory care visits in two health systems in Michigan, where we have been conducting annual assessments of VE since 2008. We will conduct surveillance at adult and pediatric outpatient clinics, and we will enroll patients seeking care for acute respiratory infections meeting a standard case definition. Vaccination status will be reported and documented, and considered with laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to estimate VE in preventing influenza- associated health care visits. Analyses will use the case test-negative design; those testing positive for influenza will be cases, those testing negative will be controls. Modifiers and confounders of VE such as age, health status, high-risk health conditions, education, time from illness onset to specimen collection, and calendar time will be assessed. We will also estimate the population-based incidence of medically-attended influenza and will identify infections due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory viruses in later years of the study. We will pilot methods to monitor the development of influenza virus resistance to antiviral medications which could inform similar studies carried out in a potential future influenza pandemic. In addition to our proposed influenza surveillance and VE assessment in the outpatient setting, we propose to continue our analyses of influenza VE and development of influenza antibodies among a prospectively followed cohort of households with children which has been in place since 2010. This cohort will be used to carry out complementary analyses of VE in preventing influenza illnesses of any severity which will be identified through ongoing active surveillance. Households in this cohort are followed for multiple years, enabling precise evaluations of repeated vaccination. Our current enrollment strategies will be augmented with targeted enrollment of households with children under age 3. Blood specimens will be collected from adults and children twice yearly; a third blood specimen will be collected from children < 3 years old 4 weeks after vaccination. The proposed work will enable the continuation of our established, coordinated, multi-faceted evaluation of influenza VE and development of antibodies in both ambulatory and community settings."
"9537235","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elderly suffer the majority of influenza hospitalizations and deaths and are a priority for determining influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). The Univ. of Pittsburgh and UPMC Health System (UPMC) are located in Allegheny County (AC), in which influenza is reportable & which has one of the 5 oldest populations in the U.S. We propose a test-negative case-control study of influenza VE in 2 UPMC hospitals to determine VE against hospitalizations of adults. UPMC has been on the US News honor roll for over a decade, including most wired and has a strong research tradition. The influenza season will be determined from syndromic surveillance from multiple hospital EDs, the Health Dept. (ACHD), & from lab data from >14,000 respiratory viral panels (RVP) done annually at UPMC. Theradoc informatics will identify adult inpatients who have had an RVP conducted. Enrollees' survey data will be directly entered into NIH's REDCap. Frailty can be assessed by survey and/or electronic medical record (EMR) data (e.g., Charleson Co-morbidity Index) to assess confounders and effect modifiers. Our Data Center manages REDCap data, EMR data from hospitalizations, & immunization data for uploading to CDC. Population-based incidence of influenza hospitalizations will be determined from ACHD and UPMC St. Margaret hospitalization data and by agent-based modeling at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Our team is a strong candidate for this project because: 1) UPMC is the dominant regional health system with a strong bond rating; 2) infection control personnel recommend RVPs to establish diagnoses, and our team's leadership responsibilities at the hospitals can further influence the use of RVPs; 3) we have published data showing excellent concordance between UPMC's GenMark RVP and the CDC's PCR for detecting influenza; 4) research shows better protection in the elderly from high-dose influenza (HD) vaccine; UPMC has recommended and promoted HD vaccine in large quantities, although regular vaccine is available, allowing for vaccine type comparisons; 5) UPMC's EMR links inpatient and outpatient vaccination records, and interfaces with the state immunization registry; 6) it includes diverse, well-published investigators who have worked together previously."
"9582648","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer is one of the top ten most common cancers in the U.S., contributing to over 60,000 new cases and 10,000 deaths annually. The majority of cases (70-80%) are diagnosed at early stage (termed non-muscle invasive), yet the cancer typically recurs (50-80%), with a subset further progressing to muscle- invasive disease with poor survival. Due to this markedly high recurrence and progression, patients are followed intensively by cystoscopy with repeat transurethral manipulation, making bladder cancer one of the most costly diseases. Cruciferous vegetable intake has been associated with reduced risk of primary bladder cancer and improved survival, which might be partly attributable to their unique phytochemical isothiocyanates (ITCs). Dietary ITCs are promising chemopreventive agents with multi-faceted anti-cancer mechanisms. Our prior in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiologic studies strongly support dietary ITCs and ITC-rich cruciferous vegetables playing a key role in preventing bladder cancer recurrence and progression and improving prognosis. Above all, via metabolic pathways in humans, orally ingested ITCs are rapidly delivered to the bladder and concentrated in the urine, rendering bladder cancer the best target for their anti-cancer activities.  This application requests to conduct a new prospective cohort study of 1,811 newly diagnosed non- muscle invasive bladder cancer patients in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and Southern California (KPSC) Medical Care Programs. Our goal is to comprehensively examine the role of cruciferous vegetable intake, in conjunction with genetic polymorphisms related to ITC metabolism, in potentially reducing disease recurrence and progression, and increasing the efficacy of intravesical treatment. We propose to investigate: 1) the associations between cruciferous vegetable intake and bladder cancer recurrence and progression; 2) the modifying effect of polymorphisms of ITC-metabolizing genes on the associations between cruciferous vegetable intake and bladder cancer recurrence and progression; and 3) the effects of the interactions between cruciferous vegetable intake and therapeutic agents on bladder cancer recurrence and progression. Furthermore, we propose to establish the largest prospective cohort of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients with longitudinal questionnaire data and banked biospecimens for further future research of bladder cancer outcomes including survival and quality of life.  Bladder cancer is an extremely understudied disease considering its disproportionate high incidence and recurrence, high cost of clinical management, and significant impact on quality of life. The proposed study within one of the largest U.S. integrated health care settings will be the first to investigate the role of dit in recurrence and progression of the disease, with genetic profiles taken into consideration to identify those who will benefit most. Considering the wide availability of cruciferous vegetables in the U.S., this study could have an immediate impact on bladder cancer prognosis."
"9417492","Approximately 15 million Americans suffer from asthma, which leads to about 4000 deaths per year, and is responsible for estimated annual total direct and indirect costs of $56 billion. Despite the existing treatments for asthma, predominantly combinations of inhaled ?2-agonists and corticosteroids (CSs), there remains a significant unmet medical need for new therapies which address two key issues: 1) approximately 10% of patients are insensitive to current medicines; and 2) a significant number of patients (up to 50%) have adherence challenges with the inhaled drugs, due to inhaler misuse, lack of use and/or side-effects. There is compelling evidence implicating T-helper 2 (Th2) cells in asthma via: i) the induction and maintenance of inflammation and ii) the progression to the morphological changes associated with chronic disease. Also, there is growing published support that acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase), a member of the chitinase family of hydrolases, contributes to the Th2-driven inflammatory responses, tissue injury and remodeling associated with diseases such as asthma. Hypothesis: We thus hypothesize that an oral AMCase inhibitor will alter the pattern of inflammation in CS-insensitive asthmatics, may augment the response to CSs in severe asthmatics and will also be effective in Th2-mediated asthma, as well as avoiding the adherence issues with inhaled medicines. Innovation: Our company (OncoArendi Therapeutics) initiated a Drug Discovery Program focused on developing potent and selective, orally active AMCase inhibitors for asthma and other Th2-associated diseases. After synthesizing and testing more than 500 compounds, we have selected a clinical candidate to progress into development for asthma. Our lead candidate OAT-889 is very selective, has high potency, excellent oral bioavailability in rodents, with long terminal half-life, low clearance and high volume of distribution, and activity in two standard models of asthma. In addition, OAT-889 has moderate plasma protein binding across species, no significant inhibition of CYP enzymes or hERG, and is negative in the Ames genotoxicity test. OAT-889 has first-in-class potential, with no known competition from other BioPharmaceutical companies. We propose to file an IND for this novel oral small molecule AMCase inhibitor as a critical step towards the clinical development of this innovative asset to treat moderate-to-severe asthma patients. The major goals of this Fast-track proposal are: Phase I. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the effects of the clinical candidate, OAT-889, in a murine chronic model of asthma involving exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus, which is not sensitive to inhaled CSs. Phase II. Specific Aim 1: Translational medicine studies in human lung. Specific Aim 2: File an IND for OAT-889 after completing the standard IND-enabling studies. OAT-889 is the first of a new class of oral compounds, AMCase inhibitors, which have the potential to manage patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who are not adequately controlled by current medicines, while significantly improving treatment adherence compared to standard inhaled therapy."
"9538334","Project Summary/Abstract  Most prostate cancer deaths are due to failed treatment response or to metastasis, particularly to bone. We have been studying the mechanisms responsible for treatment failure using genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) that recapitulate key features of advanced prostate cancer, including castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and aggressive-variant CRPC with neuroendocrine differentiation (CRPC-NE), and that develop highly penetrant metastatic prostate cancer including to bone, which is the primary site of metastasis in humans. Using novel cross-species computational approaches, we have shown that the mechanisms underlying disease progression in these GEMMs are conserved with human prostate cancer, while drug response in GEMMs can be predictive of drug response in humans. Among our major findings, we have shown that GEMMs based on combined loss-of-function of Pten and p53 (NPp53), which are frequently co-mutated in human CRPC, model key phenotypic and molecular features of treatment-induced aggressive variant CRPC. Not only do these NPp53 mice fail to respond to treatment with anti-androgens, treatment actually accelerates disease progression, which we have called exceptional non-responders. Furthermore, we have shown that the treatment-induced neuroendocrine phenotype (CRPC-NE) of these exceptional non-responders is related to lineage plasticity.  Thus, our proposed studies will test the hypotheses that: (i) co-clinical analyses of GEMMs and human prostate cancer can elucidate biological and molecular mechanisms of drug response, and (ii) lineage plasticity is an important novel mechanism of drug resistance. In Aim 1 we will perform co-clinical investigations capitalizing on our GEMMs that model key aspects of advanced prostate cancer, and complemented with analyses of human prostate cancer organoid models. We will evaluate the efficacy of clinically-relevant drugs and drug combinations, focusing on those that: (a) counteract cellular plasticity associated with treatment resistance in CRPC; and (b) target bone metastasis. In Aim 2, we will investigate molecular mechanisms of drug response leveraging our genome-wide regulatory networks that enable cross-species integration between data from GEMMs and human prostate cancer. We will focus on identifying ?treatment response regulators? that inform on response to: (i) lineage plasticity and/or (ii) bone metastasis. In Aim 3 we will identify novel drivers of advanced prostate cancer using a forward genetic screening approach. Toward this end, we have undertaken a genetic screen utilizing the Sleeping Beauty (SB) murine transposon-based system, and have shown that mice harboring the activated transposon display accelerated lethal prostate cancer phenotypes. Taken together, the successful implementation of these Aims will identify tumor contexts that are responsive to drug treatment and molecular mechanisms of drug response, and will identify new targets for intervention."

"9408643","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Science Workforce Analysis and Modeling: Understanding the Contributions of Social and Behavioral Sciences to Health Outcomes. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognizes that a robust science workforce is required to achieve national research and development goals. This renewal application develops and applies systems modeling frameworks to the science workforce, focusing on the portion of the social and behavioral workforce working to improve health outcomes. The goal is to identify policy levers to improve the science workforce for NIH and to provide practical guidance to decision makers tasked with improving the staffing of our nation's health maintenance and health care workforce. The research will use systems modeling to understand the relationships between individuals, institutions and policies in the science workforce. The research will employ combination of systems approaches, mathematical models, and data analyses. Data will be drawn from many sources including federal panel data such as the Survey of Earned Doctorates, institutional data from universities and federal agencies, and publically available data. In collaboration with NIH staff, and the advisory board for the Science Workforce Analysis and Modeling (SWAM), our research team plans to conduct research into key questions that are important to NIH's ability to understand how to assemble the science workforce for tomorrow. Researchers will first analyze the number of faculty positions in social and behavioral science fields to better understand the creation of new opportunities for researchers. Second, the research team will assess the impact of NIH funding levels on the research awards, productivity of the research, and impact on science workforce. Third, using data from individual institutions, research will examine the production of new graduates in social and behavioral science fields and their subsequent assimilation into the contributing science workforce. Finally, most likely using agent-based modeling, the researchers will design and build a dynamic model of the science workforce system, helping to understand how individual choices and institutional policies interact with each other to produce the most qualified workforce for the future of the nation. Whenever possible, the analyses at all levels will consider issues of workforce diversity and associated policy levels to improve outcomes in merit-based settings. Through models, leaders at NIH and the government can understand programs designed to improve the workforce, as well as describe the tradeoffs and unanticipated results of policies. Models of the science workforce must take into account the fact that the workforce of tomorrow depends both on changes to inputs that NIH has some control over (such as research funding) and social or economic realities that agencies can not readily influence."
"9434798","PROJECT SUMMARY Acute inflammatory lung diseases affect over 450 million people worldwide each year. Pathologic hallmarks include neutrophil accumulation, alveolar epithelial and endothelial cell injury, and loss of epithelial-capillary integrity. For alveolar repair to occur, inflammation must be halted, debris and inflammatory cells removed, injured tissue cells replaced, and capillary barrier function re-established. Macrophages are key players in all of these. The primary objective of this proposal is to create a Program in Lung Macrophage Biology that will determine how lung macrophages are programmed to halt inflammation and promote alveolar repair. A concept at the heart of the proposal is that of macrophage subsets. During health, the airspaces are occupied by a stable population of resident alveolar macrophages (RAM) that arise during embryogenesis and self-renew throughout life. RAMs remain during inflammation but are joined by recruited macrophages (RecM) that mature from circulating monocytes. These RecM remain in the lungs until alveolar function is restored, and then in most cases undergo apoptosis. However, in certain situations RecM escape apoptosis. We have shown that this is associated with the development of fibrosis. The precise roles played by RAMs vs RecM in the resolution of inflammation and promotion of tissue repair remain largely unknown. However, our data suggest that their respective roles are very different. In this context, the Program in Lung Macrophage Biology will explore 3 complementary themes. Theme 1 tests the hypothesis that RecM apoptosis is essential for the resolution of inflammation and that delayed apoptosis leads to fibrosis. The mechanisms that regulate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway and the intracellular proteins that block it will be studied. Theme 2 tests the hypothesis that binding of airway-derived mucins to Siglecs (a class of sialic acid-binding receptors with immunoinhibitory function) expressed on macrophages calibrates macrophage inflammatory responses. Theme 3 provides a tight link with the other themes and explores how cellular metabolism regulates macrophage inflammatory and pro-reparative functions and how it regulates survival of macrophage subsets. In this context, we propose that RecM preferentially use glycolysis as an energy source, whereas RAMs have increased utilization of the TCA cycle. HIF-1a is stabilized in RecM and is viewed as a central metabolic regulator. The 3 themes are further linked by their focus on differential functions of RAM vs RecM, the utilization of fresh human macrophages and shared use of cutting edge technologies. The Program leverages a multidisciplinary team of highly accomplished investigators, novel transgenic animal systems that we have developed, and a strong clinical research component. The latter includes whole human lungs obtained from donors that died with ARDS, bronchoscopy specimens from patients with ARDS, and LPS exposure studies with healthy human volunteers."
"9625832","Ozone (O3) causes lung injury, exacerbates chronic pulmonary diseases, and increases susceptibility to respiratory infections. Epidemiological studies strongly associate air pollution exposures and incidence of respiratory infections, which is important since more than 1/3 of the United States population lives in areas exceeding the current O3 regulatory standards. Though O3 exposure clearly impairs pulmonary host defense, the specific molecular mechanisms enhancing respiratory pathogen susceptibility remain poorly understood. Defining these mechanisms requires linking molecular pathways modified by environmental pollutants to those critical to host- pathogen interactions. The scavenger receptor families are such a molecular pathway. In this proposal, we plan to study the scavenger receptor CD163 in O3-induced alterations of pulmonary immunity. CD163 is a class B scavenger receptor, expressed on monocytes and macrophages, which exists in both membrane-bound and soluble (sCD163) forms. Membrane CD163 clears cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) by recognizing and internalizing hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. Once recognized by CD163, the complex is degraded by heme-oxygenase-1 into anti-inflammatory byproducts. Delayed CFH clearance augments inflammatory responses, exacerbates lung diseases, and modifies macrophage phagocytosis and apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis) resulting in persistent inflammation and defective pathogen clearance. Defining the role of CD163 in O3-mediated macrophage functions could uncover a novel mechanism mediating O3-induced adverse health effects. Our preliminary studies indicate that CD163 expression is upregulated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) macrophages from human subjects undergoing acute laboratory O3 exposure. Supporting the human data, mice exposed to O3 have increased BAL macrophage CD163 expression and BALF CFH. O3-exposed CD163 deficient mice demonstrate increased lung injury, neutrophilia and frequency of airspace apoptotic neutrophils. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that macrophage-dependent clearance of CFH is mediated by CD163, a mechanism that limits acute lung injury after O3, and maintains effective efferocytosis and pathogen phagocytosis. The studies proposed will define: 1) how CD163 limits pulmonary inflammation by promoting efferocytosis; and 2) how CD163 clearance of CFH maintains macrophage phagocytosis of pathogens. These studies are translational; integrating murine and human samples/observations. Completion of these studies would define a novel molecular pathway for O3-induced health effects and define a specific mechanism by which ambient pollutants mediate critical macrophage functions. Furthermore, studies with sCD163 could identify a therapeutic to mitigate O3-induced susceptibility to pulmonary infections."
"9432455","Project Summary/Abstract The overarching goals of this proposal are to contribute to the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and potential strategies for prevention of the international epidemic of chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKDu). Our central hypothesis is that CKDu results from the combined effects of dehydration and exposure to nephrotoxins, due to enhanced reabsorption of nephrotoxins into the renal tubules during periods of recurrent dehydration. Access to a large population of sugarcane workers in cooperation with a major Guatemalan agribusiness will allow for a study that characterizes and determines the contribution of occupational and environmental risk factors and that also evaluates subclinical kidney responses using biomarkers of early biological change in CKDu. This research will: a) identify occupational, environmental, and lifestyle factors that place agricultural workers at risk for the development of CKDu by conducting robust environmental and biological exposure assessments and b) examine underlying mechanisms by which dehydration contributes to increased risk of CKDu in conjunction with nephrotoxic exposures. To address this hypothesis, two aims are proposed: Aim 1 focuses on identifying sources of nephrotoxic exposure and risk factors for renal damage in Guatemalan sugarcane workers, using prospective, quantitative environmental and biological exposure assessments. Aim 2 will evaluate biomarkers of effect, including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and copeptin as markers of early biological change, in order to identify workers with increased risk of worsening renal function. The proposed study is both case-control and prospective cohort in design. First, it will collect baseline questionnaire and clinical data and biological samples from individuals with either reduced kidney function (n=75) or normal kidney function (n=100) applying for field work employment at a sugarcane plantation in southwest Guatemala. In addition, individuals who have normal kidney function at the time of hire (n=100), will be monitored using repeat measurements at two additional time points spanning the 6-month sugarcane harvest. At these two time points, dehydration and heat stress, recognized risk factors, will also be measured in the workers. Within- and between-worker variation and magnitude of change will be assessed for selected urinary and blood biomarkers across the harvest. As a result of prior research, the specific nephrotoxic exposures to be evaluated will include non-steroidal anti- inflammatory medication use (diclofenac), tobacco use (cotinine), selected agrochemicals and heavy metals, and Leptospira. Water samples at the worksite will be collected and measured for nephrotoxic agrochemicals and heavy metals at the three collection time points. Results of this research will lead to large-scale intervention trials that will help to prevent CKDu in vulnerable populations, and to the broad dissemination of results internationally."
"9415541","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Conditions such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, developmental abnormalities of the skeleton, as well as malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and breast cancer metastases, all negatively affect the musculoskeletal system. These conditions affect the health of a sizable percentage of the US population and lead to significant disability and substantial health care costs, and there is an ongoing need to better understand their causes and to support the development of more effective and well-tolerated therapies. To address this need, we propose to establish and develop a thematic and multidisciplinary Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). The scientific theme of the CMDR is that molecular and genetic analysis of musculoskeletal diseases, and conditions that involve the skeleton as part of their disease process, will lead to a better understanding of their causes and will support development of novel therapies. Our approach to studying these conditions will take advantage of state-of-the-art approaches to analyze the genome and transcriptome, the genetic manipulation of cells and animals, and skeletal phenotyping. A key to the success of this approach will be to increase the number of investigators whose research is aligned with the scientific theme of the Center via development of junior investigators and recruitment of new and established investigators. We will establish the CMDR on a strong foundation of musculoskeletal research and implement an Organization and Management Plan to create a self-sustaining Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (Aim 1). We will also provide multidisciplinary development and unique research opportunities to young investigators and support them to the point of independence (Aim 2). Lastly, we will create diverse teams of productive investigators by providing access to effective and useful research cores that produce significant and long-lasting benefits to the research infrastructure of UAMS and its affiliated institutions (Aim 3). The Overall Center Organization and Management Plan includes the Administrative Core, three research cores, and four research projects, led by promising junior investigators. The Administrative Core will oversee establishment and operation of the center, the three research cores, and a faculty development plan. The integrated and interactive faculty development plan will include a formal mentoring program that will guide four junior investigators to independence. The CMDR research cores include a Genetic Models Core that will use cutting-edge approaches to genetically manipulate cells and mice, a Bone Histology and Imaging Core that will analyze mouse and human hard tissues, and a Bioinformatics Core that will analyze the large datasets generated by the molecular analyses of cells from mouse and human samples. Successful implementation of this Organization and Management Plan will in the long-term lead to a self-sustaining Center of Biomedical Research Excellence that will generate novel and important results leading to more effective therapies for a variety of conditions that involve the musculoskeletal system."
"9628069","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposal seeks to create and apply new top-down glyco-proteomics procedures that permit unbiased discovery of alterations in protein glycosylation. This includes the creation of algorithms that assemble glycoproteoform networks from multi-dimensional mass spectrometry (MS) datasets, the application of cross-correlation analysis to link glycoproteoform networks with MS spectral information and the creation of an evidence feedback strategy to permit statistical scoring with unique glycoproteoform informatics tools. An innovative aspect of the proposed technologies is that they are intended to permit evaluation of glycoproteins that present with glycosylation at more than one amino acid residue, a well-recognized bottleneck in the top-down field. Our aims also include the application of the top-down algorithms to enable unsupervised discovery of glycoprotein biomarkers in biofluids. We will use these new tools to monitor the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of brain insulin resistance (BIR) rodent models with the intent to discover biomarkers that correlate with development of pathologies or clinical symptoms that are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum disorders. In particular, we seek to establish rodent models to determine if brain metabolic dysfunction early in life contributes to amyloid-beta (A?) peptide deposition in cerebral vasculature and meninges (MG), a common occurrence in dementia patients. A? deposits occur sporadically in the elderly but have a high prevalence in AD and Down syndrome patients. Such deposits are difficult to diagnose without sampling of the brain, and are often not caught until after the occurrence of multiple cerebral hemorrhages and onset of cognitive impairment. Here, we will determine if BIR induces A? deposition in cerebral vasculature and meninges of the rodent models and correlate changes to novel proteins in CSF. These experiments are expected to provide a list of candidate markers for evaluation in CSF human subjects. If our project aims are successful, we will not only have developed innovative new basic science tools for glycoscientists, but also, established innovative clinical proteomics procedures for the discovery and development of glycoprotein-based biomarkers."
"9449855","Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the most common diseases for which people visit a health care provider and receive antibiotics. Recent studies have reported that veterans deployed to the Iraq or Afghan theaters of operation are twice as likely to develop upper respiratory disorders. Veterans of OEF/OIF presenting with post deployment onset of rhinosinusitis undisputedly recount that their symptoms were initiated within several weeks of being deployed supporting an environmental contribution. While bacteria in the sinonasal cavity contribute to the pathophysiology, one puzzle is how microbial species that are more common in people with this disease are also constituents of the normal sinonasal microbiota of healthy people. These phenotypic differences may be due to the inborn genetics of the human host, specifically variation in the taste receptor gene family that are accentuated with exposure to varied environments. Some of these bitter taste receptors, in addition to detecting chemicals on the tongue (taste), also detect secreted bacterial chemicals and trigger the ciliated cells of the sinonasal epithelium to launch an attack. One by-product of this particular physiological system is that people who are not able to taste certain types of bitter compounds may be less able to fight certain bacteria with the same weak sensory signaling pathway. The goal of the proposed research is to combine the expertise of three laboratories to test whether there are interactions between genetic variation of the human host, individual nasal microbiota, and the development of chronic rhinosinusitis: (1) A surgeon scientist with expertise in the medical and surgical treatment of individuals with CRS with access to patients with and without exposure to a foreign environment will ascertain and evaluate the patients. (2) A genomics expert will quantify the human microbiome to the species level using new technologies. (3) A human geneticist and her team will genotype human genomic DNA and evaluate subjects for their ability to taste bitter compounds. The hypothesis is that people with different inborn differences in their ability to detect the chemicals secreted by bacteria will have a different microbiome patterns and susceptibility to CRS. To that end, we will evaluate 60 patients with CRS (cases) and 60 age-, sex, and race-matched healthy controls. This ?bitterome? research could explain, at least in part, how bacterial virulence arises in specific individuals and perhaps lead to simple clinical tests to determine how best to personalize treatment."
"9626748","Summary The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling by endocytic trafficking. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of signaling receptors expressed in the mammalian genome, mediate cellular responses to diverse stimuli and control vast physiological responses. Dysregulated GPCR signaling has been implicated in neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer progression, making this receptor class the target of nearly half the drugs used clinically. In addition to desensitization, GPCR trafficking is crucial for the temporal and spatial control of receptor signaling. This is best exemplified by protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), a GPCR for the coagulant protease thrombin. PAR1 has important functions in vascular physiology and development as well as tumor progression and is an important drug target. Similar to most GPCRs, signaling by activated PAR1 is rapidly desensitized. We also found that activated PAR1 internalization and lysosomal sorting is critical for shutting-off PAR1 signaling. We also discovered that activated PAR1 trafficking is altered in metastatic breast carcinoma and contributes to tumor progression. However, the mechanisms responsible for PAR1 trafficking are not known. Many GPCRs are modified with ubiquitin and sorted to lysosomes through interactions with ubiquitin-binding components of the ESCRT machinery. However, not all GPCRs require ubiquitination for lysosomal sorting including PAR1. We recently discovered a novel lysosomal sorting pathway that bypasses the requirement for ubiquitination and ubiquitin-binding ESCRTs and is mediated ALIX. ALIX, a CHMP4/ESCRT-III interacting protein, bound to YPX3L motif of PAR1 via its V domain to facilitate lysosomal sorting. This pathway may be applicable to a subset of GPCRs containing YPXnL motifs. Our studies further indicate that the ALIX interacting protein arrestin-related protein -3 (ARRDC3) regulates PAR1 degradation. ARRDC3 appears to function as a tumor suppressor and its expression is lost in invasive breast carcinoma that exhibit dysregulated PAR1 trafficking. This proposal is focused on delineating the molecular mechanisms by which ARRDC3 and ALIX regulate GPCR ubiquitin-independent lysosomal sorting and signaling, and the contribution to breast cancer progression. The specific aims of the proposal are to: 1) determine the function of ARRDC3 in GPCR lysosomal sorting, 2) delineate the regulatory mechanisms of ALIX function in lysosomal sorting of GPCRs, and 3) examine the role of ARRDC3 in dysregulated GPCR trafficking in cancer."
"9417049","Project Summary/Abstract In order to meet the complex health care needs of the diverse U.S. population, medical schools must strive to 1) instill in students the values and skills that maximize empathic, patient-centered care, 2) encourage more students to choose careers in primary care, and 3) inspire more students to practice medicine in areas and with populations that are underserved. Despite years of interventions designed to reach these goals, medical schools continue to see declines in students' prosocial attitudes and values during medical school. These attitudes predict the provision of patient-centered care, itself a strong determinant of better patient adherence, utilization, and health outcomes. Furthermore, the U.S. faces a projected shortage of 20,400 primary care physicians by the year 2020, and has an immediate need for 8,200 additional primary care physicians in Healthcare Provider Shortage Areas (HPSAs). These problems each contribute to persistent racial and socioeconomic status disparities in health care access, quality, and outcomes. This study will consist of a secondary data analysis of the CHANGES study (Cognitive Habits and Growth Evaluation), a nationally-representative longitudinal study of medical students' experiences during medical school. We will use these data to develop comprehensive models of change in prosocial attitudes and intentions between matriculation and graduation. Specifically, our aims are to 1) assess the independent impact of medical school climate, curriculum, contact, and student experiences on change in a) empathy, b) attitudes about the importance of empathy, and c) attitudes about the importance of patient-centeredness; 2) assess the independent impact of medical school climate, curriculum, contact, and student experiences on intention to specialize in a primary care field of medicine; and 3) assess the independent impact of medical school climate, curriculum, contact, and student experiences on intention to practice medicine in an HPSA or with underserved populations."

"9417956","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  One billion people will die from tobacco-related illnesses this century. Most health care providers, however, fail to treat tobacco dependence. This may in part be due to the treatment default. Current treatment guidelines recommend that providers a) ask patients if they are willing to quit and b) provide cessation-focused medications and counseling only to smokers who state they are willing to quit. For other health conditions-diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and even substance abuse-the treatment default is to a) identify the health condition and b) initiate evidence-based treatment. For example, when a patient is newly diagnosed with hypertension, they aren't asked if they are `ready' to start treatment. The physician simply begins with a prescription or discussion of treatment options. As with any healthcare treatment option, patients are free to decline-they can opt out if they wish to refuse care. If patients do nothing, they will receive care. For tobacco users, however, the default is that they have to opt in to receive cessation assistance: providers ask smokers if they are willing to quit, and only offer medications and cessation support to those who say yes. This drastically limits the reach of cessation services because, at any given encounter, only 1 in 3 smokers say they are ready to quit. As a result, few receive medications or cessation counseling. Recent studies suggest that, when provided with cessation medications and counseling, unmotivated smokers are as likely to quit as motivated smokers. Hence, there is a critical need to examine the impact of changing the treatment default on utilization and quitting. The objective of this application is to determine the impact of providing all smokers wit tobacco treatment unless they refuse it (OPT OUT) versus current practice-screening for readiness and only offering treatment to smokers who say they are ready to quit (OPT IN). The study employs an individually-randomized design, and is conducted in a tertiary care hospital. We will conduct the trial among 1,000 randomly-selected hospitalized smokers to determine the population impact of changing the treatment default, identify mediators of outcome, and determine the cost-effectiveness of this new, highly proactive approach. This is a population-based study that targets an endpoint of vital interest; applies minimal eligibility criteria to broaden generalizability; and utilizes hospital staff for interventions to ensure long-term sustainability. The study employs an innovative Baysian adaptive design to evaluate a major shift in our approach to care. If effective, this change would expand the reach of tobacco treatment from 30% to 100% of smokers."
"9468697","7. Project Summary/Abstract Tulane University Crist, Angela Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder that affects 1 in 5,000 individuals. Patients with HHT commonly exhibit misconnections between arteries and veins, called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can rupture and lead to stroke or death. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms of AVM formation in HHT are poorly understood therefore no therapy has been developed. Our OBJECTIVE is to identify the molecular mechanism of AVM formation using a novel Smad4 inducible, endothelial cell specific knockout (Smad4-iECKO) mouse model. Our preliminary experiments in the murine retina revealed that loss of Smad4 caused 82% of our mice to develop AVMs. Furthermore, these mice exhibited loss of artery-vein (AV) identity, which we anticipate drives AVM formation. We HYPOTHESIZE that loss of Smad4 leads to AVM formation by directly altering AV identity. Using ChIP-seq, we have confirmed that Smad4 binds to many AV specific genes in a venous EC population. We propose to expand this study to include Smad4 binding sites in an arterial EC population. Using this information, we will identify evolutionarily conserved Smad4 binding regions in both EC populations and determine the biologically relevant sites that control AV gene expression. Furthermore, we will provide a comprehensive characterization of AV gene expression in Smad4 mutants and determine if these changes occur before or after AVM formation. This will allow us to assess if changes in AV identity are a cause or effect of AVM development. Overall, we will provide much needed insight into the role of AV identity in HHT pathogenesis. Furthermore, our studies will undoubtedly provide a better understanding of the TGF-Beta family's role in the endothelium by generating a comprehensive list of Smad4 binding sites in endothelial cells. This knowledge will allow researchers to link the TGF-Beta pathway to its respective target genes and will be relevant to other cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, endocarditis, and cardiomyopathy. !"

We will then test and validate the INTERMAP derived metabolites and pathways using available data and samples from the INTERMAP China Prospective (ICP) Study, the Urinary Sodium Study (USS), and the OmniHeart Trial. The goal is to develop more focused and effective strategies for population- wide BP lowering through improved non-pharmacologic approaches, primarily nutritional, as well as to identify new targets for drug intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to identify urinary metabolites and associated pathways related to Na-BP and DASH/OmniHeart-BP, link these to dietary and other data, and with extensive validation in other cohorts, prospective and trial data."
"9431221","Project Summary  The primary goal of the proposed research is to advance the quality of care provided to people with lower limb amputation (LLA) by developing a state-of-the-art, dynamic measurement system that can be incorporated into clinical practices, research studies, and electronic health record systems. Performance-based measurement of important health outcomes, like prosthetic mobility, is widely acknowledged as an important element of professional practice and a primary contributor to positive patient outcomes. Standardized performance-based measures are well suited to measuring clinical patients, but they are inhibited by a structure that requires a patient to complete a large number of tasks, many of which provide limited value to the clinical assessment. Modern measurement methods, which have been successfully applied to enhancing the quality and efficiency of patient-reported measures, can be extended to address inefficiencies in performance-based testing. In this project, we apply advances in psychometric modelling and computer technology to create a dynamic measurement system that targets the capabilities of each individual patient.  In Aim 1, we will develop a bank of tasks suited to measuring mobility of people with LLA in clinical settings. A large, diverse sample of 500 prosthetic limb users will be recruited in a national cross-sectional study to test candidate tasks. Results will be quantitatively analyzed using item response theory (IRT) to create a calibrated bank of performance tasks that can be targeted to patients with similar characteristics (eg, people with LLA due to diabetes) using fixed-length task sets, or targeted to individual patients using computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In Aim 2, we will conduct statistical simulations to maximize the efficiency of the CAT algorithm. We will use information from patient-report outcome measures to identify the first task and unique stopping rules to ensure patients with very high or very low mobility are not unnecessarily burdened. We will develop an application to allow clinicians and researchers to administer the measure, and software to facilitate integration into electronic health record systems. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the reliability, validity, and efficiency of the developed system for measuring mobility in people with LLA. A diverse sample of 100 prosthetic limb users will be recruited to participate in a repeated-measures study. We will compare results from the developed system to existing measures of mobility, balance, and physical function.  Successful completion of this project will provide a valid, reliable, interpretable, and efficient tool for measuring mobility outcomes in people with LLA and a model for enhancing performance-based measurement in other clinical populations."
"9401926","Abstract Many neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability start early in life and often contribute to a lifetime disability. The rising incidence of these disorders is expected to cause a major public health challenge in the coming decades. Despite the impending challenge, drug development for these disorders is facing a crisis; most major pharmaceutical companies have reduced their investment in psychiatric drug development because of a high failure rate. Limitations associated with animal models and a dearth of druggable biological targets, coupled with poor access to the living human brain for dynamic observation and experimentation all conspire to impose an enormous challenge of finding effective psychiatric drugs. Recent advances in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) have made it possible to create a patient-specific brain-like neural tissue (referred to as `cerebral organoid') that displays an architecture and neural network activity resembling that of human tissue. These cerebral organoids (CO) offer researchers an exciting opportunity to investigate disease mechanisms responsible for the development of neuropsychiatric disorders in humans. We propose in this project to link CO with a tissue-engineered blood vessel (BV) and their blood-brain barrier (BBB) interface to form a cerebral microphysiological system (CMPS). There is documented anatomical parallelism between vessel and nerve patterning and development, and it has also emerged that neuron and vessel specification, growth, navigation, and survival share many molecular pathways. The same signaling pathways also play a critical role in the crosstalk between nerves and vessels during the injury repair process in adult brain. Therefore, it is important to understand the interactions between the CNS and the vascular system under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We propose to use two well-defined genetic lesions, the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS or DiGeorge syndrome) and the Proteus syndrome, that affect both the CNS and vascular systems for the development and validation of CMPS. The proposed CMPS, if successful, will offer a powerful platform to screen neuropsychiatric drugs as well as to develop novel neuropsychiatric treatment strategies that target the shared mechanisms between the CNS and the vascular system. !"
"9415543","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Each of the Project Leaders supported by the proposed Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) will require the generation of new genetically modified mice or cell lines to accomplish the goals of their proposed studies. To serve the needs of this COBRE, a Genetic Models Core will be created by expanding an existing transgenic mouse facility at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). This existing facility has a strong record of producing transgenic mice. However, to meet the needs of the proposed CMDR, it will be necessary to expand its capabilities by adding new technologies and personnel. This will be accomplished in part using recently developed tools that are based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system to provide gene-editing services in both mice and cell lines. This expansion of services will create a Genetic Models Core that, in addition to meeting the needs of the COBRE Project Leaders, will provide new cutting-edge services to the research communities at UAMS, its affiliated institutions, and across Arkansas. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to provide state-of-the-art services for the generation and maintenance of genetically modified mice. Generation services will include the design and creation of transgenic and gene-targeted mice by pronuclear injection. Maintenance services will include sperm cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization, and strain rederivation. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to develop new approaches and services that support genetic model creation and use. New services needed by CMDR members, such as creation of genetically modified cell lines, will be developed. In addition, Core personnel will continuously update gene-editing tools for cell and mouse modification via evaluation of current literature and attendance at workshops and meetings. In Specific Aim 3, we propose to provide training and education related to the use of genetic models. Project Leaders and other users will be trained to efficiently and accurately produce experimental cohorts of genetically modified mice, and we will educate users on potential problems that are often encountered with the use of such models. Core personnel will also educate the research communities at UAMS and other campuses in Arkansas, about the services and technologies available through the Genetic Models Core. The scientific theme of the proposed CMDR is that conditions that lead to deterioration of the skeleton have a molecular basis whose identification will guide development of specific and effective therapies. The Genetic Models Core is consistent with this theme in that it will allow Project Leaders to rapidly and efficiently test the role of specific molecular changes in pathological processes the affect the skeleton or in which the skeleton plays a major role, such as myeloma or breast cancer metastases."
"9445504","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop an improved, minimally-invasive treatment for intracranial aneurysms. Intracranial aneurysms are spherical outpouchings of blood vessels in the head that result from weakness in the vessel wall. Unruptured aneurysms are present in approximately 3% of the general population, and rupture can be devastating with a high morbidity and mortality. In recent years a new type of minimally- invasive endovascular device to treat aneurysms has been introduced to the market. These devices, known as flow diverting stents, are composed of a tubular metal mesh and are placed in the parent artery to cover the neck of the aneurysm being treated. The small pores in the mesh prevent blood from entering the aneurysm, which causes blood trapped inside the aneurysm to become stagnant and clot. The aneurysm then undergoes a process of healing with the stent acting as a scaffold for reconstruction of the parent artery. Despite their success, first-generation flow diverters suffer from a number of limitations such as delayed aneurysm occlusion, often on the order of months, and the need for multiple devices per patient to achieve complete occlusion. In as many as 25% of patients complete occlusion is never achieved. NeuroSigma's next generation flow diverter is based on Thin Film Nitinol (TFN) technology. TFN is an advanced biomaterial fabricated on silicon wafers that overcomes many of the limitations associated with first-generation flow diverters. Results from animal studies suggest that the TFN flow diverter gives superior rates of aneurysm occlusion and faster parent artery repair than first-generation devices. The purpose of this project is to build upon these intriguing findings an develop a rapid occlusion flow diverter, where placement of a single device results in speedy, definitive aneurysm repair. At the completion of this project the TFN flow diverter will be ready t begin first- in-human studies as an improved treatment for the millions who suffer from intracranial aneurysms worldwide."
"9522434","Abstract Systemic characterized production treatment which lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, potentially fatal autoimmune disease by abnormal activation of autoreactive T and B cells resulting in the of autoantibodies that cause widespread tissue and organ damage. Current  strategies rely heavily corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, are limited by suboptimal efficacy and by a significant burden of morbidity. , on Identification of alternative, safer and more comprehensive approaches targeting different elements of disease pathogenesis need to be explored. Our new published and preliminary data support the provocative and intriguing concept that erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced predominantly by the kidney in adults, plays an unanticipated role in controlling autoimmune response in lupus and improving clinical outcomes. Expanding beyond EPO's established role in erythrocyte development, our new data demonstrate that EPO a) improves disease severity in murine models of lupus, b) inhibits mouse and human Th17, T follicular helper cells (TFH), and Th1, while it increases T follicular regulatory cells (Tfr), c) induces and stabilizes Treg, and d) inhibits germinal center B cell formation and autoantibody production. We have identified molecular mechanisms that link EPO to some of these effects and show that they apply to humans given clinically used doses of EPO. EPO therapy, at doses used to correct anemia, augments frequencies of circulating CD4+CD25+CD127lo Treg in human subjects. Altogether, our findings support the following hypothesis to be tested in this project: EPO directly inhibits autoreactive Th17 and TFH, and simultaneously induces and maintains Treg and Tfr, together reducing disease severity in lupus. We will test this hypothesis by determining the effects of exogenous and kidney-derived EPO on murine lupus (aim 1), deciphering the mechanisms through which EPO selectively inhibits Th17 and TFH (aim 2), while EPO promotes Treg/Tfr induction and stability (aim 3). The proposed work will define the role of EPO as a mediator of self- tolerance and will delineate cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying EPO's effects on Th17, TFH, and Treg/Tfr. In addition to deciphering mechanisms, the studies will provide preclinical data on the utility of EPO as a therapeutic agent for improving disease activity in animals, findings that could potentially be translated to SLE patients."
"9448117","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public and VA health concern and exerts substantial burden on as many as 30% (estimates range 14-30%) of veterans returning from deployment in Afghanistan and Iraq from Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). The past two decades of functional neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have implicated brain dysfunction during cognitive processing in PTSD. However, the limitations of PET and fMRI (high cost, labor and skill intensive, not always tolerated, poor portability) make their translation to clinical application in `real world' settings problematic. Therefore, alternative, `proxy' neuroscience approaches that leverage the existing knowledge about brain function gained from fMRI and PET but that are cost-effective and convenient, and that provide data from larger samples in clinical settings are much needed. Electroencephalography (EEG) measures neurophysiology-based event-related potentials (ERP), is a portable, easy-to-use technique that can be deployed in the `real world' office setting and provides time-locked neural activity measures that have excellent test-retest reliability and temporal resolution. ERPs can track quick and transient cognitive demands and emotionally arousing events. Of the cognitive domains, attention/working memory (WM) dysfunction is a consistently observed and robust impairment in combat PTSD. Moreover, WM can be exacerbated by the interference of emotionally arousing trauma-related ?distractors ? together they are thought to be responsible for the everyday concentration and memory difficulties and re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms of PTSD. Work in our lab and others have shown that ERPs such as the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and late positive potential (LPP) are robust neural indices of visual working memory capacity and emotional arousal, and are altered in depression and anxiety disorders. The extent literature and our Preliminary Data compels us to focus on visual working memory because it has high clinical relevance, is impaired in PTSD and related to PTSD severity, and can be quantified with EEG. It is also important to directly compare PTSD against other internalizing psychopathologies (e.g., Major Depressive Disorder, [MDD], in order to make inferences that cognitive and neurophysiological impairments are specific to PTSD. Using an innovative EEG task ? validated in our laboratory - that dynamically integrates working memory and emotional interference with trauma reminders, the current project proposes to address the following Specific Aims/questions: 1) Do combat veterans with PTSD (compared to those without PTSD) have an attenuated contralateral delay activity (CDA) during visual working memory performance? Does CDA magnitude relate specifically to PTSD symptom severity? [Cognition Alone]; 2) Do combat veterans with PTSD (compared to those without PTSD) have an exaggerated late positive potential (LPP) when processing emotionally arousing trauma reminders? Does LPP magnitude specifically relate to PTSD symptom severity? [Emotion Alone]; 3) Does the intrusion of trauma reminders further impair visual working memory performance and further reduce contralateral delay activity in combat veterans with PTSD (and not in veterans without PTSD)? [Emotion on Cognition Interaction]. Comprehensive psychiatric, neuropsychological testing and EEG- ERP imaging will conducted in three groups (N=60 per group) of OEF/OIF/OND combat veterans (PTSD Group, MDD Group, and Control Group) with similar levels of combat trauma exposure. This design allows for both categorical and continuous analyses in order to link brain function with measures of cognitive function specific to PTSD. The overarching objective is to elucidate precise, brain-based markers and targets of PTSD so that we can improve and expand on therapeutic interventions for our veterans."
"9545384","Project Summary/Abstract  Dopamine D1 agonists have shown unique clinical potential for numerous disorders including cognitive deficits (e.g., from psychiatric or neurologic disorders or aging), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson?s disease, and cocaine abuse), and in the few reported clinical studies with experimental D1 agonists, the large effect sizes predicted from preclinical studies have been found. No brain available D1 agonist has yet been approved for clinical use largely because all high intrinsic activity D1 agonists were catechols, and had little oral bioavailability to justify clinical development. Pfizer Inc. has just reported non- catechol D1 agonists entering Phase III, and, although Phase II data are not public, their extensive studies in non-human primates (NHP) have confirmed the findings made with earlier, non-orally available compounds. This suggests that clinical use is on the horizon, raising numerous scientific questions, the most pressing of which is how the interactions of receptor occupancy and intrinsic activity translate into desired pharmacological effects. There are excellent D1 antagonist radioligands for in vivo imaging studies, but these ligands interact equivalently with active (high affinity G protein-coupled) and inactive (low affinity uncoupled) forms of the receptor. For this reason, they have been found to be insensitive to changes in dopamine signaling in vivo. We propose the discovery of a radiolabeled D1 selective agonist ligand that can be used in both laboratory and clinical imaging studies (e.g., SPECT) to quantify high affinity, functional receptors. We have selected a lead template based on excellent predicted pharmacodynamic properties and very accessible chemistry. We will make a precursor molecule that can be rapidly radioiodinated, and then deprotected to yield the candidate radioligand. We shall synthesize the intermediates and non-labeled predicted product, and validate the latter chemically and pharmacologically by its affinity and functional effects at dopamine receptors, and potential binding at off-target binding sites). Confirmation of its D1 agonist properties will be validated both behaviorally and physiologically, and we shall determine if it has metabolites that may affect its use. After the properties of the unlabeled probe have been confirmed, we shall develop and evaluate rapid and efficient radiosynthesis protocols for the candidate ligand. The proposed studies will use 125I, but are amendable to use of 123I (SPECT) or possibly PET (124I). We shall validate ligands by performing dose-response relationships, and compare the measured binding potential ex vivo with administered dose. We then shall select a tracer dose and perform competitive occupancy studies. Because we hypothesize that there are important in vivo differences between agonist and antagonist radioligands, we shall do parallel studies with the selective D1 antagonist [125I]- SCH28392, including autoradiography studies to compare the brain relative densities of high and low affinity sites. Finally, we shall validate the utility of the probe in vivo using functional assays for cognition and motor function."
"9597622","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause debilitating twisting movements and postures. Abnormal dopamine (DA) neurotransmission is consistently observed across many different forms of dystonia, but the DA defects that give rise to dystonia are poorly understood. L-DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) is considered a prototype disorder for understanding how abnormal DA neurotransmission evokes dystonia. DRD is characterized by childhood onset dystonia with diurnal fluctuation whereby symptoms worsen throughout the course of the day. The distinguishing feature of DRD is the dramatic improvement in symptoms after restoration of DA signaling with L-DOPA or DA agonists. Indeed, DRD is caused by mutations in genes critical for DA synthesis, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). DRD-causing TH mutations are associated with some residual TH activity whereas mutations that abolish TH activity cause childhood parkinsonism suggesting that TH activity and [DA] are critical determinants in the development of dystonia. However, the nature of the DA signaling dysfunction that gives rise to dystonia is unknown. To address this gap in our knowledge, we generated a knockin mouse bearing the human DRD-causing Q381K mutation in TH (DRD mice). Like the human disorder, DRD mice display reduced TH activity, a reduction in [DA], dystonic movements that worsen throughout the course of the active period and improvement in the dystonia in response to L-DOPA. Thus, DRD mice exhibit the core neurochemical and symptomatic features of human DRD, thereby providing us with the unprecedented opportunity to dissect the mechanisms underlying DRD from gene to behavior. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the dystonia is mediated by [DA] that is <1% of normal. A similar reduction in presynaptic DA in adults would cause parkinsonism. Therefore, divergent postsynaptic responses likely account for the differences in the neurological consequences of reduced DA transmission between Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia. Indeed, our preliminary data demonstrate D1R supersensitivity, hyperexcitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), a reduction in MSN dendrite number and abnormal corticostriatal innervation. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that early life DA deficiency in combination with (mal)adaptive postsynaptic responses gives rise to dystonia by using a multidisciplinary approach to examine the pre- and postsynaptic consequences of reduced DA transmission associated with dystonia. The Specific Aims are: 1. To elucidate the relationship between monoamine metabolism and the severity of dystonia. 2. To determine the DA receptor subtype(s) and signaling defects that contribute to the dystonia. 3. To delineate alterations in th intrinsic and synaptic properties of D1 and D2R-expressing MSNs. 4. To examine the dendritic morphology and ultrastructural changes in corticostriatal synapses onto D1R and D2R-expressing MSNs in response to early-life DA deprivation in DRD mice."
"9418594","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been established that proteins (and thus, their peptide products) are ribosomally translated using only L-amino acids, and so it was assumed that D-amino acids did not naturally exist in animal peptides. However, physiological D-amino containing-peptides (DAACP) do exist, first identified in frogs, resulting from a post-translationa modification: peptide isomerization. However, because they have no associated mass shift, DAACPs are historically very difficult to identify, causing a gap in mass spectrometry-driven peptide characterization studies. The objective of the proposed work aims to bridge this gap by developing tools to detect DAACPs by taking advantage of their unique properties, including their resistance to degradation by peptidases. In addition, formation of a DAACP alters the shape of a peptide, which can change its ability to bind to a receptor. This is especially important for neuropeptides, cell-cell signaling molecules that are bioactive by binding to their cognate receptor. Thus, in specific aim 1, the tools to identify DAACPs will be developed using neuropeptides from a simpler model animal, where one DAACP has already been identified. This system of DAACP discovery involves chiral analysis: breaking down an endogenous neuropeptide into its component amino acids and assaying those amino acids for their chirality using analytical chemistry methods. The long-term objective of this work is to identify functional DAACPs in the mammalian nervous system. As part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) program areas, it is interested in the function of neurotransmitters (like neuropeptides) in endogenous systems. In spite of intensive study, more than 100 human G-protein coupled receptors have no known binding partner. DAACPs may explain, in part, the discrepancy between the number of neuropeptides known through genomic and peptidomic studies and the large number of orphan receptors. For the proposed work, in specific aim 2, neuropeptides will be studied for peptide isomerization in the context of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a hypothalamic group of neurons with a known role in circadian rhythms. The SCN is targeted because there are extensive studies on time of day release of neuropeptides and a number of peptidase-resistant peptides have already been identified in the SCN. This work is significant because NIDA has identified sleep disorders as having a link to drug abuse, so the implication of an overlooked PTM can result in many missed neuropeptide functions in our sleep/wake cycles. The discovery of DAACPs as a physiological phenomenon in mammalian neuropeptides ultimately helps reach the goal of understanding drug abuse by identifying the functional properties of neural circuits underlying drug abuse."
"9469519","Project Summary  Traditional treatments for bone injuries have significant limitations. While over one million allogenic and  autologous bone grafting procedures are performed each year, significant incidences of medical complications  - often involving modest viability, poor integration, or an immune response - still occur. Therefore, the flexibility  provided by an in vitro cultured, engineered tissue provides an excellent avenue to repair and replace  damaged bone tissue. This approach involves seeding and growing a cell source on a scaffold and implanting  the cell-laden construct into the injury site. However, the culture of large volume engineered tissues - and  particularly cell viability, expansion, proliferation, and differentiation in these large tissues - is limited by current  culture techniques. To address this concern, TR&D1 aims to develop a 3D printed (3DP) bioreactor as a  dynamic culture system to control cellular microenvironment and therefore promote cell viability, expansion,  proliferation, and differentiation within large engineered constructs. To this end, we have recently developed a  tubular perfusion system (TPS) bioreactor that enables the expansion of human mesenchymal stem cells, the  differentiation of these cells into osteoblasts, and the subsequent formation of boney tissue. Based on our  earlier TPS bioreactor, we will use 3D printing to fabricate specialized bioreactor chambers with variable  architecture, controlled flow environments, and spatially located cell populations; thus, we can ensure  adequate availability of nutrients and oxygen for the expansion of stem cells within these large constructs.  Furthermore, 3D printing control of the spatial location of cell populations will allow us to determine interactions  between multiple cell populations, such as mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. Finally, we will utilize  the strategies developed in the in vitro 3D bioreactor chambers to fabricate removable, biodegradable scaffolds  of engineered bone tissues that are suitable for in vivo application. The results of these studies will deliver a  3DP bioreactor system that can support the growth of large engineered tissues, while also providing a set of  tools to develop other, similarly designed, tissue specific bioreactor systems."
"9626049","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanisms by which protein ubiquitination regulates cellular resistance to oxidative stress. Increased exposure to oxidants combined to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates is the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Oxidative stress is a very prominent type of stress induced by exposure to diverse environmental factors such as ionizing radiation, heat, and pollutants. Oxidative stress damages several biomolecules including lipids, DNA and proteins, potentially resulting in cell death. To prevent cell death and disease progression, cells use ubiquitination as the signal for removing damaged proteins through the proteasome and thus preventing aggregation. However, many non-degradative roles for ubiquitination have been described which are signaled by different lysine (K) ubiquitin chains when conjugated to target proteins. Using yeast S. cerevisiae as a model, we found that the unconventional K63 polyubiquitin chain accumulates strongly and dynamically, and impacts cellular viability in response to oxidative stress. Using innovative proteomics approaches, we identified many ribosome proteins as targets of K63 ubiquitination. However, the mechanisms by which K63 ubiquitination regulates cellular viability are still unknown. Therefore, in Aim1 system-wide approaches will be employed to investigate how K63 ubiquitination affects protein expression (K99). In Aim 2, interaction analysis will be performed to define the mechanisms that regulate the specificity of the K63 ubiquitin pathway in response to oxidative stress (K99/R00). Further, it has been demonstrated that mammalian cells accumulate K63 ubiquitin in response to oxidative stress, but the evolutionary conservation of this redox pathway is completely unknown. In Aim 3, the redox K63 ubiquitin system will be taken to mammalian cells to investigate overall conservation by mapping this pathway to the stress response in neuronal cells (R00). The outcome of this project will unravel novel mechanisms to increase cell tolerance to stress depending on selective ubiquitination. My entire career focused on studying different regulatory aspects of the ubiquitin proteasome system in response to stress. During the K99 mentored phase of this award, I will obtain training in genomics and computational techniques that will enable the investigation of one more layer of cellular signaling mediated by ubiquitin. NYU offers an ideal combination of intellectual environment and multidisciplinary facilities for th development of the K99 phase of this project. My long-term career goal is to establish my independent research group that will combine systems-wide methodologies with molecular biology and genetic approaches to decode the ubiquitination signals in response to stress. This award offers a unique opportunity to achieve this goal by enabling precise training and career guidance from my mentors and committee for my transition to independence. Understanding the multiple ubiquitin roles in cellular response to stress and the specificity of each distinct pathwa will provide groundbreaking insights into innovative strategies for treatment and early diagnosis of many damage-related disorders."
"9591191","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian female reproductive tract, including the oviducts, uterus, and vagina, is essential for the generation of progeny and a frequent site of human disease, including infertility and cancer. The female reproductive tract is derived from the M?llerian ducts of the fetus, a pair of epithelial tubes with a surrounding mesenchyme. In mammals, two pairs of genital ducts form within the mesonephroi associated with the fetal gonads regardless of sex genotype. Initially, the Wolffian ducts form that subsequently give rise to the vas deferentia, epididymides, and seminal vesicles in males. The Wolffian ducts then guide the formation of the M?llerian ducts. The cell behaviors that regulate the elongation of the M?llerian duct are poorly understood. We will use fluorescent, time-lapse imaging of the mesonephros to determine the cell behaviors and mechanisms that lead to M?llerian duct elongation. We have shown that deletion of Lhx1, that encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, in the M?llerian duct leads to ductal loss and subsequently uterine aplasia. In the absence of the M?llerian duct the epithelial compartment, the stroma and inner myometrial layer of the uterus does not differentiate. However, the outer myometrium does form. These results highlight the intrinsic and extrinsic roles of the M?llerian duct for female reproductive tract differentiation. Emx2 and Pax2, encode transcription factors that are also expressed in the M?llerian duct and may participate in a genetic pathway of uterine development. We will test their roles in uterine development by performing M?llerian duct-specific knockouts. In males, the fetal testes produce the TGF-beta family member anti-M?llerian hormone (AMH) that binds receptors expressed in the M?llerian duct mesenchyme, causing the elimination of the M?llerian ducts. The fetal ovaries do not produce AMH, permitting M?llerian duct differentiation. Thus, mammalian fetuses are initially ambi-sexual with the potential to develop both male and female reproductive tract organs. Defects in the formation of the genital ducts and resolution of the ambi-sexual state to a male or female phenotype lead to disorders of sexual development (DSD). We have preliminary RNA-seq data that has identified candidate genes expressed in male M?llerian duct mesenchyme but not in females that may mediate AMH-induced M?llerian duct regression. The in vivo role of a subset of these candidate genes (Msx-Dlx-Osterix) will be tested by M?llerian duct mesenchyme-specific knockout. The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular, cellular, and developmental mechanisms that regulate female reproductive tract organogenesis and M?llerian duct regression during male differentiation."
"9469049","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy is a mainstay for induction and maintenance of remission in moderate- to-severe Crohn?s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), but is not effective for many, leading to protracted morbidity, hospitalizations, and surgery. Up to thirty percent of patients demonstrate no response to anti-TNF induction therapy (primary non-response), and an additional 10-15% lose response annually. With the emergence of novel therapeutics with different mechanisms of action, a priori prediction of response to a particular therapeutic class before exposure to therapy is increasingly important. Such a targeted approach will benefit the patient by avoiding unnecessary exposure to ineffective therapies and allowing attainment of earlier remission through initial selection of the therapy most likely to benefit. Importantly, it may also benefit society from a cost-effectiveness standpoint by reducing costs related to ineffective therapies and healthcare utilization. To date, clinical predictors of response to anti-TNF therapy have not been widely replicated and do not provide a reliable model for use in clinical practice. Our central hypothesis is that genetic polymorphisms related to inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis or the mechanisms of action of anti-TNF agents may influence response to these drugs, and that use of these polymorphisms to predict response to anti-TNF therapy will provide a precision medicine approach for improved quality and cost-effective care in the clinical setting. Our group has recently established the ability to use a genetic risk score to predict response to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn?s disease, and has demonstrated superiority of this model to one including only clinical variables for primary anti-TNF non-response. Whether a similar approach is also beneficial in ulcerative colitis is unknown, but is important to establish given different disease-related loci, disease phenotype, and likelihood of response. We plan to investigate our hypothesis through three specific aims. First, we will define the association of genetic polymorphisms with primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis using a large rigorously-phenotyped cohort and validate this in an external independent cohort. We will test these polymorphisms in a predictive model for anti-TNF non-response. In our second aim, we will define the role of genetics in determining durable response to therapy, with particular focus on their impact on drug pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. Finally, we will develop a cost-effectiveness model examining the utility of our precision medicine genotype-driven therapeutic algorithm compared to an unselective approach with respect to costs, clinical outcomes, and quality of life. We will determine the necessary predictive value threshold of this personalized approach to achieve cost-effectiveness on a societal scale. The long-term goal of this work is to understand and utilize human biology in inflammatory bowel disease to create a personalized, precise approach to therapy to improve outcomes and quality of life."
"9481510","Abstract: Opportunistic infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality of AIDS patients in developing countries and AIDS patients are susceptible to a number of cancers caused by opportunistic infections. Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is the most common tumor of AIDS patients and is the most commonly reported tumor overall in parts of Africa. The etiologic agent of KS is Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV-8). KSHV is invariably found in the main KS tumor cell, the spindle cell, a cell of endothelial origin, where the virus is present predominantly in the latent state. Spindle cells express markers of lymphatic endothelial cells and appear to be most closely aligned with this endothelial cells type. While KSHV is clearly an oncogenic virus, little is known about the early steps of how KSHV infection of endothelial cells leads to tumors. It is generally recognized that one of the early steps of tumor formation is immortalization of cells. There are two main steps in immortalization of human cells, senescence and crisis. While there have been studies that have examined KSHV Induced immortalization and transformation, no clear tractable and reliable relevant human cell system has be identified. We recently found that KSHV infection of primary neonatal lymphatic endothelial cells leads to bypass of senescence, the first step in immortalization. This proposal will further analyze the KSHV mediated bypass of senescence and determine if KSHV can drive full immortalization or if other genetic steps are necessary. Both the cellular and viral mechanism of KSHV mediated immortalization of lymphatic endothelial cells will also be elucidated. These studies provide a robust system for analyzing KSHV mediated immortalization of the cell type most closely related to the main KS tumor cell, the spindle cell. A deeper understanding of how KSHV induces the earliest steps in immortalization will help identify how KSHV alters endothelial cells to become spindle cells and ultimately KS tumors and potentially provides novel therapeutic avenues for KS cell proliferation."
"9413196","PROJECT SUMMARY  Vascular stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in diabetes and represents an  understudied, but potentially modifiable risk factor for death in the large and growing population of American  diabetics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic vascular stiffness are only recently coming  to light, and therapeutic targets remain elusive.    The apelin-­APJ signaling axis is a potentially targetable molecular pathway that is dysregulated in  diabetes and activation of which is associated with decreased vascular stiffness in humans and mice.  Importantly, preliminary data in apelin knockout mice suggests that this decreased stiffness may occur in part  through decreased vascular medial fibrosis. MicroRNA-­29b (MiR-­29b) protects against medial fibrosis by  translational repression of collagen and elastin transcripts, and its expression is regulated by canonical second  messengers of apelin-­APJ binding. Therefore, we hypothesize that diabetes decreases apelin/APJ  signaling, leading to a miR-­29b ?dependent alteration in collagen and elastin expression in the  vascular media to cause increased vascular stiffness.    In Specific Aim1, I will use cultured vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to apelin and hyperglycemia  as well as specific inhibitors of canonical APJ signaling to elucidate the specific molecular mechanisms by  which apelin increases miR-­29b expression in the vascular media.  In Specific Aim 2, I will use a mouse model of diabetes, the leptin knockout (db/db) mouse as well as  apelin knockout mice to assess the effect of in vivo modulation of miR-­29b expression and apelin on diabetic  vascular stiffness as measured by ex vivo pressure myography. Specifically, I expect to demonstrate that miR-­ 29b administration to apelin KO mice rescues their increase in vascular stiffness, and that in db/db mice, apelin  administration rescues vascular stiffness in a miR-­29b-­dependent manner.     In Specific Aim 3, I will examine the regulation of these molecular actors in human diabetes by  measuring aortic expression of apelin, APJ, miR-­29b and markers of vascular medial fibrosis in diabetic vs  non-­diabetic patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. This will confirm that the apelin-­ APJ-­miR-­29b pathway is downregulated in human diabetes, making it a viable therapeutic target to reduce  diabetic vascular stiffness.  The proposed experiments will identify multiple putative therapeutic targets and provide a scaffold on  which to study multiple molecular pathways converging on vascular stiffness. As this represents one of the few  targetable disease entities in which intervention can prevent mortality and improve symptoms, this project has  the potential to contribute greatly to our treatment of diabetic cardiovascular disease.   "
"9528055","PROJECT ABSTRACT Epilepsy surgery involving the anteromedial temporal lobe (ATL) often results in deficits of language or memory. The best clinical predictor of postsurgical cognitive deficits is the extent to which tissues around the epileptogenic focus were spared during resection. We recently showed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) can predict normative variance in higher-order cognition; rs-FC has subsequently been shown to outperform lesion-based analyses for modeling stroke-related deficits of higher-order cognitions including memory. The proposed retrospective analyses of existing datasets will evaluate the prognostic value of rs-FC for modeling presurgical deficits of language and memory among patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 1 will replicate our methodology for relating rs-FC to cognitive ability using an independent normative sample of healthy control subjects acquired at Emory University. Aim 2 will evaluate the clinical utility of our method by modeling the influence of clinical symptoms (such as seizure frequency and laterality of epileptogenic focus) upon the relationship between rs-FC and presurgical memory and/or language deficits within a sample of patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 3 will use machine learning approaches to evaluate rs-FC's ability to explain presurgical cognitive deficits relative to other MRI modalities (such as anatomic volume, cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and task-based fMRI activity). The proposed model-based and hypothesis- driven research plan would critically evaluate resting-state fMRI's prognostic capability to explain epilepsy- related cognitive deficits, and thus establish the necessary methodological groundwork for future prospective analyses using rs-FC to predict postsurgical cognitive outcomes."
"9445335","Schizophrenia is a serious and debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects nearly 1% of the world's population. Within the Veterans Health Administration, total costs in FY 2014 for Veterans with psychotic disorders (of which schizophrenia is the most severe) was over 6 billion dollars. Deficits in cognition ? both non-social and social -- are core features of schizophrenia. The deficits in social cognition refer to the processes that are involved in the perception, encoding, storage, retrieval and regulation of information about other people and ourselves. The problems in social cognition underlie the social disability and reduced functioning of the illness. A greater understanding of social cognitive impairments would provide opportunities for targeted recovery- focused interventions. This proposal will address an unanswered question: specifically how and where in the brain social processing goes awry in schizophrenia. We know which social processing brain systems are relevant to understanding schizophrenia. However, we do not know whether social processing impairments emerge within a particular brain system or between systems when they work together (i.e., are integrated). Only some systems are impaired in schizophrenia. For example, mentalizing, which involves taking others' viewpoints, is clearly impaired in schizophrenia. Affect sharing, which is the automatic activation of emotion in ourselves when we see emotional displays in others, is relatively intact. Empathy (i.e. sharing, understanding, and responding to emotional experiences of another person) is a high-level social processing ability that requires integration among processing systems, including affect sharing and mentalizing. Our knowledge of the neural basis of social processing impairments and social disability in schizophrenia is severely lacking, and the goal of this proposal is to address this knowledge gap. The study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine regional brain activity, seed- based connectivity, and brain network organization in 72 Veterans with schizophrenia and 72 group-matched controls. Clinical assessments and performance-based tasks in social cognition will also be included. The aims will be addressed using three social processing paradigms: 1) A Pain Rating Task in which participants view painful and non-painful images. It activates the affect sharing system. 2) A Director's Task in which participants take the same or different viewing perspective as another person. It activates the mentalizing system. And 3) An Empathic Accuracy Task in which participants monitor the mood of a social ?target? on a video. It relies on multiple social processing systems, including affect sharing and mentalizing. A close evaluation of activation, connectivity, and brain network organization in social processing brain systems will identify specific points of neural vulnerability in schizophrenia. In that way, we can begin to understand how specific disruptions in neural processes lead to impaired social functioning."
"9440510","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Climate change will lead to more intense and longer-lasting extreme weather events, such as floods, hurricanes, and severe storms, which will lead to more frequent power outage (PO). Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of PO on human health: most previous studies were based on self-reported survey data, which is subject to reporting bias. In addition to weather factors that directly affect human health, other concurrent factors such as PO may also mediate with extreme weather on health, for which research is also lacking. Few studies assessed both power infrastructures and population vulnerabilities, and compared the effects of different PO causes. Furthermore, no health prediction models have been developed for PO. To fill these knowledge gaps, the proposed study will build upon multiple ongoing/ completed studies to: 1) assess the effects and mediating pathways of PO on electricity-dependent health outcomes, co-morbidities, and nursing home transfers; 2) identify infrastructure, environmental, and population vulnerabilities (individual and community); and 3) develop a vulnerability index and prediction model. We will effectively link the accessible New York statewide hospital admission and emergency department (ED) visit data with the existing data on PO, weather, air pollution, census, and nursing home transfer data. The associations between PO causes, frequency, duration, or area coverage of PO and electricity-dependent hospitalizations or ED visits due to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning will be assessed through Bayesian spatial-temporal model. This advanced technique will be able to control for both socio-demographic differences by regions and multiple temporal variables simultaneously. To improve scientific rigor, we will use control days (without PO and extreme weather) to separate PO from weather effects, and control diseases (e.g. appendicitis) to examine temporal changes of disease reporting. To understand PO?s natural direct and indirect effects, causal mediation analysis will be used. Furthermore, new variable selection methods, including Sure Independence Screening and Generalized Additive Model Selection will be used to screen and select predictors highly associated with outcomes. A composite vulnerability index weighed by risk factors identified and vulnerability maps will be developed. We will establish PO and PO-related health predictive models using the state-of-the-art data mining techniques, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, and Ensemble Learning Decision Tree model. The excellent team with multidisciplinary and experienced investigators, numerous already collected and geocoded datasets, innovative data mining and analysis methods, continuation of student training, and successful prior partnerships with government agencies will maximize the probability of our success and feasibility. This project will also significantly enhance our institute?s environment and students? involvement in research, and our findings will identify evidence-based strategies for emergency management and public health preparedness."
"9415542","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this application is to establish a thematic, multidisciplinary Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) via the COBRE mechanism. This will be a self-sustaining research center focused on identifying the molecular causes of diseases and conditions that negatively impact the musculoskeletal system or interact with this system as part of their disease process. Successfully establishing this COBRE will spur the development of new and effective therapies for a broad range of conditions, including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, aberrant skeletal development, osteomyelitis, multiple myeloma, and cancer metastases to the bone. A key to the success of this Center will be the development of new independent investigators who are committed to team-based musculoskeletal research. To develop and operate this Center, the Administrative Core will establish the scientific and administrative infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of musculoskeletal researchers at UAMS and affiliated institutions and will oversee all organizational and budgetary aspects of Center development and function (Specific Aim 1). The Administrative Core will also implement a faculty development plan that will mentor four junior investigators to the point of independence, as measured by obtaining R01-level funding, and beyond (Specific Aim 2). The Administrative Core will support the growth of the Center by recruiting and promoting the development of new junior investigators to replace those that achieve independence via a pilot project program, the targeted recruitment of new investigators, and by effective Center evaluation (Specific Aim 3). These goals will be accomplished under the leadership of the Center Director who, with the support of experienced mentors and an Internal and External Advisory Committee, will guide four Project Leaders focused on musculoskeletal research to independence. The Administrative Core will also oversee the operation of three Research Cores providing state-of-the-art services to create new genetic models (Core B), perform specialized skeletal tissue analysis (Core C), and perform bioinformatic analyses of large molecular datasets (Core D). The overall success of this strategy will be gauged by achieving the following milestones within the first five years of Center funding: 1) three or more of the Project Leaders will successfully compete for NIH or federal R01-level research grant support to graduate to independent investigator status; 2) two to four new Project Leaders (and Mentors) will be selected and join the Center; 3) Project Leaders and other Center members will publish between 20 and 30 peer-reviewed publications; and 4) graduated Project Leaders and other members of the Center will be in the process of developing, or will have submitted, a center-level grant application, such as a P01 or P30."
"9543720","ABSTRACT Antimicrobials (including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals) are among the most commonly prescribed medications in all healthcare settings. Unlike most therapeutic agents, their use can contribute to their own future ineffectiveness. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria now cause ~ 23,000 deaths annually in the US. Worldwide it is estimated by 2050, 10 million deaths annually will be attributable to antimicrobial resistance unless we improve our use of these life-saving drugs. A key strategy in combating antimicrobial resistance is performing antimicrobial stewardship. Antimicrobial stewardship assures that the correct antimicrobial is prescribed and administered at the correct time, with the correct dose, and for the correct duration. This practice will mitigate the selective pressure driving antimicrobial resistance, reduce antimicrobial adverse drug reactions, and promote better clinical outcomes. The Annual International Pediatric Antimicrobial Stewardship Conference has been dedicated to implementing and improving antimicrobial stewardship for children cared for in all healthcare settings for the past 8 years. As the only conference in the world dedicated to pediatric antimicrobial stewardship, the conference has seen an increase in attendance as these topics have come to the forefront of medical and pharmacy practice. The conference is intended for all healthcare professionals and includes a basic workshop for those individuals just learning and starting antimicrobial stewardship programs in both inpatient and outpatient settings. National experts present new research and best practice in the areas of implementation, treatment strategies for antibiotic-resistant infections, epidemiology of resistance, the influence of antimicrobials on the microbiome, and social determinants of antimicrobial prescribing. Importantly, the meeting attracts many trainees, who have the opportunity to present their research in oral and poster form and to interact and collaborate with national experts in the field. Most importantly, the conference is structured to encourage and facilitate networking and establishment of collaborations that will prove essential in the fight against antibiotic-resistant infections."
"9415548","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that is located in the bone marrow (BM) and remains fatal for the majority of patients. Despite an increasing knowledge about the underlying tumor biology of MM, the mechanisms leading to relapse and finally to treatment failure have not been sufficiently identified. One possible explanation could be that previous studies were based almost exclusively on tumor specimens randomly collected from a single site of the skeleton, usually the iliac crest of the pelvis. Imaging studies, however, have shown MM to be a heterogeneously distributed disease with the majority of patients presenting with nodular accumulations of malignant plasma cells scattered throughout the bone marrow containing skeletal system ? so called focal lesions (FLs). Notably, the number of FLs represents an independent, negative prognostic marker for disease outcome. Furthermore, our own sequencing and expression data have revealed an accumulation of poor prognosis mutations in these regions and tumor growth-promoting conditions, which suggests that FLs are hotspots of tumor evolution. Despite their prognostic role, FLs are poorly understood and their cellular and extracellular composition and the interplay between these components remain uncharacterized. The central hypothesis of the proposed work is that specific tumor?microenvironmental (ME) interactions within FLs foster MM evolution, which finally leads to high-risk transformation and, subsequently, to relapse and treatment failure. To address this hypothesis, we will investigate the genotypic and phenotypic states of tumor and ME cells in FLs by single-cell RNA sequencing (Aim 1). BM specimens from non-FL sites from the same patient will be utilized as a control. The analysis of the proliferation and senescence state, variation in oncogenic signaling pathways, and various programs resulting in the exhaustion of T cells will unravel the specific features of FLs compared to other BM sites. Furthermore, we will perform a spatial-temporal DNA sequencing study of specimens from FLs and other sites of the skeletal system to determine the impact of anti-MM treatment on the spatial clonal architecture and the evolutionary history of selected clones (Aim 2). This will elucidate tumor-intrinsic mutational drivers and the mechanisms leading to drug-resistance and high-risk disease. To determine the functional consequences of key findings from this work, we will use our in-house SCID-rab model, a sophisticated murine model that allows for growth of MM cells in implanted rabbit bones (Aim 3). As a first step in these studies, will introduce an activating mutation into the STAT3 gene in the IL-6-dependent MM cell line INA-6 and introduce it into the SCID-rab model. This will reveal whether this variant leads to BM independency of the cell line and facilitates growth as FLs and/or at sites outside the BM. Successful completion of these studies will provide a mechanistic explanation for the prognostic value of the number of FLs. This will allow for the development of more effective therapies and finally lead to the cure of MM, which is the long-standing goal of this work.  "
"9134490","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare: Decision support, surveillance, and quality care initiatives have incredible potential to increase the health of veterans. The rich clinical data contained in the electronic health record enables development of these applications; however, much of that data is locked in free-text reports and remains inaccessible to computerized applications. Natural language processing (NLP) can be applied to provide structured output from free-text input. The VA has been at the forefront of developing NLP techniques within the VHA.  Background: A new generation of tools is needed to realize the vision of effective use and analysis of free-text clinical records for both improving care quality and informing clinical research. Clinical natural language  processing tools have been developed for classifying, extracting, and summarizing information from narrative  clinical texts, in support of diverse tasks  including the identification of patients with nosocomial infections,  phenotype-genotype correlation, and selection of patient cohorts for research studies. The VA has been a leader in developing NLP capability, with the hope of implementing NLP in system-facing, patient-facing, and team-facing applications being developed in hi2 HMP and iEHR. Many NLP tools and components are already being developed and hosted on Veteran's Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) (Project 1).  Unfortunately, a large gap between development and clinical/research practice limits applicability-most  applications require customization of NLP tools to specific domains, NLP tasks often require the combination of  multiple (often incompatible) tools, and there is a need to integrate external displays to aid interpretation.  Advances in human-computer interaction and information visualization suggest approaches that can help overcome many of these limitations. A growing body of experience with interactive visualizations of clinical data provides multiple models of how abstracted information from clinical records might best be displayed to users, while extensive experience in fields such as end-user programming and user-centered design provides guidance on how some of the shortcomings in clinical NLP application might be addressed.  Objective: We envision a flexible, user-centered development environment that will provide VA clinicians and medical researchers with the ability to customize and configure NLP and visualization components with little or no NLP-specific expertise or custom software development. As shown in Figure 1, we will build upon a solid  foundation of successful VA NLP components (Project 1) developed largely by members of this CREATE team  to realize this goal, applying user-centered design and evaluation techniques to address the gap between  existing NLP technology and the needs of end users (providers and researchers in projects 3 and 4). The resulting development environment will allow non-NLP experts to customize, investigate, and apply NLP to clinical tasks and to develop visual interfaces that integrate and display EHR data.  Methods: Consistent with the entire INFORMED CREATE, our approach is a user-centered approach in which the data needs of users are considered in the context of their clinical workflow. Users for this project are researchers and providers in Projects 3 and 4 seeking to develop applications for extracting, analyzing, and displaying structured and unstructured data from the EHR. The development environment will be a general-purpose toolkit for researchers developing diverse types of displays for many different domains."
"9438718","Abstract In the United States, hypertension (HTN) is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a more significant problem among Black women. About 46.1% of Black women over the age of 20 have HTN compared to White (30.1%) and Hispanic (29.9%) women. Currently, the prevalence of HTN in Black women is highest in the United States and is expected to increase underscoring the relatively ineffective prevention and management efforts for blood pressure (BP) control. Blacks tend to develop HTN earlier in life with greater severity and more organ damage when compared to Whites and uncontrolled HTN increases the risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, stoke, and kidney disease. Black females experience a substantially higher death rate from HTN at 2.1 times the rate of both White and Hispanic females. Poor execution of evidence-based HTN guidelines and clinical inertia among healthcare providers along with patient nonadherence to prescribed treatment contribute to poor BP control. It is well known that antihypertensive medications along with lifestyle modifications have proven efficacy in lowering BP when adhered to consistently. However, for Blacks, the lingering effects of their historical legacy, continued segregated communities, high poverty rates, and unequal medical treatment, place them in a unique position to view healthcare with skepticism that differs from all other racial/ethnic groups. Thus, accepted approaches to HTN management have not been optimally effective in producing sustained BP control for Black women. Since nonadherence occurs in the context of everyday living, strategies are needed that encourage more active individual engagement in health care behaviors and self- care activities, in the physical and social environment where they can be performed by patients independently. The objective of this NHLBI K01 Mentored Career Development Award is to obtain research training and develop the skills needed to be an independent investigator, and to use those skills to test the effectiveness of an established Chronic Disease Self-management Program (CDSMP) plus an innovative interactive technology-enhanced coaching (ITEC) system, on improving BP control in community-dwelling Black women with uncontrolled HTN. The proposed project is a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), repeated measures design, with specific aims to determine whether the effects of CDSMP combined with ITEC will maintain BP control, attain medication adherence, and achieve lifestyle modifications (medication adherence, physical activity, diet, and weight management) compared to the CDSMP alone. We hypothesize that participants who receive self-care management and interactive coaching with technology will have lower systolic/diastolic BP and better adherence to antihypertensive medication(s) and lifestyle recommendations post intervention compared to participants receiving self-care management alone. The expected outcome of this study will provide preliminary evidence to inform the design of a fully powered RCT for an R01 application before the end of the K Award."
"9467399","Project Summary This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project aims to develop and characterize a sensor-based platform to track and analyze healthcare providers? hand hygiene quality and compliance automatically and continuously. Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) are the most common type of complication for patients who are hospitalized. In the United States, 1 out of every 20 hospitalized patients is affected by healthcare-associated infections. A good hand hygiene practice is one of the most effective measures to reduce transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to patients. However, recent data shows that on average U.S. healthcare providers clean their hands less than half of the times they should. Today most hospitals still rely on direct observation to monitor healthcare providers? hand hygiene compliance, which is very ineffective, expensive, time consuming and often results in biased data. Therefore, the development of a fully automated and easy-to-use platform to continuously monitor the healthcare providers? hand hygiene compliance can have significant impact on clinical management. In this research proposal, we will develop, prototype and test a low-power hand hygiene sensor and develop the analytics software for hand hygiene compliance monitoring. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a sensor-based platform to help healthcare providers improve their hand hygiene practices and reduce healthcare associated infections."

"9572702","Project Summary Age-related arterial dysfunction is the main risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Recently, we have used short-term and lifelong studies in mice to determine how a Western-style diet (WD; high fat and sugar, low fiber and nutrient density) and aerobic exercise (EX), common lifestyle factors, interact with aging to influence endothelial dysfunction and stiffening of the large elastic arteries. We found that WD accelerates, and EX prevents, these key features of arterial aging via changes in oxidative stress and inflammation. The gut microbiome is a strong modulator of host metabolic health and inflammation that is influenced by age, diet and EX, but there is no information about its effects on arterial function in these or other settings. Our integrative hypothesis is that dysregulation of the gut microbiome (gut dysbiosis) with primary aging and WD consumption, coupled with increased intestinal permeability that allows gut-derived particles to leak into circulation, may act to impair arterial function via changes to adverse gut-derived metabolites such as atherosclerosis-linked trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), and stimulation of toll-like receptor 4-induced pro- inflammatory signaling, whereas chronic aerobic exercise protects against these effects. The purpose of this application is to determine the potential causal role of the gut microbiome in the effects of aging, WD and EX on arterial function, and gain insight into the underlying metabolomic and inflammatory mechanisms. We will employ 3 highly innovative, complementary translational approaches: 1. Mouse studies that allow us to discern cause-and-effect: a) by assessing arterial function with aging ± WD in the presence vs. absence of the gut microbiome and associated signaling; and b) by determining if vascular phenotypes associated with aging, WD and EX can be transferred via the gut microbiome. We also will explore possible mechanisms using pharmacological inhibition and/or knock-out of suspected pathways. 2. Human studies assessing the time course (temporal associations) of diet (WD vs. non-WD)-induced changes in the gut microbiome vs. arterial function in young and older exercising and non-exercising healthy adults, using a randomized, single-blind, controlled feeding crossover study design. 3. Combined mouse/human studies employing ?humanized? mice to determine if the characteristics present in the human gut microbiome with age, WD and EX predictably influence arterial function. These studies will determine not only changes to gut microbe presence and relative abundance with aging, WD and EX, but also the functional effects of those changes, allowing us to gain novel insight into the role of the gut microbiome in modulating vascular function with aging and these common lifestyle influences. The expected results have the potential to establish the gut microbiome as a key mechanism and therapeutic target for age-related arterial dysfunction, and to identify lifestyle or pharmacological strategies that may preserve microbial health, enhance arterial function and reduce the risk of age-related CVD."
"9413436","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current research on aging has largely focused the molecular mechanisms of age-related diseases, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with several human diseases of aging. However, the cellular mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and how they lead to age-related diseases are not known. Chemical modifications to mitochondrial proteins control several aspects of mitochondrial function, and the long-term goal of this project is to understand how these modifications are regulated by the NAD(+)-dependent sirtuin deacylases and influence the diseases of aging. The objective of this proposal is to define the role of SIRT5 in the molecular mechanisms of aging. The central hypothesis is that SIRT5 regulates mitochondrial function by removing a newly discovered acyl modification from mitochondrial proteins. In the absence of SIRT5, mitochondrial proteins will become hyper-acylated, have reduced mitochondrial function, and exhibit several markers of accelerated aging. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on preliminary data, which suggests an important role for SIRT5 in the cellular mechanisms of aging and disease. To test these hypotheses, three specific aims will be pursued: 1. Determine the changes in protein acylation as a function of age, using a proteomic strategy to quantify hepatic mitochondrial protein acylation from young, middle-aged, and old mice; 2. Determine the effect of this novel acyl modification on protein function by using a combination of cell and murine models, in order to measure the changes in protein activity of specific proteins, as well as the overall function of mitochondria; 3. Determine role of SIRT5 on aging by measuring several physiological parameters of aging using both in vitro cellular assays and in vivo assays in mice, to determine how SIRT5 maintains mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis during aging. This study combines a novel protein modification, a comprehensive experimental design, and an innovative conceptual framework. Furthermore, this study will build a foundation for this early-stage investigator and ensure a successful research program focused on the cellular mechanisms of aging and disease. Importantly, the proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand understanding how mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to age-related diseases. Ultimately such knowledge has the potential to inform the development of new therapies against several diseases of aging."
"9448431","Project Summary/Abstract Epigenetic regulatory pathways governing gene expression are intimately involved in the regulation of early heart development and cardiac remodeling under pathological stress. Disrupting the cardiac transcriptional networks during early heart development and cardiac regeneration may lead to heart diseases. Among all the known epigenomic modifiers, the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) protein family is a relatively new member found to mediate the reversal of DNA methylation in the mammalian genome. The TET dioxygenases (TET1-3) are capable of converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5hmC) and further oxidized species, thereby promoting active DNA demethylation. The dynamic changes in 5mC/ 5hmC distributions and transcriptional reprogramming play vital roles during early CM development, a critical period that also provides an optimal time window to study fundamental epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that govern cardiac gene transcription. Our own preliminary studies revealed that genetic depletion of Tet proteins in mice impaired early cardiomyocyte (CM) development. At the cellular level, Tet-deficient CMs further exhibited reduced proliferation and metabolic dysfunction. At the molecular level, upon Tet deletion, we observed massive changes in DNA methylation and a disorganized chromatin architecture that might account for disrupted cardiac transcriptional networks and abnormal expression of key metabolic genes involved in proliferation, glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in CMs. We hypothesize that the Tet-mediated DNA demethylation pathway is critical for maintaining proper chromatin accessibility and chromatin looping, thereby regulating transcriptional programming to instruct CM development. The immediate availability of a cardiac-specific Tet triple knockout mouse model, as well as a set of innovative tools developed for precise mapping and editing of DNA modifications, has placed us in an extremely competitive position to unravel novel epigenetic regulatory mechanisms controlling CM development. In Aim 1, we will define how Tet/5hmC regulate chromatin accessibility and the binding of key transcriptional factors to their targets to program essential transcriptional outputs and maintain proper CM development. In Aim 2, we will examine how Tet/5hmC regulate chromatin looping by interplaying with enhancer and insulator elements at critical genomic loci to control metabolic gene expression during CM development. Upon completion of our proposed studies, we anticipate to establish a new paradigm by introducing a previously underappreciated dimension in the epigenetic regulation of the cardiovascular system. Findings from our proposed studies will also provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac gene transcription and heart development, thereby forming a solid basis for developing potential epigenetic therapies to prevent and treat congenital heart diseases."

"9448732","PROJECT SUMMARY There currently exists a fundamental gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the specification of cardiovascular subtypes, such as atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, epicardium, endothelium smooth muscle cells during development. This represents an important problem because it prevents the complete comprehension, and therefore also the treatment of congenital heart disease, which affects ~1% of newborns. Importantly, this knowledge gap hinders the translational approach of generating defined cardiovascular cell types from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) based on the concept of reproducing known principles of normal development in culture.  The long-term goal of our work is to better understand the underlying mechanisms directing specification and differentiation of the cardiovascular lineages. The overall objective of this application is to identify the specific mechanisms that determine ventricular cell fate specification and differentiation during mouse development in vivo and to translate these insights to the hPSC differentiation system to efficiently generate human ventricular cardiomyocytes in vitro. The central hypothesis is that ventricular progenitor cells can be identified, isolated and characterized early during development, by lineage-tracing of Foxa2, and that this progenitor population can be reproduced during hPSC differentiations. This hypothesis has been formulated based on preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory, demonstrating that prospective ventricular cells can be identified as early as during gastrulation, using Foxa2 as a marker. Foxa2 expression and subsequent lineage-tracing enable monitoring of these cells over the course of their specification and differentiation. In Aim 1, prospective ventricular cells will be isolated and analyzed molecularly at key stages during development to identify the relevant signaling pathways and gene regulatory mechanisms responsible for ventricular specification and differentiation. In Aim 2, the hPSC model system will be used, along with ventricular-specific reporter cell lines, cell surface antibody screening technology, and small molecule pathway modulations to establish robust protocols for the generation and characterization of pure human ventricular cardiomyocytes.  This approach effectively combines complementary model systems to examine specification mechanisms of ventricular cells during heart development. We expect results from our studies to advance the understanding of heart development by uncovering key regulators of early cardiac specification. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to have a broad translational impact in the understanding of congenital heart disease, and for the generation of therapeutically relevant and safe cell populations from hPSCs."
"9415436","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases."
"9583913","Project Summary The GENERAL AIM of this proposal is to qualitatively advance knowledge on urinary metabolic phenotypes and biochemical pathways associated with the direct effect on blood pressure (BP) of high sodium (Na) intake and the inverse BP effect (BP reduction) of the DASH/OmniHeart- like eating pattern. To achieve this aim, we will identify and quantify key metabolites related to these contrasting BP influences, and use state-of-the-art chemometrics, statistical spectroscopy, computational network and pathway modeling tools to identify and map de novo pathways associated with Na-BP and DASH/OmniHeart-BP. We will then test and validate the INTERMAP derived metabolites and pathways using available data and samples from the INTERMAP China Prospective (ICP) Study, the Urinary Sodium Study (USS), and the OmniHeart Trial. The goal is to develop more focused and effective strategies for population- wide BP lowering through improved non-pharmacologic approaches, primarily nutritional, as well as to identify new targets for drug intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to identify urinary metabolites and associated pathways related to Na-BP and DASH/OmniHeart-BP, link these to dietary and other data, and with extensive validation in other cohorts, prospective and trial data."
"9532366","Molecular processes that underlie the induction and consolidation of long-term memory (LTM) are the subjects of intensive research, and studies are providing a wealth of empirical data that relate aspects of memory to specific intracellular signaling pathways. For example, empirical studies are elucidating the roles played by extracellular factors (e.g. growth factors), kinase activity, and transcriptional regulation in induction and consolidation of memory. Due in part to the complexity and nonlinear features of these molecular pathways, it is difficult to develop an intuitive understanding of the ways in which these pathways respond to stimulus protocols or pharmacological manipulations or are affected by single-site molecular lesions. To provide a better understanding of the processes underlying LTM, the present proposal will develop quantitative models of the molecular pathways that underlie two well-characterized models of LTM: i) long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) and ii) long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). Parameters will be constrained by empirical data. Parameter sensitivity analysis and a novel cluster analysis will assess model robustness. Aim 1 will extend our model for LTF, which describes the regulation of transcription by PKA and ERK via phosphorylation of the transcription factors CREB1 and CREB2. The extended model will include components of additional intra- and extracellular feedback loops (e.g., TGF?, and ApNT), an additional transcription factor (C/EBP), ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK) and p38 MAP kinase. In Aim 2, this model will be used to predict stimulus protocols, as well as pharmacological treatments, that enhance LTF and that rescue impaired LTF. Aim 3 will extend our current model of LTP, which describes roles of several kinase pathways (e.g., MAPK, PKA, PKC, and CAMKII) and histone acetylation. The model will incorporate a recently delineated BDNF positive-feedback loop, which leads to activation of ERK, phosphorylation of CREB1, and induction of transcription necessary for the consolidation of LTP. We will simulate stimulus protocols and drug effects to predict treatments that could rescue impaired memory mechanisms in Rett syndrome, which is caused by mutations that alter the activity of the transcription factor MeCP2, and that can rescue impaired mechanisms in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, which is caused by mutations in CREB binding protein. This proposed approach of using models to predict novel learning paradigms and/or drug treatments that restore normal plasticity, is an innovative methodology that could ultimately lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of cognitive disorders."
"9544527","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Tuberculosis: Translating Scientific Findings for Clinical and Public Health Impact, organized by Drs. Graeme Meintjes, Eric J. Rubin and Sabine Ehrt. The conference will be held April 15-19, 2018 at Fairmont Chateau in Whistler, British Columbia. It is estimated that one-third of the world?s population is infected with tuberculosis, and each year 10 million people develop disease with 1.5 million tuberculosis-related deaths. Global control efforts using currently available diagnostic, treatment and preventive tools are predicted to achieve only gradual reductions in global tuberculosis incidence. Critical factors impeding tuberculosis control include the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to evade host-killing mechanisms and enter into a phenotypic state of persistence with risk of later reactivation, HIV co-infection which drives progression to disease, the emergence and transmission of drug- resistant strains, and our limited understanding of the immune responses necessary to kill or more effectively contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis and how to elicit these responses with a novel vaccine. Acceleration of progress in TB control requires deeper fundamental insights into the pathogen and pathogen-host interactions, which can then translated into more effective tools at a public health level. Under the theme of translation, this conference will bring together laboratory, clinical and epidemiological tuberculosis researchers to engage the key scientific questions in tuberculosis science including persistence, metabolic adaptation, immune evasion, prediction and early diagnosis of progression to disease, drug resistance, discovery of novel drug targets, and determinants of morbidity and mortality. This will allow for cross-talk between disciplines and triangulation of research findings from epidemiological and clinical studies and laboratory and animal models. This conference will explore what fundamental insights are needed to advance TB control and how fundamental insights can be translated into clinical and public health impact. For the first time, the meeting is held jointly with the Keystone Symposia ?HIV and Co-Infections: Pathogenesis, Inflammation and Persistence,? which will facilitate discussion around HIV and tuberculosis co-infection and explore synergies in the respective fields."
"9453382","PROJECT SUMMARY Through cohesive advancements in protein engineering, bioconjugation chemistry and sophisticated nanotechnology, innovations in targeted nanotherapeutics have made significant progress in increasing the specificity of anticancer nanomedicines. However, as a consequence of the complexity of modular targeted nanoconjugates (TNCs), in vivo selectivity, and subsequent treatment outcomes, frequently suffer setbacks. The capacity to accurately resolve intratumoral molecular and cellular selectivity of TNCs in vivo is oftentimes thwarted by dominant macrophysiological factors. Such factors include macro-scale quantification of TNC tumor delivery, which provides little insight into micro-scale cancer cell-specific molecular binding events and internalization of TNCs present within the interstitium. Additional factors include variable pharmacokinetics of non-selective nanoconjugate controls, and unparalleled physiologies of target-null tumors; both which hamper the accurate experimental comparisons needed to evaluate novel TNCs. To this end, Dual-Tracer Fluorescence Imaging (DT-FI) will be deployed, which provides accurate in vivo quantitation of tumor target molecular binding of TNCs via a Binding Potential metric, a combined measure of binding affinity and respective tumor target receptor concentration. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is debilitating and manifests at critical anatomical sites, requiring highly selective treatments to preserve function and aesthetics. Aside from indiscriminate surgery, chemo- and radiotherapy, confined spatiotemporal control of cytotoxicity of HNSCC can be imparted by photodynamic therapy (PDT), a promising modality used to manage cancers by the light-activation of photosensitizer (PS) agents. In an effort to improve the cellular selectivity of HNSCC therapy, PS-embedded, chemo-loaded liposomes will be employed in this proposal as a model nanoplatform to surface-graft engineered recombinant targeting moieties. DT-FI will be leveraged as a critical means of directing the engineering of the photoactive TNCs to improve outcomes of PDT-based treatments in HNSCC. To guide Dr. Obaid's transition to independence, a mentoring committee has been assembled to complement his training in chemical nanoscience. Mentorship by Dr. Tayyaba Hasan will train Dr. Obaid on PDT-based cancer nanomedicines and tumor biology response. Co-mentorship by Dr. Brian Pogue will train Dr. Obaid in quantitative in vivo DT-FI. Additional distinguished members include Dr. Brian Seed, a specialist in protein engineering, Dr. Andrew Tsourkas, a nanoconjugation expert, Dr. Eben Rosenthal, Otolaryngologist and pioneer in HNSCC imaging, and Dr. William Faquin, a HNSCC pathophysiology expert. As a well-defined and distinct transition to independence, the infrastructure established in the mentored phase will be adapted to the engineering of multi-specific photo-chemotherapeutic nanoplatforms tailored for in vivo heterogeneity of HNSCC models. The approach established in this K99/R00 mechanism will enable future designs of various TNCs, as directed by in vivo DT-FI, with the capacity for targeting dynamic disease-specific molecular targets."
"9435720","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Theoretical models of alcohol use disorder (AUD) argue that dysfunction in frontal lobe-mediated neural circuitry contributes to executive function deficits that are hallmark neurocognitive features of the disorder. Empirical support for these models is extensive, with prior studies reporting pronounced deficits in cortical thickness and white matter integrity in the frontal lobes and associated regions. However, considerably less is known about the impact of AUD on myelinated neurons localized in deeper cortical layers (i.e., intracortical myelin; ICM). These ICM fibers play a crucial role in speeding and synchronizing of neural signals throughout cortex, thereby helping to support optimal cognitive functioning. We hypothesize that ICM deficits directly contribute to executive function impairment in AUD. Importantly, standard techniques for quantifying cortical thickness via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lack neurobiological specificity with respect to the disruption of un-myelinated vs. myelinated cortical tissue in AUD. However, recent methodological advances in structural MRI have enabled in vivo estimation of ICM thickness. The proposed study will utilize a recently-developed T1- weighted pulse sequence that yields high intracortical contrast to examine deficits in ICM as a novel neural marker of AUD. The study has three aims: 1) to compare ICM thickness between individuals with AUD and matched controls; 2) to examine associations between ICM and clinical indicators of alcohol misuse (drinking quantity/frequency and AUD severity) and three domains of executive functioning (response inhibition, delay discounting, working memory) and processing speed; and 3) to explore sex differences in ICM. As the first investigation of ICM in AUD, this study will provide proof-of-concept of whether deficits in ICM are present in comparison with control individuals as well as contextualize variation in ICM within relevant clinical and neurocognitive indices of AUD. If successful, the study will also provide preliminary data for a future longitudinal R01 study investigating the predictive utility of ICM and its recovery over the course of AUD treatment. In sum, we believe that the ICM imaging approach is a distinct methodological innovation that has considerable potential to increase our ability to disentangle subtle differences in cortical morphology that may serve as novel neural markers of AUD in future clinical and research applications."
"9615578","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common and serious complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), while the closely related graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effect is crucial for the effectiveness of allo-HCT for blood cancer patients. Adrenergic stress signaling mediated through ?- adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists such as norepinephrine is recognized to influence both innate and adaptive immunity. To investigate the previously unknown role of ?-AR signaling in GVHD, we used murine models to perform allo-HCT in which recipient mice were treated with specific ?-AR antagonists or agonists. Our findings show that agonistic stimulation of ?2-AR signaling significantly decreased GVHD while blocking of ?2-AR signaling significantly increased GVHD. We have also found that manipulating endogenous levels of norepinephrine, by exposing mice to a physiological stress (i.e. mild cold stress) completely recapitulates the findings obtained using pharmacologic manipulation of ?-AR signaling. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that stress-induced ?2-adrenergic signaling may control GVH and GVL responses via regulating the functions of donor-derived T cell subsets. Importantly, these findings suggest that manipulation of ?2-AR signaling is a feasible and immediately testable strategy to improve the effectiveness of allo-HCT. Therefore, we will study HCT patients and murine models to pursue three aims. Aim 1 will examine norepinephrine blood levels in allo-HCT patients as a potential factor influencing clinical outcomes. We will study about 200 de- identified patients to analyze the relationship between ?-adrenergic signaling levels and clinical outcomes including GVHD incidence, severity and cancer relapse. Aim 2 will evaluate the therapeutic potential of manipulating ?-AR signaling to modulate GVH and GVL responses. We have recently established a xenotransplantation system using humanized NSG mice as hosts to examine the GVH and GVL functions of human immune cells. We will use this new translational platform to evaluate the impact of manipulating ?-AR signaling on the GVH and GVL activities of human T cells. Aim 3 will explore T cell-dependent mechanisms by which ?2-AR signaling impacts GVH and GVL responses. We will use ?2-AR deficient mice as donors to determine how ?2-AR signaling affects the functions of major T cell subsets known to dictate the onset and severity of GVHD and to mediate the favorable GVL effect. In summary, this project will not only improve our understanding of the basic biology of allo-HCT, but it may also help to explain why patients, who naturally exhibit widely differing stress responses, differ so widely in terms of their development of GVHD or cancer remission. Moreover, this research may lead to a completely new therapeutic rationale based upon manipulation of ?-AR signaling for the prevention of GVHD and preservation of the beneficial GVL effect."
"9539453","Project Abstract In patients with heart failure (HF), accurate differentiation among ischemic and various non-ischemic cardiomyopathies (NICMs) is essential for appropriate guidance of therapies. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI is an ideal non-invasive imaging method for depicting myocardial scarring and fibrosis, but is not well suitable for HF patients due to the requirement of many breath-holds and limited specificity to distinguish various forms of NICM. While LGE MRI is based on static analysis of the concentration of contrast agent at a single post-injection time, contrast uptake and washout is actually a temporally dynamic process, the pattern of which varies depending on specific pathological conditions. If accurately captured, the contrast kinetics may improve the tissue characterization particularly for differentiating NICMs that are associated with different etiologies. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop so-called early-to-late gadolinium enhancement (ELGE) MRI methods which capture contrast uptake and wash-out over time and to utilize the resultant kinetics information for differentiating various NICMs. Towards this goal, we will first develop respiratory motion corrected 3D LGE imaging methods which enable whole heart coverage during free-breathing. This will be achieved by integrating novel MRI components such as 3D stack-of-spirals acquisition, outer volume suppression magnetization preparation and 1D projection-based motion estimator. Then, ELGE measurement will be done in NICM patients by repeating the free-breathing scan between 1min through 40 min post injection. After parameterization of ELGE time curves, classification rules will be established to distinguish myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy and sarcoidosis that justify a larger clinical study."
"9449479","PROJECT SUMMARY Glioblastomas (GBMs), the most common and deadly primary malignant brain tumors, frequently display mutations that activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the Pi-3 kinase-Akt (PI3K) signaling pathway. Yet, to date, drugs that directly inhibit RTK and/or PI3K signaling have proven ineffective in treatment of GBM. Our research program uses complementary experimental model systems, including patient-derived primary GBM stem cell cultures and novel GBM models in Drosophila melanogaster, to identify and interrogate genetic and cellular processes that underlie glial tumorigenesis. Using our GBM model systems, we identified RIOK2, a highly conserved atypical serine-threonine kinase, and our results revealed that, in GBMs, RIOK2 becomes overexpressed in response to RTK-PI3K signaling to drive tumor cell proliferation and survival, and that RIOK2 knockdown in RTK-PI3K dependent GBM cells inhibits proliferation and elicits apoptosis. Our preliminary data also indicate that, in both Drosophila and human GBM models, inhibition of RIOK2 catalytic activity strongly counteracts RTK-PI3K-driven transformation. In contrast, loss or inhibition of RIOK2 activity in normal human or Drosophila glial progenitor/stem cells does not elicit cell death and does not dramatically affect cell proliferation. Thus, RTK-PI3K mutant tumor cells, but not normal glial cells, are dependent on RIOK2 activity for their growth and survival. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that RIOK2 drives GBM by phosphorylating and activating RNA-binding proteins to promote the translation of oncogenic target mRNAs, and that RIOK2 differentially promotes the growth and survival of GBM cells by stimulating the translation of oncogenic mRNAs that are expressed as a consequence of gliomagenic RTK and PI3K signaling. This proposal focuses two aims designed to Aim 1) Determine the mechanisms of interaction between RIOK2 and its associated RNA-binding proteins, and Aim 2) Determine if RIOK2 activity specifically promotes translation of select target mRNAs in tumor cells. This project may reveal new mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis, and establish a basis for developing RIOK2 inhibitors for potential targeted treatment for GBM."
"9531967","UC Davis Cardiovascular Symposium Systems Approach to Understanding Cardiac Excitation-Contraction and Arrhythmias ? Mechanics and Energetics in Heart diseases and Arrhythmias ABSTRACT Heart diseases remain the leading cause of death, but still without effective drug therapies. In order to develop better and more effective therapies to treat heart diseases, it is critically important for scientists and physicians to obtain in-depth and accurate understanding of the heart disease mechanisms. In recent decades, researchers studying heart diseases in the field have been accumulating more and more experimental data from molecular, to cellular, and to tissue and organ levels. However, important conceptual advances in the cardiac field require integration of the knowledge from multiple scales. Here we propose to take the necessary step forward to integrate experimental data into quantitative models that enable using mathematical tools and computational power to understand the complex interactions of the cells and molecules in the heart. The unique design of this conference series is to combine experimental study and mathematical modeling to achieve in-depth understanding of the dynamic systems that control cardiac function and heart diseases.  The proposed interdisciplinary conference is the 5th in this series entitled ?System's Approach to Understand Cardiac Excitation-Contraction Coupling?. The previous conferences have received overwhelmingly positive evaluations from attendees and resulted in high impact publications. The proposed conference will combine experimental and modeling studies in the field of Mechanics and Energetics, with topics focused on the cutting edge research in cardiac mechanics, mechanotransduction, and feedback between energetics and mechanics in heart diseases and arrhythmias. The emphasis of this conference will be on (1) summarizing current state of research in the focus area, (2) identifying consensus and controversy that warrant more investigation, (3) exchanging ideas, data, and information among the experimentalists and modelers to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations. The conference results will be summarized in the form of comprehensive review papers which will be published in leading scientific journals that have broad impact on the research community."
"9437619","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, disabling condition that occurs in a subgroup of individuals after experiencing traumatic stress, and is common in Veterans seeking mental health treatment at the VA. Although evidence-based psychosocial treatments exist for PTSD, a substantial portion of individuals do not fully respond to treatment. Thus, there is a clear need to continue researching novel interventions for PTSD in Veterans. Recently, new interventions for mental health disorders have utilized computerized cognitive training techniques in order to improve the functioning of cognitive systems and reduce symptoms. This type of intervention, often referred to as neurotherapeutics, may hold promise for PTSD as a method for ameliorating symptoms and improving cognition. Individuals with PTSD demonstrate difficulties with cognitive control functions, which appear to be causally implicated in symptoms of the disorder (e.g., intrusive trauma- related memories). To date the efficacy of neurotherapeutics for PTSD has been understudied in Veterans.  The current proposal aims to bridge research on basic neurocognitive mechanisms of PTSD with intervention research by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a cognitive control training program in 80 Veterans with PTSD. Veterans will complete computer-based training exercises designed to specifically target and improve aspects of cognitive control. Veterans will complete the program twice per week for eight weeks. Symptoms will be assessed before and after treatment, as well as at a two- month follow up time point. The primary goal of the study is to examine the effect of the intervention on PTSD symptoms and cognitive deficits. Evaluating symptom change as a result of the intervention will provide critical data regarding the utility of this program as a PTSD treatment. If effective, this training program could serve as alternative treatment option for Veterans with PTSD, and could be translated into an easily transportable intervention for dissemination (e.g., through web-based platforms). A secondary goal is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to better understand the mechanisms by which cognitive training culminates in symptom reduction. If training cognitive control with neurotherapeutics directly enhances functioning of specific neural substrates as hypothesized, improvements in affective processes relying on shared neural regions would also be predicted. Modifying functioning in these substrates with training may thus reduce symptoms by improving neural functioning while processing and managing trauma-related affect and information. Neural systems used for cognitive control targeted in the training described (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC]) are also recruited when individuals mentally manipulate emotional information, such as when individuals use reappraisal to change the way that they think about negative emotional situations or content. In this study, Veterans will complete a neutral cognitive control task and a reappraisal task while undergoing fMRI before and after completing the training treatment. This will be the first study to evaluate neurobiological mechanisms of this type of training in PTSD, which is a fundamental next step for understanding how to improve the training program and who may be best served by completing it.  Building upon the applicant's prior experience with clinical trials and cognitive training research, the proposed training plan provides an opportunity for new hands-on training in neuropsychology, cognitive rehabilitation, and functional neuroimaging techniques to meet the immediate goal of developing skills in these domains. Long term, the award will facilitate development of expertise with integration of neurobiological tools with intervention research, and provide critical pilot data for successful preparation of a VA Merit Award. Together, the research and training plan will make the applicant well-poised to transition to an independent clinical scientist role within the VA system."
"9545299","Project Summary/Abstract: Many flaviviruses such as Dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Yellow Fever virus cause significant human diseases. However, no clinically approved antiviral therapy is available for treatment of flavivirus infections. Therefore, the development of vaccines and antiviral agents for prevention and treatment of flavivirus infections is a clear public health priority. The long- range goal of this proposal is to address this need by developing a new system to identify, screen and validate a class of potential flavivirus inhibitors, and successfully identify and analyze candidate compounds that show promise in disrupting viral survival. During flaviviral infection of the host cell, a single viral polyprotein is synthesized from the viral genome. This polyprotein is cleaved into its component proteins by a combination of host cell proteases and a two-component viral protease, encoded in genes NS2B and NS3. The function of this viral protease is indispensable for virus assembly and replication. The objectives of this project are to develop innovative high throughput screening strategies to identify and characterize compounds that orthosterically inhibit the function of the critical protease NS2B- NS3. To achieve project objectives, in Specific Aim 1, we will develop and perform novel high- throughput screening primary, secondary, and tertiary assays capable of screening large chemical libraries to identify orthosteric inhibitors. In Specific Aim 2, after optimizing these assays, we will perform large-scale HTS to screen a compound library of >400,000 compounds for potential protease inhibitor candidates, employing five levels of screening to fully eliminate false positives. In Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the efficacy of the resulting candidate compounds for their capacity to block protease activity, and determined their modes of actions. Lead compounds against the protease will be tested for cellular toxicity, reduction of flavivirus titer in cell culture, resistant variants, and limited structure-activity relationship. We will ultimately test the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in live animals for the most potent compounds. We anticipate the outcome of this study will be the generation of crucial new information on flavivirus inhibitor-enzyme interaction at structurally significant sites. This creates the potential for identifying novel classes of flaviviral inhibitors, suitable for addressing the global public health need for new antiviral agents to fight flaviviruses."
"9419929","Inhibiting the oncogene c-Myc and mutant KRas remains a major challenge in cancer research. c-Myc and KRas are hyperactive in more than 70% of all human cancers, and contribute to resistance to therapies. However, drugs that directly inhibit c-Myc or mutant KRas have not yet been developed. c- Myc and KRas are key oncogenic drivers in colorectal cancer, a leading cause of cancer death; nearly 100% of colorectal cancers depend on c-Myc, while KRas mutations occur in ~50% of colorectal cancers. Recent findings indicate that post-translational modification by the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifiers (SUMO) play a critical role in c-Myc and KRas-dependent oncogenesis; however, the mechanisms of how SUMOylaton is involved in c-Myc and KRas-dependent oncogenesis are not well understood. Wnt-signaling pathways could be a critical link of SUMOylation to both c-Myc activation and KRas mutation in colorectal cancers. Dysregulated Wnt-signaling leads to increased c-Myc expression and activity. In addition, KRas mutation suppresses the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, thereby enhancing the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway. Wnt signaling is also key to maintaining the pool of cancer stem cells in a wide range of cancers. During the previous funding period, we found that inhibition of SUMOylation significantly suppressed Wnt down-stream targets, including c-Myc. Key proteins, both in the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, have been recently shown to be substrates of SUMOylation. However, the current understanding of how SUMOylation regulates the Wnt pathways is incomplete, and thus will be investigated here using colorectal cancer as a model system. We will conduct a combination of structural studies and chemical synthesis to determine the mechanism of allosteric inhibition by our lead small molecule SUMOylation inhibitor. We will conduct biochemical and molecular biological studies to elucidate the mechanism of SUMOylation in the Wnt signaling pathways. Finally, we will determine the therapeutic efficacy of our lead SUMOylation small molecule inhibitor in c-Myc and KRas-dependent colorectal cancers. We expect that the proposed studies will lead to a new paradigm by providing proof of principle for much-needed therapies that target c-Myc and KRas and dysregulated Wnt-signaling. Our work will also have implications for the many other cancers that are dependent on c-Myc and KRas. !"
"9486073","Project Summary Complications from infections caused by difficult to treat Gram-negative pathogens resistant to multiple antibiotics (the MDR phenotype) has become a major public health threat. The basis of resistance in the most important members of this group, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is the poor penetration of the antibiotics through a relatively impermeable bacterial cell envelope and their expulsion (efflux) by various pumps expressed by the microorganisms. Consequently, the intracellular concentrations of antibiotic are kept below bactericidal levels. This proposal aims at creating new classes of diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents to combat efflux-based resistance by a project organized into two phases. First, we will develop genetically encoded fluorescent sensors activated by binding of antibiotics following their entry into the bacterial cytoplasm. This tool will enable us to measure antibiotic flux under different environmental conditions and on a single cell basis. During the second phase of the project, working with our industrial partner, we will implement a screening program, using a library of several hundred billion small molecules, to identify inhibitors targeting different components of efflux pumps. These inhibitors should activate the fluorescent detector by causing enhanced intracellular accumulation of the antibiotics resulting from inhibition of efflux. Functional studies are proposed to assess the ability of the active compounds to promote killing of P. aeruginosa by antibiotics that are normally expelled by the efflux pumps. Crystal structures of inhibitors bound to target proteins will be determined and these will guide medicinal chemistry efforts with the goal of creating additional derivatives with increased potencies and expanded spectrum, capable of inhibiting efflux pumps of other important Gram-negative pathogens."
"9634277","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To date, 2,937 genes underlying 4,163 Mendelian conditions (MCs) has been discovered. However, the genetic basis of over 3,000 MCs remains unknown, and hundreds of novel MCs are described each year. In 2011, the NHGRI and NHLBI established the Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG) to facilitate large-scale discovery of genes responsible for MCs. In Phase-1 of the CMG program, and in partnership with 182 investigators from 117 institutions in 27 countries, the University of Washington CMG (UW-CMG) assessed 6,598 samples from 2,404 families and has, to date, produced 4,116 exome and 97 whole genome sequences. This extensive collaborative effort resulted in an unparalleled pace of discovery with the identification of genes for 237 MCs, including 123 novel discoveries. The translation and impact of these discoveries on diagnostics and clinical care has been immediate and substantial-when combined with discoveries made by the genetics community at-large, variants in genes identified as underlying MCs since 2012 represent ~25% of positive results in clinical diagnostic efforts. Additionally, the UW-CMG has developed multiple new analytical tools including CADD, PRIMUS, SimRare, STAR, RV-TDT, CHP, VAT and Spliceosaurus as well as methodological innovations including MIPs, smMIPs and approaches for low input exome and genome sequencing. The UW-CMG remains deeply committed to open data sharing with rolling submission of eligible exome and genome data to dbGaP (614 deposited and 1,748 pending deposition) and development of a new data browser (http://geno2mp.gs.washington.edu) that, for the first time, publicly provides anonymized links between individual-level genotypes, from over 3,000 exomes, to individual clinical phenotypes, defined by Human Phenotype Ontology terms. In this renewal application, we build from these successes to maximize novel gene discovery for MCs, capitalizing on immediate access to >22,000 sequence-ready samples from >16,500 families and 163 MCs, access to several large cohorts of birth defects totaling more than 24,000 trios (>94,000 samples total) and an aggressive sample solicitation plan including case aggregation and case matching of undiagnosed patients who have undergone clinical exome sequencing. We propose four specific aims: (1) Solicit, organize, and curate phenotypic information and DNA samples from families with unexplained (i.e., no known underlying gene) MCs from sample custodians around the world, by submission to our center of either samples for sequencing or sequence data for further analysis; (2) Apply our established production pipeline for exome and genome sequencing to samples corresponding to unexplained MCs and to improve this process through ongoing technology innovation; (3) Determine the genetic basis of as many unexplained MCs as is possible, maximizing novel discovery, by use of efficient study design and effective, innovative analysis; (4) Take a leadership role to disseminate and openly share methods and data to promote worldwide efforts to discover the full complement of genes underlying MCs."
"9413444","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A series of marine natural products isolated from the sponge of Verongida have been intensively studied due to the presence of alkaloids with one, or more bromotyrosine residues. Many of these alkaloid metabolites show interesting bioactivity and cytotoxic properties in tumor cell lines. The natural product, 11-Deoxyfistularin-3 is cytotoxi against the estrogen dependant human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 (LD50 = 17 mg/L). The World Health Organization (WHO) recently predicted that death caused by cancer is expected to increase to 13.1 million by 2030. Among all other deadly cancers, invasive breast cancer is the most recurrently diagnosed malignant tumor among women (31% in the US and 27% in Europe) and the second leading cause of cancer related death subsequent to lung cancer. Women have a 32% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and 15% risk of breast cancer causing death in the US. We plan to address the challenge of improving the aforementioned statistics through developing derivatives of the natural product, 11-deoxyfustularin-3, that will have sub-micromolar activity against MCF-7 breast cancer. This research project has three main objectives. The first objective is to develop a synthetic methodology that can be applied toward the asymmetric total synthesis of the biologically active natural product, 11-deoxyfistularin-3. Secondly, we plan to construct synthetic analogues of the natural product to determine if a segment of the natural product can also display biological activity against MCF-7 cells. Our final objective is to determine if any of the MCF-7 active synthetic analogues and the natural product can effectively bind to estrogen receptors. The data generated from these binding assays will lead to theoretical docking studies of the ligand-receptor interactions of the biologically active compound and the estrogen receptor, and the generation of a structure-activity relationship profile of these compounds could potentially lead to the construction of synthetic analogues that possess sub-micromolar activity against breast cancer cells."
"9418030","Abstract:  Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a chronic disease that predictably leads to colorectal cancer if left untreated. Clinical trials have shown that COXIBs (selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors), a subclass of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that were originally developed to treat arthritis, effectively reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer in FAP patients. However, this class of drugs cannot be used clinically to treat FAP due to their severe systemic side effects including unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac thrombus. Drug companies have had to withdraw the chemopreventive indication of approved COXIBs (i.e., celecoxib) from the market due to these serious side effects. In this application, we propose to develop recycled colon bioavailable (r-CB) drugs to localize the active COXIBs in the colon by targeting enterohepatic circulation (EHC) via structure modification, resulting in low systemic drug exposure and high colonic drug exposure, thereby reducing the systemic side effects without sacrificing their efficacy. In the preliminary study, we have synthesized a few compounds and identified one (GS1) that is a potent COX-2 inhibitor undergoing efficient EHC. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that COX-2 inhibitor GS1 can effectively prevent or slow down the process of colon carcinogenesis with low systemic exposure in animal models relevant to FAP. Our long-term goal is to develop highly active r-CB COXIBs for the prevention of colorectal cancer that have limited or no systemic side effects in FAP patients. To prove the feasibility of r-CB drugs, we will: (1) evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy and systemic exposure of GS1 using the Pirc rat model (Aim 1); and (2) identify the transporter(s) facilitating EHC and evaluate the impact of EHC on the drug distribution using cell culture and/or animal models (Aim 2). The successful completion of this project will allow us to demonstrate that r-CB drugs that are only bioavailable in the colon can be created. This would enable selective treatment or prevention of the colonic cancer without severe systemic side effects. In addition, this project will allow us to generate preliminary data for the preparation of an R01-level proposal. It is expected that the research community will use this approach to develop drugs for the treatment of other colonic diseases; especially those related to COX-2- mediated colon carcinogenesis."
"9598013","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Penetrating recording microelectrode arrays are a crucial component of numerous human neuroprosthetics.  Obtaining selective, high fidelity, long-lasting readouts of brain activity is a critical technology across basic and applied neuroscience that impacts learning and memory studies as well as motor, pre-motor, and visual cortex neuroprostheses and brain-computer interfaces.  However, implantation of cortical microelectrodes causes a reactive tissue response, which results in a degradation of the preferred functional single-unit performance over time, thus limiting the device capabilities.  Insertion of neural probes or microelectrodes inevitably disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and causes microhemorrhages that have been shown to trigger the inflammatory tissue response cascade.  The degree of microhemorrhaging from probe insertion has been shown to be uncontrollable and difficult to reproduce across implants, mirroring the large variability in inflammatory tissue responses and chronic recording success.  We hypothesize that the level of BBB damage impacts chronic neural recording quality.  This proposal aims to characterize the sustained BBB breakdown and chronic recording failure in vivo caused by the insertion induced BBB disruption and BBB occlusion by quantifying structural, cellular, and molecular level tissue response to chronic implants in the brain in real time through combining multiphoton imaging technology and neural engineering technology at the University of Pittsburgh.  A dynamic understanding of the interfaces is necessary for elucidating the mechanism(s) behind neural recording failure.  This work has the potential to output basic and clinical science level knowledge relevant to neural engineering, ischemia, stroke, intracortical hemorrhage, aneurysm, traumatic brain injury, and closed-loop neurostimulation."
"9415074","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midnight is no longer mid-night for individuals in the developed world. Many adolescents and young adults are awake and active at midnight. Artificial lighting, caffeine, and alarms have enabled this dissociation of sleep/wake+light/dark schedules from the external environment. In addition, many individuals have different schedules on work/school and non-work/non-school days, with later bedtimes, later wake times, and more frequent naps on non-work/non-school days. We and others have found correlations between irregular sleep/wake schedules and later circadian timing, poorer mood, poorer academic performance, and some health metrics, such as weight and psychiatric disorders. These, however, are correlations and not causal links. Identifying mechanisms by which modifiable behaviors, such as variable sleep timing, impact physiology is vital to developing effective educational or treatment-based strategies. We propose an experiment to test the effects of irregular and regular sleep/wake schedules on circadian timing, sleep, cognitive performance, mood, and learning. We will study a young adult population, as this is a time in human development when variable sleep schedules are prevalent and the consequences of irregular schedules on circadian timing, sleep propensity, performance, mood, and learning may be pronounced. The results from the proposed work will allow us to determine if it is the irregularity of the sleep/wake light/dark (SW/LD) schedule that delays circadian timing and disrupts performance, mood, and learning. Using our Sleep Regularity Index (SRI, a quantitative measure of sleep regularity), we will identify and select individuals with Irregular and Regular sleep/wake schedules based on the individual's sleep-wake pattern during three weeks of outpatient screening at home. Individuals from each group will then be randomly assigned to either an Irregular or Regular SW/LD schedule for an inpatient assessment. Assessments of circadian phase, sleep propensity, cognitive performance including vigilant attention, sleep-dependent and long-term learning, and mood will be conducted during the inpatient portion of the study. Our findings will help define physiological links among multiple physiological systems, including sleep/wake, light-sensitive processes (e.g., circadian rhythms, alertness, hormones), cognitive performance, and mood. Reducing scheduled sleep variability has no pharmacologic side-effects and may have additional health benefits. Designing effective therapeutic strategies for reducing variability requires an understanding of the physiological and environmental factors that may mediate and reinforce irregularity. Our results will help to elucidate these mechanisms and will be applicable to high school and college students, as well as adults working shift or night work or experiencing jet-lag. The findings may be utilized in public health forums, including educational campaigns about sleep timing and its effects on circadian rhythms, performance, learning, mood, and safety."
"9537236","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza viruses are constantly changing, requiring the reformulation of vaccines every year. Accurately estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza infection is critical in order to evaluate the protection provided by annua, nationwide vaccination programs. Our long-term goal is to discover more advanced strategies to measure vaccine effectiveness, to potentially reduce the overall burden of influenza infection. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines with the ACIP recommended universal immunization strategy in the Scott and White Memorial Hospital -Temple Population Research Area (SWH-TPRA) adult source population will be systematically investigated. The objective of the proposed work is to explore strategies for measuring vaccine effectiveness against lab-confirmed influenza (VE-LCI) in adult inpatients, including the elderly, who have the highest hospitalization  rates. This includes the identification, implementation and evaluation of innovative, feasible, and  sustainable strategies for measuring VE-LCI in persons aged 18 years or older in acute inpatient care settings. The central hypothesis is that timely and efficient measurement of VE- LCI in adult inpatients is feasible and sustainable in the U.S. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify innovative, feasible, and sustainable strategies to measure VE-LCI in a timely and efficient manner for persons ? 18 years admitted with an acute respiratory illness (ARI) in acute inpatient care settings, 2) Implement the above strategies to measure VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI, and 3) Evaluate the above strategies to measure VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI. To achieve these goals, VE-LCI will be determined in adults admitted to SWMH with ARI who test positive for influenza A and/or B by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The odds of being vaccinated against influenza for PCR-confirmed cases will be compared to age-matched PCR-negative controls, after adjusting for confounders. During 2015- 2016 through 2019-2020, 300 patients and 800 adults admitted to SWMH with an ARI will be eligible to participate in the BSWH CDC VE-LCI adult inpatient study, respectively. Using a test-negative study design, VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI will be measured. Influenza immunization rates will be calculated for the RT-PCR confirmed cases and test negative controls, adjusting VE-LCI for confounders. The approach is innovative because effective measures of the public health impact of increasing influenza immunization on burden of illness will be defined. The proposed research is significant, because it will support improved understanding of timely and efficient measures of VE-LCI, which in turn will support the goal of reducing influenza-associated health burdens."
"9419922","Lead is a heavy metal of great public health concern in the US and globally. In addition to its well- characterized developmental neurotoxicity, cumulative lead exposure is also neurotoxic to adults and can lead to accelerated, persistent cognitive decline in adult humans. The apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE) exists as three polymorphic alleles in humans (?2, ?3, ?4); the ApoE -?3 allele (simplified as ApoE3 hereafter) is the most common allele. The ApoE-?4 allele (simplified as ApoE4 hereafter) is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer?s disease, and accelerated cognitive decline even in the absence of Alzheimer?s disease pathology. The hippocampus is a region of the brain critical for learning and memory, especially spatial learning. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is the process whereby adult neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus leads to the generation and functional integration of adult-born neurons in the hippocampus. These adult-born neurons can influence hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Although adult neurogenesis is modulated by various extracellular stimuli, by the environment, and by neurotoxicants including lead and ethanol, there is a paucity of information regarding the effect of gene-environment interactions (GxE) on adult neurogenesis. This proposal focuses on the effect of lead-genetic background interactions on adult neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory."
"9222047","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MDD is one of the most severe and debilitating illnesses that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Despite considerable advances over the past decades, a clear understanding of the etiology of MDD is still lacking. Accumulating evidence suggests that MDD may arise from impairments in cellular cascades, which lead to aberrant information processing in the circuits that regulate mood, cognition, and neurovegetative functions. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as an important class of small non-coding RNAs that by binding to 3' UTR of mRNAs, suppress the translation and/or stability of specific mRNA targets. Since miRNAs show a highly regulated expression, they contribute in the development and maintenance of a specific transcriptome and thus have the unique ability to influence physiological and disease phenotypes. Our recent studies show that the expression of a group of miRNAs is altered in PFC of MDD subjects and that they are involved in coping response to stress. In addition, accumulative evidence points to the involvement of miRNAs in neural plasticity. These studies suggest a strong possibility that miRNAs may contribute significantly to the etiopathogenesis of MDD. We hypothesize that subsets of miRNAs and their variants, regulated in a coordinated fashion, will show differential co-expression in MDD brain, which by affecting specific neural/synaptic mRNA targets and cellular pathways, will participate in MDD pathogenesis. In well characterized postmortem brain samples obtained from MDD and control subjects, we propose to: 1) profile miRNA expression by small RNA sequencing, identify novel miRNAs, and analyze differentially expressed miRNAs; 2) profile mRNA expression by RNA sequencing and identify regulatory relationships between mRNA and miRNA by mapping co-expression network modules; 3) analyze miRNA-mRNA pairs, validate altered miRNAs and specific target genes experimentally, and localize these changes at the cellular level; 4) analyze pathway associated with differentially co-expressed modules in MDD; 5) examine miRNA biogenesis by determining pri-/pre-miRNAs, RISC complexes, and components of biogenesis machinery; and 6) examine the role of synaptic miRNAs in MDD pathogenesis by determining miRNA enrichment via small RNA sequencing in synaptosomes, analyzing target genes and co-expression modules of miRNA-mRNA specifically altered in the synaptic fraction, and examining pri-/pre-miRNAs and components of miRNA biogenesis machinery at synaptic level. By using a combination of the state-of-the-art high throughput small RNA and RNA sequencing, analyzing data by novel bioinformatics tools and validation, identifying changes in miRNAs and their targets in specific cell type(s), and examining the role of miRNAs at the synaptic level in brain regions implicated in mood and cognition, our proposed study is uniquely positioned to advance the field of MDD research at the molecular level. These investigations will provide novel avenues for the development of miRNAs as ''molecular tools'' with the potential to generate new molecular-based therapies to treat this devastating disorder."
"9617010","R01:Biomimetic Surface for Neural Implant PI: Tracy Cui Implantable microelectrode arrays for neural recording and stimulation have demonstrated tremendous research and clinical potential. Studies of brain tissue response to neural electrode arrays have revealed localized microglia activation, followed by astrocytic scarring and neural degeneration. These reactions are thought to contribute to the low yield and chronic failure of neural recording, although direct links have not been soundly established. Past studies characterizing the CNS response to implants have used postmortem histology at discrete time points. This approach suffers from a large degree of variability and fails to capture the dynamic molecular, cellular and vascular changes of the host. To address this issue, we have developed an experimental set-up to directly image the electrode-tissue interface in live animals using 2-photon microscopy in conjunction with electrical recording. Our previous work indicates that by coating the surface of neural probes with neural adhesion molecules, neuronal density around the device can be promoted while glial reaction attenuated. Meanwhile, neural recording quality is drastically improved. We hypothesize that promoting neuronal growth and health, and/or inhibiting microglia activation will lead to recording improvement. The specific objectives of this project are to investigate the biological mechanisms of the coating's effect on recording and to evaluate the clinical potential of biomimetic coating in a brain machine interface (BMI) model. First, the acute neuronal and microglia responses to coated probes will be characterized in transgenic animals using two photon imaging and electrical recording for two weeks. Real time tissue characteristics (such as neuronal and neurite density, microglia density and morphology, vasculature change and BBB leakage) will be correlated to recording metrics(such as unit yield, SNR, amplitude of signal and noise as well as impedance). Several biomolecules that promote or inhibit neuronal growth or microglia activation will be immobilized on the Blackrock arrays to test our hypothesis. Secondly, the long-term benefit of the coatings on recording will be determine by testing the optimum coating conditions in rats for 6 months. Explants will be taken monthly to examine the coating longevity, while immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis of the tissue at the interface will be performed to characterize the cellular and molecular change over time. Thirdly, to assess the potential of biomimetic coating for clinical application, coated electrodes will be tested in rhesus monkeys in a brain-machine-interface (BMI) model. Recording metrics such as SNR, signal amplitude, unit yield and stability will be quantified over 2 years and compared to uncoated arrays. A novel functional metric will be developed to assess functionality of the recorded signals. BMI performance will be evaluated based on speed and accuracy. This proposal combines the cutting edge real-time imaging, effective biomaterial strategies and state of the art brain machine interface technology to understand the interactions between neural implants and host tissue. The findings will guide the development of seamless neural interface devices for BMI, visual and auditory prosthesis, deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, depression and epilepsy, to name a few. The knowledge will also benefit other brain implants from biochemical sensing and therapeutic delivery to scaffold and stem cell transplant for treating neurological disorders."
"9418099","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms through which tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YRS) exerts its newly recognized role in regulating platelet production and, on the bases of this information, develop a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of thrombocytopenia. In preliminary studies we have determined that YRS exhibits the previously unrecognized property of accelerating megakaryocyte development and platelet generation. This effect appears to be independent of thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling because YRS can support the proliferation and maturation of c-Mpl-/- (TPO receptor knock-out) mouse megakaryocytes in vitro. The studies proposed in this application will establish the mechanisms underlying the novel function of YRS in the regulation of platelet production. We will also develop a pharmaceutical approach to a new class of drugs with the potential of enhancing platelet production in various diseases in which TPO mimetics alone are not effective. In aim 1, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which YRS stimulates megakaryocytopoiesis. Based on preliminary studies, the effect of YRS on megakaryocytopoiesis is mediated by at least two mechanisms: (1) activation of monocytic cells and cytokine production, and (2) expansion of Sca1+CD11b+ progenitors that give rise to hematopoietic cells and vascular cells. We will identify the cells responsible to mediate the effect of YRS and the receptor(s) targeted in the process. Involvement of TLR-MyD88 pathway has been shown by preliminary testing of TLR2-/- and MyD88-/- mice. We will also focus on a unique population of Sca1+CD11b+ progenitor cells that are greatly expanded by YRS stimulation in bone marrow cell cultures. Our preliminary result suggested the differentiation potential of YRS-induced Sca1+CD11b+ progenitor cells into hematopoietic cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. We hypothesize that expansion of these progenitor cells also contributes to thrombocytopoiesis either by differentiating into hematopoietic progenitors or vascular cells that support proplatelet formation in the vascular niche. In aim 2, we will define the functional domains of YRS required to exert the effects on megakaryocytopoiesis, and use protein engineering to de- sign YRS variants with an optimal therapeutic window. In Aim 3, we will test the efficacy of engineered YRS as a potential drug for the treatment of thrombocytopenia using in vivo animal models. In addition to the acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia model employed in preliminary studies, we are generating models of chronic thrombocytopenia induced by low-dose antibody administration, irradiation or chemotherapy to evaluate the effects of YRS in various conditions as may occur in human pathology. Finally, to test the possibility of thrombotic side effects, we will determine whether YRS affects platelet activation, platelet-leukocyte inter- actions and models of thrombosis. The studies proposed in this application will delineate a novel cellular pathway in which YRS contributes to the regulation of platelet production; and support the development of innovative approaches with translational potential for improving the treatment of thrombocytopenia."

Data analysis will be guided by the registry coordinating committee, and will be to identify best practices for SB care and future improvements to the registry."
"9541292","Abstract The inhibitory control and dynamic tuning of cortical circuits is mediated by a diversity of GABAergic cell types, but the biological basis of interneuron identity and diversity is not well understood. Here, we combine developmental genetic, anatomic and transcriptomic approaches to define and discover bona fide cell types within a broad class of cortical interneurons. Parvalbumin containing, fast-spiking basket cells (PVCs) are the largest population of interneurons in the neocortex and integrate in infragranular, granular (layer IV), and supragranular circuits, each with unique input/output connectivity. Recent findings from our laboratory and others suggest heterogeneity in PVC morphology, synaptic properties, and connectivity, but it is uncertain how many of these represent distinct subtypes. Using a developmental genetic strategy, we take advantage of the inside-out laminar specification of PVCs to identify and characterize subtypes based on lineage and birth time restricted cohorts. PVCs are derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and the transition from progenitor to differentiated neuron is marked by the upregulation of proneural transcription factors. By intersecting inducible Ascl1-CreER and Dlx1-CreER mice with PV-Flp mice and an intersectional reporter and inducing in mid-to-late embryogenesis, we have begun parsing adult laminar PVC subtypes for multifactorial single-cell analysis. We quantify the laminar position and morphology of lineage restricted and birth-dated PVC cohorts. We will also carry out single cell RNAseq to analyze their transcription profiles. The integration of morphological and anatomical characterization with single cell RNAseq will increase our understanding of cell identity in PVCs and can potentially uncover new underlying cellular properties. Because PVCs are implicated in schizophrenia, autism, and other mental disorders, their complete profiling at the single cell level could aid in understanding pathophysiology and suggest better treatment strategies."
"9446491","Future-oriented thoughts occupy a prominent position in spontaneous mental activity. They serve an important adaptive function, in that they enable us to represent multiple hypothetical outcomes and act in light of those anticipated outcomes. Although a core feature of PTSD is reliving of past traumatic experiences, the anticipation of future threat plays an important role in maintenance of the disorder. Yet, future thinking has not been systematically evaluated in PTSD. Cognitive neuroscience research has shown that there is considerable overlap between the processes involved in remembering the past and envisioning the future. The well- documented alterations in autobiographical memory in PTSD raise the intriguing possibility of changes in future-oriented cognition in PTSD as well. Nonetheless, because thinking about the future is not simply a mirror image of remembering the past, the study of future thinking in PTSD merits systematic investigation in its own right. The current proposal provides the first comprehensive, theoretically motivated analysis of future thinking in individuals with PTSD. The first part of the proposal assesses the scope of PTSD-associated abnormalities in the simulation and appraisal of positive and negative future events and draws on insights from studies of autobiographical memory in PTSD to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms that may underlie these abnormalities. Further, the neural bases of impairments in future thinking are examined using functional neuroimaging. The second part of the proposal evaluates the implications of alterations in future thinking for decision making by examining how decisions made now are impacted by the way their future outcomes are envisioned in the context of an intertemporal choice task. This section of the proposal also explores the contribution of altered risk assessment and altered valuation of future choices to the observed impairment. The third part of the proposal evaluates the feasibility of enhancing future thinking in PTSD through information- processing manipulations shown to impact future thinking in studies of cognition in healthy individuals. The studies comprising this proposal provide a principled way to gauge the nature of the impairment in future- oriented cognition in PTSD. Further, by uncovering mechanisms responsible for these PTSD-associated abnormalities, this proposal lays the foundation for a theoretically motivated approach to information- processing interventions. Given the important ways in which future thought shapes our emotions, motivations, and actions, understanding future-oriented thought in PTSD has wide-range implications for Veterans' quality of life.  "
"9604916","DESCRIPTION: In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, treated HIV-infected adults have a greater risk of non-AIDS related morbidity, which includes cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive disease, osteoporosis, liver disease, kidney disease, and some cancers. Among the factors that contribute to the risk of non-AIDS complications are antiretroviral drug toxicity,a high prevalence of traditional risk factors (such as substance abuse, obesity, and hypertension), and immune dysfunction and inflammation. In fact, illicit drug use remains the second most common mode of exposure to HIV among AIDS cases nationwide, representing 31% of total diagnoses. In addition to drug use as a factor in initial exposure to HIV, ongoing drug use, correlates of the lifestyles associated with drug use, and lack of access and adherence to treatments for drug use and HIV infection are among the related factors that exacerbate disease progression. In particular, the gastrointestinal tract and its resultant loss of barrier function i a major target for acute HIV infection and drugs of abuse, leading to the occurrence of ischemic lesions secondary to inflammation. Thus, negative synergy between HIV infection and drug use impacting intestinal permeability is central to this proposal. Currently the therapeutic focus for the HIV-infected population is on (i) improved antiretroviral compounds, (ii) cure-based strategies directed at the latent viral reservoir, and (iii) anti-inflammatory, probiotic, antibiotc, and anti-coagulation treatments that target systemic immune activation and hypercoagulability. This application outlines an entirely distinct molecular and cellular target for HIV treatment - repairing the intestinal barrier defect. We reason that HIV- and illicit drug-mediated breakdown in the intestinal mucosa leads to chronic exposure to translocated microbial products, which drive systemic inflammation. These subtle elevations in both inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers are associated with dramatic and sustained increases in risk of all-cause morbidity and mortality in HIV. We therefore propose an innovative three-tiered research strategy to alter the conversation in the HIV scientific community, informed by the augmentation in intestinal damage due to the joint insult of HIV infection and use of illicit drugs. (i) We will define in vito the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which mucosal T cell depletion, accompanied by the preferential decrease in IL-17 and IL-22 production, antiretroviral drug toxicity, morphogenetic patterning (by the Wnt, Notch, and hedgehog pathways), enterocyte apoptosis, and lamina propria fibrosis (due to HIV infection) and intestinal ischemic damage (due to drug use) combine to increase intestinal permeability (IP) via a loss in epithelial integrity and homeostasis. (ii) Working in vivo in the SIV primate model, we will test directly the ability of exogenous IL-17 and IL-22 to decrease intestinal permeability, reduce systemic inflammation, and possibly alter the disease course. Finally, (iii) we will test our hypothesis that focusing on epithelial repair is a transformative approach to HIV- and illicit drug-promoted mucosal damage, by initiating a pilot clinical study with human Growth Hormone (hGH) as the therapeutic and a reduction of intestinal permeability, a decline in circulating microbial products, and a decrease in biomarkers of hypercoagulability and inflammation, as the clinical endpoints. We hope to establish a new paradigm in which we expect to identify novel therapeutic strategies to heal the breached epithelium, and subsequently stem the translocation of microbial products, minimize systemic inflammation, and treat the HIV-infected drug user."
"9615510","PROJECT SUMMARY Mechanisms underlying the origin and maintenance of adult form, and naturally occurring variation in adult form, remain poorly understood. The research program described here seeks to elucidate how gene activities are translated through cellular behaviors into speci?c morphological outcomes at adult stages. Such knowl- edge will provide insights into essential aspects of post-embryonic patterning and morphogenesis. It will also have impacts relevant to human health in the realms of congenital deformity, aging, cancer and regenerative medicine. This program focuses on adult pigmentation of zebra?sh and its relatives. Pigment cell lineages in vertebrates originate in the embryonic neural crest and depend on precise mechanisms to segregate fate and regulate differentiation in a context of extensive morphogenesis, and particularly migration. Besides sharing these features with other neural crest derivatives, adult pigment cells are interesting because they organize into a diverse array of naturally occurring patterns; because they arise from latent progenitors?and so can provide insights into stem cells biology more generally; and because these lineages give rise to melanoma, representing a profound failure of adult homeostasis and growth control with deadly consequences. The work proposed here will build on our prior efforts that identi?ed distinct lineages of pigment cells having distinct ge- netic and endocrine requirements, as well as our discovery of several types of interactions among pigment cell classes that are needed to establish, implement, and maintain species-speci?c forms of adult pattern. Our goals in the coming years are to elucidate: (i) genetic and cellular mechanisms of pigment cell interactions and differential dependencies on thyroid hormone during adult stripe development in zebra?sh; (ii) the ways in which pigment cell lineages, and particularly latent stem cells, are regulated during adult homeostasis, and how defects in these processes contribute to melanoma susceptibility and progression; and (iii) how previously unstudied pigment cell fates are regulated, and pigment cells organized, to generate species-speci?c pattern variants. Towards these ends we will use a suite of approaches, including state of the art imaging and modern methods of interrogating gene activities, and we will exploit not only stripes of zebra?sh but also the pattern diversity of close zebra?sh relatives, to which the same methods are readily applied. Together our efforts will provide novel insights into the genetic and cellular bases for adult forms of this neural crest derived trait, with implications both basic and translational. !1"
"9421553","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 26 million people in the U.S. have chronic kidney diseases, most commonly from diabetic glomerular injury. However, progression to end stage is more tightly coupled to proximal tubule disappearance (tubular atrophy), which is caused by apoptosis. In the previous funding period we determined that intracellular accumulation of a non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) metabolite, long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (LC-CoA), stimulates tubular atrophy by a mechanism that involves inhibition of NHE1 Na+/H+ exchanger-dependent cell survival. Excess LC-CoAs are stored as cytoplasmic lipid droplets to shield cells from lipotoxicity, though this NEFA buffering capacity is limited in the proximal tubule. Multiple factors converge to cause NEFA accumulation in diabetic nephropathy, but most notably reabsorption of filtered albumin bound to NEFA.  We hypothesize that luminal NEFA uptake by fatty acid transporter-2 (FATP2) causes proximal tubule lipoapoptosis, which contributes to tubular atrophy and progression of diabetic nephropathy. The hypothesis will be pursued with the following specific aims: (1) To determine whether FATP2 is the major transporter for luminal proximal tubule NEFA uptake, fluorescently labeled NEFA uptake will be measured in isolated perfused proximal tubules from FATP2-deficient mice, and apoptosis will be assayed in cultured proximal tubule cells treated with shRNAs directed against FATP2; (2) To determine the pathophysiological relevance of FATP2- mediated NEFA internalization in diabetic nephropathy 13C-labeled NEFA uptake will be assayed in vivo in eNOS-/-db/db mice prone to diabetic nephropathy, and the effects of insulin on FATP2-dependent NEFA uptake in proximal tubule cells will be measured; (3) Genetic and pharmacologic tools will be employed to test whether proximal tubule NEFA uptake regulates diabetic nephropathy progression in eNOS-/-db/db mice. Upon completion of these experiments we are hopeful that FATP2 will emerge as a druggable target for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy."
"9431821","Project summary/Abstract While cure rates for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved dramatically over the last several decades, ALL remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death in children. There continues to be an unmet need for effective therapies for patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), particularly those with relapsed or refractory disease. T-ALL is a disease generally responsive to drugs targeting metabolism, including methotrexate and asparaginase, which form the backbone of T-ALL therapy. Thus, I hypothesize that novel approaches to targeting metabolism may be particularly relevant in T-ALL. I screened a panel of leukemia cell lines against small-molecule inhibitors of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), enzymes of the mitochondrial one carbon folate pathway, and I discovered that T-ALL cells are highly sensitive to these inhibitors, more so than other leukemia cell lines. This proposal aims to use the small molecule inhibitors of MTHFD2 and SHMT2, as well as genetic suppression of these enzymes, in vitro and in vivo, to study the mechanistic role of SHMT2 and MTHFD2 in T-ALL pathogenesis. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop novel therapies for patients with T-ALL. I am a pediatric oncologist who is seeking K08 support for mentored time in Dr. Kimberly Stegmaier's laboratory at DFCI, with Dr. Matthew Vander Heiden at MIT as a co-mentor. My long-term career goal is to become an independent academic physician-scientist, using genomic and chemical approaches to identify metabolic vulnerabilities in acute leukemia with an eye toward therapeutic intervention. My prior research experiences have established my skills in functional genomics, molecular and cellular biology and drug testing applied to acute myeloid leukemia and T-ALL. I am now well positioned to establish the necessary expertise in cancer metabolism, translational medicine and developmental therapeutics through the critical mentored K08 award. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI)/Boston Children's Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard are internationally recognized research programs with a number of expert researchers in the areas of hematopoiesis, metabolism and cancer cell biology, among others. The DFCI Division of Pediatric Oncology has a distinguished record of training young physician- scientists for leadership roles in pediatric cancer research. I have assembled an excellent mentoring and advisory committee, consisting of Dr. Nika Danial, Dr. Jon Aster, and Dr. Lewis Silverman, who will guide my research and training experiences. With the structured mentoring, educational, and research plans, I will acquire the necessary expertise to become a successful independent investigator in translational cancer metabolism."
"9470535","PROJECT SUMMARY Changes to the extracellular matrix (ECM) help direct the inflammatory response to tissue injury and resolution of inflammation. During inflammation, TNF-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) covalently modifies the ECM polysaccharide hyaluronic acid (HA) with the heavy chains (HCs) from the serum protein inter-alpha-inhibitor (I?I). This cross-linking of HA is exclusively carried out by TSG-6 and only occurs during tissue injury, where inflammatory mediators are present to induce TSG-6 secretion and leaky vessels allow serum I?I to enter tissue. While HA cross-linking is present in histopathological lesions of various chronic lung diseases, the presence and role of TSG-6 mediated cross-linking in acute lung injury remains undefined. This proposal will establish for the first time the role of HA cross-linking in directing leukocyte recruitment and delaying resolution during acute lung inflammation. The clinically relevant murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) induced acute lung injury and repair will be used to test the hypothesis that TSG-6 mediated HA cross-linking mediates the recruitment of pro-inflammatory macrophages to the airway (Aim 1) and prolongs inflammation (Aim 2). In Aim 1, we will utilize mice deficient for TSG-6 and I?I as well as TSG-6 supplementation in I?I mice to specifically determine the role of TSG-6 mediated HA cross-linking in the recruitment of pro-inflammatory macrophages. In Aim 2, we will utilize TSG-6 loss of function approaches (TSG-6 null mice and neutralization antibody) to determine the effect of inhibiting TSG-6 on the rate of epithelial repair following PA infection. Completion of these aims will establish a new understanding of the role of TSG-6 induction in the lung and its evolutionarily conserved modifying of HA during inflammation that may yield new therapeutic strategies for lung repair."
"9418571","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal responds to the research need to develop powerful biomarkers of disease response and the need to better understand current modalities of tuberculosis treatment. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has been declared a global emergency. Treatment outcomes are poor, driven by toxicity and limited efficacy of the 2nd-line antituberculosis drugs. Although there is evidence that both antituberculosis activity and most of the toxicity of the key drugs are related to drug exposure, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships in patients with MDR-TB are poorly characterized. In a cohort of South African patients with MDR-TB, we plan to: 1) use innovative pharmacometric analyses to develop a biomarker model of disease regression based on time-to-positivity in liquid culture of serial sputum samples; 2) describe the population pharmacokinetics of the five drugs constituting the standard treatment regimen in nonlinear mixed effects models; 3) describe the individual susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates to those drugs, and the distribution to of the minimum inhibitory drug concentrations in the population; 4) define the frequency of drug-related side effects; 5) use computational analyses to quantify the individual contributions to efficacy and toxicity of the antituberculosis drugs used in combination. We propose to use in vitro hollow fiber models of tuberculosis (HFM-TB) to determine pharmacokinetic targets for antituberculosis activity and the suppression of resistance. Thus the (PK/PD) parameters associated with optimal efficacy, prevention of ADR and synergy will be investigated for moxifloxacin, pyrazinamide and kanamycin combinations in log-phase growth, semi-dormant and intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and then translated to patients using Monte Carlo simulations. The key PK/PD relationships defined in the clinical study will also be investigated in HFM-TB. Our study will identify doses and drug combinations for the treatment of MDR-TB that are likely to be more efficacious and less toxic than the currently used regimen. Moreover the development of a biomarker model of disease response and computational analytical methodologies will enable more efficient optimization of future regimens."
"9463176","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Uterine fibroids (UFs; leiomyomas) are the most important benign neoplastic threat to women's health worldwide, but disproportionately affect women of color, particularly African American (AA) women, who have a threefold higher incidence rate and relative risk of UFs than Caucasian (CC) women. While the underlying cause for this risk disparity is not fully understood, recent studies implicate hypovitaminosis D as a major contributor. Thus, AA women have a tenfold increased risk of vitamin D deficiency compared to CC women, and as we first reported, UF risk is inversely correlated with 25-hydroxy vitamin D serum levels. Nonetheless, it is not clear whether and how the processes that drive UF formation and determine relative risk are genetically or biochemically linked. In this regard, we and others have identified somatic mutations in the transcriptional Mediator subunit MED12 as the dominant drivers of UFs, accounting for ~70% of tumors. Notably, MED12- mutant UFs are characterized by significant chromosomal loss and rearrangement, suggesting genomic instability as a driving force in tumor progression. Herein, we clarify the molecular basis for mutant MED12- driven genomic instability, and further identify vitamin D3 receptor signaling as a likely suppressor of this process. We show that MED12-mutant UF stem cells (SCs) accumulate high levels of unrepaired DNA double- strand breaks (DSBs) through downregulation of key DNA damage response (DDR) and repair genes. Notably, we find the vitamin D3/receptor axis to be a variable modulator of MED12-regulated DDR gene expression. Thus, we show that reduced vitamin D3/receptor signaling suppresses, while elevated signaling activates, DDR genes downregulated in MED12-mutant UF SCs. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that hypovitaminosis D exacerbates DNA damage accumulation and genomic instability arising in MED12-mutant UFs, leading to enhanced tumor progression and burden. Accordingly, we propose that vitamin D3, through reparation of an impaired DDR will provide therapeutic benefit in MED12-mutant tumors. To test these hypotheses, we will (1) Elucidate the molecular basis of genomic instability in MED12-mutant UFs. We will determine if DSB accumulation in MED12-mutant UF SCs derives from defects in DNA damage-induced checkpoint signaling and repair and/or R-loop-induced replication stress. (2) Investigate the relationship between vitamin D3 and MED12 in UF genome maintenance. We will ask whether and how vitamin D3 signaling strength modulates the DDR defects in MED12-mutant UF SCs, relate this activity to patient race and serum vitamin D levels, and elucidate the mechanism by which the vitamin D3/receptor axis and MED12 coordinately control the DDR network at the genomic and epigenomic levels; (3) Examine the therapeutic potential of vitamin D3 in a preclinical mouse model of human UFs. Using a renal capsule mouse model of human UFs, we will evaluate vitamin D3 and its potent non-hypercalcemic analogs for therapeutic efficacy, safety, and mechanism of action, including impact on tumor DNA damage load and DDR gene networks."
"9553946","PROJECT SUMMARY The filoviruses (family Filoviridae), comprising five ebolaviruses, a cuevavirus, and two Marburg viruses, are negative-strand RNA viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fever with up to 90% human case fatality rate. The 2014?2016 epidemic in Western Africa, caused by the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) species demonstrated the potential for these viruses to cause dire health emergencies of global scope, and highlighted the need for development of therapeutics and vaccines. Sudan virus (SUDV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), and Marburg virus (MARV) have all caused large human outbreaks with high case fatality rates, and thus have similar epidemic potential. In particular, while SUDV, the subject of this proposal caused the 2nd largest filovirus outbreak to date, no therapy or vaccine is currently available. Our product, CM-SV1, is a humanized first-in-class, single dose, monoclonal antibody (mAb) against SUDV for use as both a prophylactic and a therapeutic agent, thus serving the needs of frontline medical staff and infected persons. mAbs represent an attractive therapeutic modality for filoviruses because mAb cocktails or convalescent IgG has been demonstrated to provide post-exposure protection of non-human primates. Furthermore, mAbs are generally well-tolerated and have favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Given the sporadic and unpredictable nature of outbreaks, it would be highly advantageous to have mAb therapies against each of the filoviruses ready for rapid deployment as emergency therapeutics. To date, we have produced CM-SV1 in both HEK293 and N. bethathasmia (tobacco) and have demonstrated efficacy in lethal challenge models in murine and guinea pig models of SUDV infection. The purpose of this proposal is to first determine developability of CM-SV1 and then to develop CM-SV1 to a technology readiness level (TRL) 5 in preparation for investigational new drug (IND) filing. In Phase I, we will engineer the Fc portion CM-SV1 to have improved prophylactic capabilities, produce CM-SV1 in an industry standard for manufacturing (Chinese Hamster ovary cells), determine developability, demonstrate non-inferior efficacy compared to HEK produced CM-SV1 in a murine challenge model, and determine success in engineering enhanced half-life. In Phase II, we will determine non-inferior efficacy compared to HEK produced CM-SV1 in a guinea pig challenge model, determine toxicity, prepare and file a pre-IND application and conduct a Type B meeting with FDA, and finally demonstrate efficacy of CM-SV1 in a non-human primate SUDV lethal challenge model. At the culmination of this program CM-SV1 will be optimized for cGMP manufacture and IND preparation."
"9445731","Abstract Direct reversion of cancers into normal tissues is an ideal strategy for cancer treatment. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel reprogramming method that uses a conceptually unique strategy to reprogram Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells into ?normal? neurons. Reprogramming and oncogenic transformation are stepwise processes that share many similarities. The tumor suppressor p53 is considered today the most important tumor suppressor protein in humans and it suppresses both reprogramming and oncogenic transformation. p53 is often mutations and inactivation in GBMs. Previously we have demonstrated that the depletion of p53 efficiently reprograms human somatic cells into neurons by regulation of a set of transcription factors and found two kinase inhibitors are sufficient to reprogram GBM cells into progenitors and ?normal? neurons under defined culture condition. In vitro and in vivo tumorigenesis assays showed that these induced neurons lose tumorigenicity. Moreover, induced progenitors are sensitive to radiation treatment and ROCK- mTOR inhibitor reprogramming prevents GBM local recurrence in mice. In the proposed project, we will reprogram various p53 deficient GBM cells into progenitors and ?normal? neurons in vitro and in vivo, and develop a novel strategy to combine reprogramming and conventional therapy (radio- and chemo-therapy) to treat GBM. In Aim 1, we will reprogram p53 deficient GBM cells into neurons by targeting mutant and wild-type p53 GBM cells. In Aim 2, we will develop novel reprogramming-based therapy for p53 deficient GBM xenografts in mice. In Aim 3, we will delineate mechanisms of GBM reprogramming. Thus, these studies will allow us to develop a novel reprogramming therapy for GBM treatment, to understand the reprogramming mechanism and to examine feasibility towards clinical trials."
"9412456","Idiosyncratic, drug-induced liver injury (IDILI) causes morbidity and mortality in affected patients and necessitates the withdrawal of otherwise efficacious drugs from the market. There is a need for more effective preclinical screening of drug candidates to avoid developing and marketing drugs with IDILI liability. Although mechanisms underlying IDILI reactions are not fully understood, available evidence suggests that adaptive or innate immune responses are involved. A role for cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) has been proposed. Published studies as well as our preliminary results suggest that drugs that cause IDILI in humans sensitize hepatocytes to killing by this cytokine in vitro. Accordingly, the overall hypothesis to be tested is that the abilities of drugs to sensitize hepatocytes to injurious effects of TNF can classify them according to their potential to cause IDILI. In preliminary studies, we exposed HepG2 cells to noncytotoxic concentrations of 24 drugs having either high or no/low IDILI liability in humans. The cells were coexposed to TNF at a concentration that was by itself noncytotoxic. Almost all of the drugs with IDILI liability became cytotoxic in the presence of TNF. In contrast, drugs without IDILI liability showed no such response. Detailed drug concentration-response curves were generated in the absence and presence of TNF, and curve characteristics (EC50s, maximal responses, etc.) were used singly or in combination as covariates to develop statistical classification models. Several models showed superb ability to classify the 24 drugs according to their IDILI liabilities, some yielding areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of > 0.95, indicating remarkably high sensitivity and specificity. This approach has numerous qualities that make it attractive for screening new drug candidates; however, it requires validation and refinement before it would be acceptable as an assay for IDILI prediction in a preclinical, drug development setting. Accordingly, the aim of this proposal is strictly focused to validate and refine promising statistical classification models for development as assays that predict IDILI potential of drug candidates. We will begin by adapting this in vitro approach to a high throughput format. Next, using a larger set of drugs, detailed concentration-response curves obtained in the absence and presence of TNF will provide covariates for evaluating (ie, validating) the most promising of the statistical classification models that resulted from our preliminary study. Finally, the results will be used to refine the models and to select one or more with extraordinarily high performance. Results from the proposed studies have the potential to lead to a robust yet simple, high-throughput, in vitro assay capable of markedly improving preclinical strategies for identifying drug candidates with IDILI potential."
"9492227","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately one in three new HIV infections occurring outside of sub-Saharan Africa is related to injection drug use. Because this epidemic is primarily driven by the injection of opiates, several countries have initiated methadone maintenance treatment as part of their HIV prevention, treatment, and care strategy. In many of these settings more than 30% of patients entering methadone treatment are HIV+. Most will be on antiretroviral therapies (ART) at some point during their treatment with methadone. Interactions between the two most commonly used ART in the world, nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV), and methadone are well known but poorly characterized in clinical populations. These interactions frequently lead to opiate withdrawal symptoms, patient destabilization, and return to drug use that results in a cascade of poor ART adherence and increased morbidity related to drug use and inconsistent HIV care. Adjustment of methadone dose in the setting of methadone-ART interactions can return the patient to stability. There are no clear data to help a clinician determine the extent to which a methadone dose should be adjusted following methadone-ART interactions. Currently, clinicians must guess on methadone dose adjustments until the desired clinical response is achieved. The overall goal of our work is to The following research proposal focuses on the creation of a population pharmacokinetic model of methadone in a real-world clinical setting with a high prevalence of HIV and use of NVP and EFV. This will be accomplished through two specific aims: 1) Use population pharmacokinetics in a real-world clinical setting to measure differences in methadone exposure (e.g., area under the concentration-time curve, AUC; and relationship between dose and apparent oral clearance, CL/F) between those on NVP or EFV and those not on NVP or EFV, respectively; and 2) Evaluate the influence of selected genetic polymorphisms on methadone pharmacokinetics and methadone-NVP and -EFV interactions."
"9464309","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Drug Design Methodologies - Chris Ho, M.D., Ph.D. This SBIR will develop automated software to accurately estimate drug-target binding affinity and selectivity. This capability is crucial to drug discovery, yet remains elusive in all current design tools. Our technology identifies favorable candidates and distinguishes problematic ones that could exhibit side effects due to weak or non-selective, off-target binding. These compounds cause late phase attrition and the extraordinary costs (>$2B) and time (>10 yrs) needed to develop successful drugs. Lifesaving medications are often shelved due to costs and fear of litigation. By de-risking pipelines, we lower costs, and help companies bring more lifesaving treatments to market. Current tools utilize force fields, which are parameterized sets of equations that simulate chemical behavior, to calculate the free energy of receptor binding. However, they all model electrostatic interactions poorly, using simple point charges and Coulomb?s law, which is inadequate. Instead, we utilize the AMOEBA (Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications) force field developed at Washington University. AMOEBA employs significantly more rigorous models for electrostatics, utilizing polarizable atomic multipoles to represent electrostatic potentials around the molecule. Our preliminary data and published studies have shown that the AMOEBA force field is much more accurate in predicting drug-receptor binding free energies than current force fields. Unfortunately, the published academic protocol for deriving AMOEBA parameters for a desired drug is far too difficult, time consuming, and technical to be commercially viable. As such, our hypothesis is that this procedure can be automated in a software product and executed by non-experts in one person hour (aside from quantum mechanical calculation time) rather than the 40+ person hours currently required by a computational chemist. This is our first specific aim. Our second aim is to develop automated software to then utilize these parameters to calculate binding free energies against the drug?s receptor target. The lower the receptor binding free energy, the higher the binding affinity and potency of the compound. In Phase II we will extend the software?s functionality to optimize drugs by suggesting chemical modifications that will improve binding affinity to their targets. A market size and forecast report by Grand View Research states that the 2017 US molecular modeling and virtual screening software market is about $800M and growing, in spite of current shortcomings. Our primary clients will be drug discovery groups at both pharmaceutical and biotech companies, as our technology is applicable to both small molecules and biologics. Our business model includes commercialization via software licensing, consulting, contract research, and IP evaluation. By developing this tool, we will accelerate drug development pipelines and diminish costs, providing significant benefit to both researchers as well as patients and clinical outcomes."
"9631579","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ?4 allele of the APOE gene (APOE4) is a major genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the question of how APOE4 so profoundly increases AD risk remains unanswered. From its association with not only increased risk for AD, but also with increased risk for Dementia with Lewy Bodies and poor recovery following traumatic brain injury, we can infer that the expression of APOE4 disrupts multiple cellular functions to increase susceptibility to neurodegenerative insult. No approved therapy exists for AD that targets the underlying molecular factors. Thus, a mechanistic understanding of how APOE4 increases disease susceptibility and progression will enable us to define novel therapeutic targets. I propose to use induced- pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to elucidate, in a cell type-specific manner, how APOE4 disrupts specific pathways and proteins. I will also construct predictive computational networks of genes perturbed by APOE4 to complement my mechanistic studies in neural cells and to illuminate the relationships between various APOE4-associated processes.  To identify which cellular pathways APOE4 impacts, I constructed a set of yeast models that exhibit a dose-dependent growth defect specifically when expressing APOE4. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that high-throughput screens in yeast can be used to discover underlying cellular dysfunctions associated with neurodegenerative diseases. These pathways identified in yeast have been validated in patient-derived neurons. Using the genetic tractability of yeast and the conservation of fundamental cellular biology between yeast and humans, I performed a genome-wide overexpression screen to identify modifier genes that robustly rescue the toxicity of APOE4 and indicate pathways disrupted by APOE4. I now propose to examine how these aspects of APOE4 biology manifest in the highly specialized cell types of the human brain.  I will utilize isogenic sets of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines that vary only at the APOE locus to investigate disruptions in specific pathways and processes implicated by my high-throughput screens. I will study these disruptions in iPSC-derived astrocytes, neurons, and in astrocyte-neuron co- cultures. Additionally, to be able to predict how the genes and pathways disrupted by APOE4 relate to each other, I will build computational networks with data from yeast screens, iPSCs, and patient datasets and use them to generate testable hypotheses on the cell type-specific and AD-specific effects of APOE4.  I will work with my mentor, Dr. Li-Huei Tsai, co-mentorship committee, Dr. Angelika Amon, Dr. Judith Frydman, and Dr. Jeff Kelly, and my advisory committee, Dr. Bonnie Berger, Dr. Phillip De Jager, and Dr. David Holtzman to carry out my proposed training plan. The proposed mechanistic studies in iPSC-derived cells and predictive computational tools will complement my past training in yeast genetics, cell biology, and biophysics to provide a strong foundation for an independent research program dedicated to the long-term goal of understanding the molecular dysfunctions that lead to AD."
"9517151","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal responds to PA-15-324, End-of-Life (EOL) and Palliative Needs of Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) with Serious Illnesses, a research priority for the National Institutes of Health. AYAs with cancer account for 70,000 new cancer diagnoses in the United States per year, and cancer is their leading disease-related cause of death. However, the quality of EOL care these patients receive has not been systematically defined or measured. In addition, existing measures of EOL care quality were designed for older adults and inadequately capture AYA patient values; a set of measures to characterize high quality EOL care for AYAs does not exist. The overarching goal of this application is to answer the questions: What is the quality of EOL care for AYAs with cancer? What is a patient-centered definition of high quality EOL care for AYAs facing terminal illness? This application will leverage unique data available through Dana- Farber Cancer Institute and the Cancer Research Network to examine care among 2500 AYA cancer patients who died from 2003-2017 between the ages of 12 and 39, and expand on existing measures by developing a novel set of EOL care quality indicators that reflect the needs of AYAs. The proposed study will: Aim 1: Examine EOL care experiences among AYA patients with cancer. We will (a) establish a cohort of 2500 AYA cancer patients who died between 2003 and 2017 after receiving care at one of our three sites; (b) use electronic health records and in-depth medical record review to evaluate EOL care quality; and (c) evaluate sources of variation in EOL care, including differences between patients aged 12-24 years and those aged 25-39 years at death. Aim 2: Develop a novel set of EOL care quality indicators that reflects the needs of the AYA population. The investigators will (a) conduct in-depth interviews with AYA patients and family members, oncology and hospice nurses, and physicians in oncology and hospice/palliative medicine, to develop a set of candidate quality attributes applicable to AYA patients; (b) use a modified Delphi process among stakeholders to hone in on relevant and priority domains for AYA patients aged 12-24 and 25-39 years; and (c) use results to specify a novel set of AYA EOL care quality indicators using administrative, medical record, and interview data. Aim 3: Evaluate the quality of EOL care using newly developed indicators among recent AYA decedents. Investigators will (a) survey surviving family caregivers and perform additional focused medical record review for 300 recent AYA decedents from the parent cohort to evaluate EOL care quality according to newly developed quality indicators; and (b) compare findings from novel versus established indicators. This study will allow an understanding of the current state of EOL care quality among AYA patients and develop a set of quality indicators that capture AYA patient values for care. This work will enable valid assessment of care quality and rigorous evaluation of interventions to improve AYA EOL care delivery."

"9537245","Project Summary/Abstract - Core and Additional Components Influenza, an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and influenza vaccination are key components of influenza prevention. The effectiveness of influenza vaccine varies from year to year, and it can vary by virus subtype, age group, product type, population characteristics, and antigenic match. Annual assessment of clinical vaccine effectiveness is therefore needed to evaluate the impact of current vaccine recommendations and policies, understand the relationship between antigenic changes in viruses and clinical protection, and prepare for vaccine assessment during a pandemic. Interim, mid-season estimates of vaccine effectiveness are useful for public health agencies and physicians. The first Aim of the project is to estimate the effectiveness of influenza vaccine for preventing medically-attended, laboratory confirmed influenza illness in a defined population cohort of adults and children. Patients who seek outpatient care for acute respiratory illness will be recruited during the influenza season. Patients with cough and illness duration ?7 days will be eligible. After informed consent, nose and throat swabs will be tested for influenza A and B using a nucleic acid amplification test (RT- PCR). Samples will be provided to CDC for antigenic characterization and other tests as appropriate. Influenza immunization status will be determined by a validated immunization registry. Vaccine effectiveness will be calculated using the test negative design where cases include participants with RT-PCR confirmed influenza and controls include study participants with noninfluenza respiratory illness (negative RT-PCR). Data will be provided to CDC for combined analyses with other participating sites, including mid-season data for interim analysis of effectiveness. When possible, separate estimates of vaccine effectiveness will be calculated for different age groups, influenza subtypes, and for different vaccine products. The second Aim is to evaluate the disease burden due to RSV during the last three seasons of the project. Participant samples will be tested for RSV using RT-PCR, and the incidence of medically attended RSV will be estimated. The third Aim is to serve as an emergency response resource for CDC pandemic studies of vaccination and antivirals. This will include pilot studies to prepare for a pandemic."
"9500029","Abstract Traditional strategies of vaccine development suffer from long-term and costly manufacture, and as a result, often fail to respond rapidly to newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. By contrast, messenger RNA (mRNA) is rising as a new technology platform to develop vaccines ?on demand? against viral pathogens, offering attractive advantages such as cell-free production, non-viral delivery, as well as simple, fast and cost- effective manufacture. Further improvement upon mRNA's stability and translation efficiency, understanding of their immune mechanisms, and evaluation of their protective efficacy will facilitate the development of next- generation mRNA vaccine technologies against diverse viral pathogens. Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic, emerging infectious virus posing a continuous threat to public health worldwide. There are currently no MERS vaccines approved for use in humans. MERS-CoV spike (S) protein, particularly its receptor-binding domain (RBD), is an important vaccine target. We have previously shown that MERS-CoV RBD contains a critical neutralizing domain capable of inducing strong cross-neutralizing antibodies and protecting human dipeptidyl peptidase 4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice against MERS-CoV infection with outstanding efficacy. However, production of subunit vaccines and other traditional vaccines has limitations, such as low expression and complex purification. To address these unmet challenges, we propose to rationally design and evaluate novel mRNA vaccines, using MERS-CoV as a model pathogen and MERS-CoV S protein as a target antigen. We hypothesize that with appropriate modification and optimization, MERS-CoV S protein RBD-based mRNA vaccines will demonstrate improved stability, increased translation efficiency, and enhanced immunogenicity in both mouse and non-human primates (NHP) models, with protective efficacy on par with the RBD-based subunit vaccine. The specific aims are to (1) rationally design MERS-CoV mRNA vaccines with improved stability and translation efficiency, (2) carefully optimize mRNA formulations and immunization regimens towards in-vivo evaluation of their immunogenicity and mode of action in wild-type mice, and (3) comprehensively evaluate protective efficacy of MERS-CoV mRNA vaccines and elucidate their protective mechanisms in hDPP4-Tg mice and NHPs. Of note, we will also examine the utility of new technologies such as microfluidics and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of B-cell response in mRNA vaccine development and evaluation. The long-term goal is to develop a safe and effective mRNA vaccine that is able to (1) maintain sufficient quantity and quality suitable for industrial- scale production, and (2) meet the WHO Target Product Profiles for rapid onset of immunity in outbreak settings and long-term protection of people at high ongoing risk of MERS-CoV. Together, the proposed project will shed light on protective mechanisms of mRNA vaccines, and provide much-needed information and guidelines for developing mRNA vaccines against diverse viral pathogens with pandemic potential."

Chicago is one of the major epicenters of the syphilis epidemic and includes the largest contiguous African American population in the United States. We propose to identify and characterize those at greatest risk for incident new and recurrent syphilis infections and better define the patterns of transmission, reinfection and co-infection within the social and sexual networks of a diverse group of MSM (16-39 years of age) who are disproportionately impacted. The study, STI Chicago Epidemiology Network Study (SCENES), will enroll 150 high-risk MSM using a recently developed two-step (2S) network recruitment approach in three of Chicago's highest prevalence neighborhoods and monitor them quarterly for 2 years for incident syphilis and other STIs including HIV. We will collect detailed social and sexual network, and risk behavior data and create a syphilis transmission model that is built upon our existing MSM agent-based HIV transmission model platform to incorporate detailed sexual network dynamics, syphilis treatment and reinfection. We will also work closely with our existing Chicago Department of Public Health programs and outreach clinics in order to coordinate treatment of STIs, determine previous treatment and infection histories, engage clients in care and provision of condoms and PrEP as is our current practice. This proposal will contribute valuable new knowledge about syphilis incidence in the highest prevalence neighborhoods in Chicago, and provide a clear understanding of syphilis mono- and co-infection networks. Sexual network analysis using dynamic exponential random graph models that are embedded within our existing agent-based model platform will provide an opportunity to include future genetic network data and serve as a framework for testing emerging prevention interventions prior to conducting clinical trials or implementing prevention strategies."
"9508072","Abstract In addition to impairment of motor, autonomic and sensory function, severe pain is highly prevalent in patients after spinal cord injury. This project aims to better understand the cortical mechanisms and changes underlying the development of central neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury challenging the assumption that hyperexcitability of neuronal circuits can only be modified by directly blocking excitation or increasing the activity of inhibitory circuits. Our previous work has characterized the onset and maintenance of chronic central neuropathic pain in a mouse model of contusion injury. Our preliminary data also show that sensory cortical activity is initially decreased after a transient spinal cord ischemia followed by hyperactivity paralleling the onset of pain behavior. This hyperactivity and the associated pain behavior can be diminished by optogenetic stimulation of somatosensory cortex early after injury. In addition, we have shown that treadmill training can prevent the development and partially reverse pain-associated behavior in mice. We now aim to characterize in detail changes in somatosensory cortical activity after traumatic spinal cord injury in mice using patch- clamping and in vivo calcium imaging in transgenic mice. We also aim to determine whether modulating cortical activity by somatosensory training can modulate cortical hyperactivity after spinal cord injury and thereby ameliorate neuropathic pain. Thereby, we will advance our understanding of the development and maintenance of chronic pain after spinal cord injury, identify cortical mechanisms underlying the development of chronic pain that can be translated into novel pharmacological and rehabilitative treatments that interfere with homeostatic plasticity for a comprehensive pain management."
"9415734","  There is strong junior investigator interest and senior investigator expertise in cellular transport physiology at Marshall University's School of Medicine (MUSOM). Many of the innumerable health disparities of West Virginia/Central Appalachia (WV/CA) have their roots in widespread obesity, which is epidemic in the region. At the epicenter of these disparities, MUSOM is well positioned to address this. Thus, the overall goal of this new Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) application is to promote cellular transport physiology research in obesity related diseases by the next generation of biomedical investigators and to enhance the necessary infrastructure to accomplish this at the MUSOM. The Appalachian Center for Cellular transport in Obesity Related Disorders (ACCORD) will serve as the academic home for this COBRE. It will leverage existing resources such as the WV IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (WV-INBRE), excellent core facilities, and new institutional resources to train the junior investigators. Every COBRE project is hypothesis-driven; with each addressing a novel cellular transport alteration in a distinct obesity related condition, and each utilizing innovative complementary state of the art experimental approaches. A comprehensive and interactive mentoring plan with attention to the individualized needs of each junior investigator, and outstanding senior investigators as mentors, that is evaluation driven will train the junior investigators to become independent scientists. Novel hands-on mentoring and networking opportunities will further enhance the training of junior investigators. In order to sustain these many training opportunities, while addressing one of the most prevalent diseases, obesity, at the heart of many health disparities in WV/CA and nationwide, new resources (space, funding and faculty positions) have been committed to ACCORD by the institution. In turn, ACCORD, to enhance institutional cellular transport in obesity related disorders biomedical research capacity, will develop new resources as future Cores (e.g. Biostatistics and Study Design and Mentoring and Workforce Development preCores) and provide pilot funding. This ACCORD COBRE proposal is critical for WV/CA, as it focuses on a highly significant and extremely timely research problem. It is innovative because it studies cellular transport abnormalities in obesity related diseases, unique from any other COBRE. Thus, the novel projects of this COBRE will likely identify novel targets that can potentially be modeled as new therapeutics to ameliorate and/or prevent obesity related disorders not only in WV/CA, but across the country."
"9470498","Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with a median overall survival limited to 1 year for advanced disease. A significant fraction of GC is due to aberrant HGF/MET axis signaling, most commonly due to MET receptor gene amplification. However, no effective MET-targeted therapies are currently available, with resistance frequently emerging rapidly, following an initial response. The development of additional, alternative approaches to effectively inhibit MET and other RTKs is therefore a necessity for a cure to be found.  We recently identified a number of novel soluble decoy RTKs isoforms (sdRTKs), generated by an alternative splicing/intronic polyadenylation (IPA) mechanism, which can act as potent natural inhibitors of RTK signaling. We developed an antisense-based method to specifically and effectively induce IPA usage and sdRTKs expression in vitro and in vivo. These compounds identify a new class of drugs that carry the advantage of simultaneously knocking down the pathological targets while introducing natural dominant-negative isoforms, thus greatly increasing their efficacy.  We will apply this antisense-based approach to promote IPA and stimulate the expression of dominant-negative, endogenous soluble decoy MET inhibitory variants (sdMET), normally expressed at low levels. sdMETs encode the extracellular ligand-binding and dimerization domains, but lack the transmembrane and the intracellular kinase domains. We hypothesize that sdMET-inducing compounds suppress HGF/MET signaling by a three fold-mechanism: A) direct removal of full-length MET receptor mRNAs, B) binding and sequestration of MET ligand (HGF), and C) non- productive hetero-dimerization with residual MET receptors. We further posit that, as the resulting products are secreted from targeted cells, they affect signaling in both targeted and neighboring cells alike and interfere with paracrine and autocrine loops, thus wielding an amplified effect. Since the mechanism of action is different from that of current therapies, this strategy should be effective in all tumors that rely on HGF/MET signaling, including relapsing ones. To this end, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Identification and characterization of effective inhibitory sdMET splicing variants. 2) Reprogramming of MET splicing/polyadenylation in gastric cancer cells by antisense-based splicing redirection compounds that induce IPA. 3) Assessment of the therapeutic potential of sdMET-inducing antisense oligonucleotides in multiple gastric cancer models, in vitro and in vivo.  These results will be important for the development of powerful novel investigative tools and therapeutic approaches in any cancer type where the HGF/MET signaling axis plays a determinant role. The findings emerging from this study will be broadly translatable to disease dependent on other RTKs and oncogenes, in gastric cancer and other tumors. Analogous compounds can in fact be similarly designed to directly target other RTKs or other targets responsible for drug-resistance and pathological signaling, or to overcome various mechanisms of resistance."
"9604398","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a desperate need to develop agents that specifically and efficaciously treat NSCLC patients, which represent >80% of all lung cancers and whose 5 year survival rates are only ~15%. In the prior funding period, we discovered that not only were NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) levels elevated 5- to 40-fold in >80% NSCLC tumors vs associated normal tissue, but that catalase levels were inversely expressed comparatively, elevated in normal vs tumor tissue. NQO1, therefore, represents a perfect target to exploit for the therapeutic elimination of NSCLCs. Use of NQO1 'bioactivatable' drugs, such as ß-lapachone (ß-lap) and deoxynyboquinone (DNQ) that generate hydrogen peroxide as a mechanism to hyperactivate PARP1 and selectively kill tumors, are very attractive drugs to enable such a strategy. Previously, we generated nanoparticle micelles that efficaciously delivered ß-lap or ß-lap prodrugs to NSCLCs vs normal tissue, resulting in antitumor responses with significant 'apparent cures' in orthotopic NSCLC and other cancer models. We demonstrated significant radiosensitization of NSCLCs, as well as other solid cancers, via a PARP1 hyperactivation mechanism that allowed use of 6- to 10-fold lowered ß-lap doses in combination with nontoxic doses of ionizing radiation (IR) for curative effects in orthotopic NSCLC xenografts. Understanding the exact mechanism of DNA damage and cell death caused by NQO1 bioactivatable drugs allows the following novel next hypotheses and approaches: We hypothesize that sublethal ß-lap or DNQ87 doses can be used to elicit tumor-selective, NQO1-dependent DNA damage. Inhibition of specific DNA base excision (BER) or double strand break (DSB) repair processes will selectively suppress repair/recovery responses in NQO1+ NSCLC cells, causing synergistic antitumor effects. Tumor-specificity to DNA repair inhibitors will resul in dramatic NAD+/ATP losses and inhibition of glucose metabolism and DNA repair. This theory will be tested by completing the following Specific Aims (SAs): SA1: To elucidate the roles of specific DNA base, single or DSB repair pathways and glucose metabolism in recovery (resistance) of NQO1+ NSCLC cells after sublethal ß-lap or DNQ87 doses (Yrs. 1-5). SA2: To determine the antitumor efficacy of ß-lap- dC3-micelles or HPßCD-DNQ87, with or without DNA repair inhibitors, and/or with or without IR treatments (Yrs. 1- 5). Two distinct viable antitumor approaches will be tested in vitro (Aim 1) and in vivo (Aim 2). The first approach will augment specific DNA lesions that hyperactive PARP1 using nontoxic doses of ß-lap or DNQ87, a novel DNQ derivative developed by us by inhibiting BER or DSB repair. In the second approach, PARP1 will be blocked by clinically-relevant inhibitors that prevent DNA repair and will augment lethality of NQO1 bioactivatable drugs. Both approaches exploit the ability of NQO1 bioactivatable drugs to elicit specific tumor-selective DNA lesions, but should result in two completely different cell death mechanisms: programmed necrosis in the first strategy, while the second should cause classical apoptosis/senescence. In either case, use of NQO1 bioactivatable drugs will lend tumor-selectivity to DNA repair inhibitors, whose efficacy has been limited due to lack of specificity."
"9633233","Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus and transmitted by sand flies, is considered by the WHO to be a neglected tropical disease, affecting about 1.5 million people per year. Approximately 70% of CL cases are reported from six countries, including Iran, where CL is endemic in 17 out of 30 provinces, with over 20,000 cases reported annually; the actual incidence has been estimated to be five times higher. There is no vaccine to prevent this disease. Efforts to control zoonotic CL (ZCL), including application of indoor residual insecticides, poisoning of rodent reservoirs, and use of insecticide-treated curtains and bednets (ITNs) have had limited success. In this 2-year project, we propose a novel field-based strategy aimed at prevention of Leishmania major transmission by the sand fly, P. papatasi, with a focus on the hyper-endemic region of Isfahan Province, Iran. Using the sand fly gut-associated bacterium, E. cloacae dissolvens, which has been isolated from biotic loci of ZCL in Isfahan, we propose to develop a paratransgenic model that may eventually be applied to field control. Initially, E. cloacae will be transformed to express the anti-leishmanial peptides, melittin and histone H2B, which act synergistically in vitro to kill L. major at concentrations as low as 1-3 µM. Engineered E. cloacae will then be delivered to laboratory lines of P. papatasi using a soil-based strategy that targets larval stages; production of the recombinant peptides will be verified in adult flies. Challenge of the adult female flies with L. major is expected to result in parasite-refractory insects. Additional studies, to be conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), will simulate microbial conditions of rodent burrows where P. papatasi breed to establish the infectivity and persistence of the engineered bacteria in flies under conditions that mimic field settings. Final project deliverables will include engineered lines of E. cloacae dissolvens and a laboratory model of paratransgenic P. papatasi that can be further developed for field deployment in Iran and neighboring regions of the Middle East. "
"9447095","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent data indicate that a substantial proportion of adults 65 years of age and older are engaging in unsafe, at-risk drinking, either based on the amount of alcohol they drink or alcohol use combined with other comorbidities or medications. Several brief interventions to address the problem of excessive drinking in the elderly, designed mainly for in-person delivery, most in primary care physicians' offices, have yielded promising results, but these interventions are resource intensive and of limited scalability. And, while additional research has shown that web-based interventions addressing alcohol misuse can be efficacious, these promising interventions have not been specifically developed for, or applied to, the elderly, despite the growing need for interventions for this population who currently comprise over 43 million people. While one may conclude that that older adults are not likely to access an Internet-based site focused on alcohol, data from an open Internet- based alcohol screening and brief intervention found that while younger adults were more likely to access the site, elderly drinkers were significantly more likely to report weekly drinking in excess of recommended limits. Indeed, new research from the PEW Research Center has found that older adults are increasingly using the Internet to find health information. Building on ISA's extensive experience in the development and test of substance abuse prevention and health promotion interventions (including previously developed and tested web-based interventions), the proposed project will develop and test an innovative web-based program - science-based, media-rich, tailored, and easily navigated - designed to reduce at-risk drinking by older adults and the subsequent negative and costly health consequences. To overcome the stigma often associated with alcohol misuse among the elderly, the alcohol misuse prevention will be imbedded within a larger health promotion program designed to improve overall health behaviors related to stress management, healthy eating, and physical activity. Phase I will involve focus groups and the development and feasibility testing of the prototype, along with specific milestones that must met before moving to Phase II. Phase II will involve the full development of the web-based program for older adults followed by a field test of the program, including a randomized controlled trial with older adults. Mather LifeWays, a leader in the development and implementation of innovative programs and services to over 30,000 older adults annually through its residences and community outreach, has enthusiastically agreed to serve as the site for both phases of the project and to work with ISA's Center for Workforce Health to market the completed program."
"9416117","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."
"9466271","Summary Abstract The ultimate goal of this project is the validation of a humanized endothelial monocyte- activating protein II (EMAP II) neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) for progression to clinical evaluation as a novel treatment for patients with influenza-associated lung injury. Infection with influenza virus (IAV) remains a major world-wide health threat to high-risk populations including the young and elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. According to CDC data, influenza accounts for more than 23,000 deaths in US annually due to underlying respiratory and circulatory causes. The efficiency of influenza vaccination and antiviral drugs is compromised by the constant change in circulating viruses and the development of resistance in influenza virus strains. Allinaire Therapeutics, LLC is developing a first-in-class therapy which will not depend on the suppression of virus replication, and will be independent of the circulating influenza strain. Rather, the EMAP II mAb will target the pathogenic components of lung injury, including vascular endothelium apoptosis and leakage. We hypothesize that EMAP II is a key underlying factor in IAV-induced lung injury, and that a humanized EMAP II mAb will attenuate the development and serious consequences of lung damage produced by IAV. Here we present preliminary data demonstrating that IAV-induced pathologies are associated with dramatic increases in levels of EMAP II in the lung, and that administration of a rodent EMAP II mAb to influenza-A (IAV) infected mice ameliorates lung injury. Importantly, we have competed the creation of a fully humanized version of the EMAP II mAb - a crucial step towards targeting EMAP II clinically and creating a novel medicine. To evaluate our hypothesis and meet our drug discovery milestones, we plan to validate our humanized EMAP II mAb candidates in vitro in human lung cells exposed to IAV and recombinant EMAP II (Aim 1), and select the most potent and efficacious mAb to be tested in vivo in our established murine model of IAV-induced lung injury (Aim 2)."
"9415470","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Obesity prevention efforts are increasingly focused on early childhood. Emerging evidence suggests that the emotional quality of interactions between parents and children impacts risk for obesity and self-regulation may be an explanatory mechanism. However, parent-child interactions are traditionally observed during play, and mealtime interactions have not been studied over time in relationship to children's obesity risk. Further, which aspects of self-regulation are involved is unclear. Children born preterm have risks for obesity that are similar to children born at term, and preterm children are at higher risk for deficits in self-regulation. The objective of this application is to conduct a longitudinal study of toddlers (of all gestational ages) to determine how the quality of parent-child interactions observed in mealtime and play settings in the home and laboratory impacts changes in weight and adiposity through preschool-age, and to identify the aspects of self-regulation that are involved. Our central hypothesis is that trajectories of parent-child mealtime interaction will differ and predict risk for obesity at 42 months more robustly than observations of parent-child interaction during play, with gestational age and temperamental reactivity as effect modifiers, and emotion regulation as the aspect of self- regulation most strongly associated with obesity. The rationale for the current project is that strategies to prevent obesity in young children are urgently needed and parent engagement will be crucial to their success; studying parent-child interaction over time and across contexts, with children of all gestational ages, will facilitate identification of modifiable targets for obesity prevention. The proposal has three specific aims: 1) to characterize trajectories of parent-child mealtime interactions across the toddler to preschool period relative to parent-child interactions in play, 2) to identify parent-child mealtime interactions that increase risk for obesity, and 3) to determine the aspects of self-regulation that predict healthy weight in preschool-aged children and identify precursors. Our approach to accomplish these aims will be a prospective study of 250 children enrolled at 18 months and assessed at 24, 36, and 42 months of age in our laboratory and in their homes. Parent-child interaction during play and during mealtimes at home and in a standardized buffet lunch in the laboratory will be observed and objectively coded. Self-regulation at preschool-age will be assessed using a battery of objective tasks and parent-report. The expected outcomes of this research will be detailed understanding of the aspects of self-regulation and parent-child mealtime interactions that are associated with risk for obesity in early childhood. The project is innovative in bringing concepts and methods from developmental science to the challenge of childhood obesity and utilizing objective coding of observed parent-child interactions in mealtime and non-mealtime contexts over time and with children of all gestational ages. The project is significant because it will bring a dyadic perspective to research on parenting and childhood obesity and what is learned can be applied to have a positive impact on the health and well-being of children and families."
"9414682","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The kidney contains a multitude of functional units called nephrons that are built during fetal development from a mesenchymal progenitor population. Although stem-like in many aspects, these progenitors differentiate en masse before or shortly after birth. Variability in the timing of this event determines nephron endowment, with low nephron number being correlated with serious health consequences including hypertension, glomerulosclerosis, and chronic kidney disease in adulthood. The mechanisms that lead to the depletion of CM cells remain elusive. Because the progenitors contribute to their own niche we hypothesized that cell intrinsic changes within the CM dictate the collective exit from the niche. To test this hypothesis, we established a new transplantation assay of nephron progenitors to evaluate engraftment of old and young progenitors into the same young niche. We discovered proliferation rates, exit rates, adhesion properties and prolonged niche residence a were inversely correlated with age. Importantly, a few old progenitors remain in the niche for up to 7 days post engraftment, a net gain of 50% to their lifespan, but only if completely surrounded by young neighbors. We will test three hypotheses: (1) changes in Fgf20 (reduced with age) and/or mTor signaling (increased with age) are driving exit from the niche. (2) We will also test the hypothesis that age-dependent epigenetic changes lower the bar for mesenchymal to epithelial transition. (3) We posits that progressive changes in the transcriptome and translatome drive niche exit. We performed unbiased transcriptome profiling of single nephron progenitors and identified distinct age-dependent transcriptional signatures, showing changes in the translation machinery. We propose to complete the analysis by examining the changes in the translatome. The engraftment assay will determine which manipulations of candidate genes delays niche exit. We will use animal models to test of this opens the door to increasing nephron endowment in situ."
"8980947","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     BACKGROUND: In primary care, where the majority of prescribing occurs, only 4% to 21% of patients achieve the optimum benefit from their medications. As experts in drug therapy, clinical pharmacists are well-positioned to improve the quality of medication use in VHA primary care. Under the Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) model, however, a single pharmacist is assigned to more than 5,000 patients and cannot possibly review each patient's medication regimen at each visit. Thus, the effort of PACT pharmacists must be targeted to patients for whom the likelihood of benefit is greatest. THE TRIAGE ALGORITHM FOR PACT PHARMACY SERVICES (TAPPS): TAPPS is a novel health informatics tool that we developed to provide PACT pharmacists with concise real-time clinical reports to facilitate decisions about which patients are most likely to benefit from their services. Our approach is consistent with key PACT principles, where pharmacists contribute to team-based care by directly taking responsibility for patient outcomes, practicing at the top of their license, enhancing access, and leveraging health information technology to increase efficiency. TAPPS may be particularly beneficial for rural veterans, as patients engaged in primary care at rural VHA clinics are nearly 50% less likely to receive clinical pharmacy services than patients in primary care at a VHA medical center. RESEARCH PLAN: Aim 1 will test the utility of TAPPS by independently evaluating its 3 key innovations in 3 separate projects involving real-world primary care patients. Aim 2 will determine TAPPS effectiveness using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design. The study will involve 25 PACT pharmacists across 5 medical centers. All pharmacists will begin in the control condition (no access to TAPPS clinical reports) and randomly selected groups of pharmacists will be switched over to the intervention condition (full access to TAPPS reports) in successive 10-week time blocks, such that all pharmacists will be in the intervention condition by the end of the study. Aim 3 will gather qualitative interviews from PACT pharmacists involved in the stepped wedge trial after they have completed their first 10-week block of TAPPS use, with a repeated interview after their third 10-week block. The goal of these interviews is to assess both positive and negative effects of TAPPS on patient care and identify potential barriers to implementation. If TAPPS is proven effective, our findings will be used to make refinements to the TAPPS system and to design a subsequent national implementation study. IMPLICATIONS: TAPPS has the potential for significant impact on the health of veterans by enabling PACT pharmacists to minimize risk for adverse drug events and seek the full benefit of prescription medications. If proven effective, national implementation of TAPPS could affect all VHA primary care patients, with particular benefits for rural veterans. Our experience with TAPPS also has important implications outside VHA, including how medication therapy management services are delivered to Medicare Part D beneficiaries."
"9190637","Anticipated Impact on Veterans Health Care: Nearly 25% of VA users are diagnosed with diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, end stage renal disease, amputations and a significant cause of hospitalizations for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Mortality rates among veterans with diabetes are twice as high compared to veterans without diabetes. In 2012, diabetes was estimated to cost $176 billion in direct medical and indirect costs. These health and cost implications make the effective management of diabetes a policy priority for healthcare providers and policymakers nationwide. This proposal will move beyond hemoglobin A1c (A1c) control to prevent diabetes complications and assess the role of A1c variability. Project Background: A major focus of diabetes management is glucose control, since persistently elevated A1c levels predict adverse health outcomes including microvascular complications. But lowering A1c to moderately stringent targets (<7%) could increase risks of macrovascular disease or mortality. There are increasing data showing that glucose variability plays a significant role in predicting risk of complications. Longer term variability as reflected in A1c fluctuations over time has been linked to risk of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. We have shown that among Veterans with diabetes, increasing A1c variability over a 3 year period is independently associated with risk of MI, ambulatory care sensitive condition hospitalization, and mortality. We wish to further study this for its potential clinical application by developing and validating a novel clinical measure of A1c variability that is unique to each patient.  Project Objectives: We propose an observational study to (a) construct statistical measures and determine  predictors of A1c variability, (b) develop and validate more intuitive clinical measures of A1c variability (i.e. %  time-in-range), and (c) assess the relationship between these measures of A1c variability and adverse health  outcomes in patients with diabetes. Specific objectives include: Objective 1. Construct statistical measures and determine the predictors of A1c variability. Objective 2. Develop and validate a more intuitive clinical measure of A1c variability defined as A1c time-in- range. We will calculate the percentage of days an individual has an A1c level in the appropriate range, based on clinical parameters and the VA-DoD clinical practice guidelines. Objective 3. Estimate the relationship between A1c variability, % time-in-range, and adverse health outcomes? including micro- and macrovascular complications and mortality. Project Methods: The proposed project is a retrospective observational study of secondary data from patient- level administrative and claims data from VA and Medicare. Utilization and pharmacy files will be used to determine patients diagnosed with diabetes between 2004 and 2015. A three-year baseline period will be used to calculate the individual A1c variability measure of coefficient of variation and a %time in range measure. The %time in range measure will be the percentage of days an individual has an A1c level in the appropriate range based on VA-DoD clinical practice guidelines. Patients will be assigned to the provider that orders the most A1c tests for them during the baseline period and provider A1c variability measures will be calculated. Provider A1c variability will be used as an instrumental variable to predict individual A1c variability, controlling for process quality (Objective 1, 2). Residuals will be captured from the equations estimated in these two objectives for Objective 3 to measure the effect of individual A1c variability on health outcomes. Significant relationships will then be further validated in a VA-Medicaid population."
"9546339","Program Description/Abstract Lineage commitment and maintenance are fundamental processes in a variety of biological systems. In the immune system, dysregulated T cell responses are the cause of many allergic and inflammatory disorders. TH17 cells play a key pathogenic role in Multiple sclerosis (MS) and its murine model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). A unique feature of TH17 cells is their inherent plasticity that endows mature effector TH17 cells with characteristics of other T cell subsets especially TH1 cells, but how this process is controlled and its functional significance remain elusive. Coordination of T cell metabolic programs with cell fate decisions is a fundamental process in adaptive immunity, but how metabolic pathways intersect with immune signals in T cell fate decisions and autoimmune dysregulation is poorly defined. In particular, the function of metabolic programs in effector T cell plasticity and pathogenicity remains essentially unexplored. Our preliminary results identified the key roles of mTORC1 and metabolic pathways in the programming of pathogenic responses in effector TH17 cells. Loss of mTORC1 activity in TH17 cells via the Il17aCre deletion system abrogated neuroinflammation and tissue damage in EAE. Mechanistically, mTORC1 inhibition impaired the ability of TH17 cells to transition into T-bethi IFN?-expressing terminally differentiated cells, associated with altered transcriptional responses and metabolic activities. Unexpectedly, using cutting-edge ATAC-Seq and single cell RNA-Seq technologies, we found that inhibition of mTORC1 induced TCF-1 expression and endowed TH17 cells with stem cell-like features. We hypothesize that the inherent heterogeneity of TH17 cells underlies their lineage plasticity; the balance between terminal differentiation and sustained stemness depends upon mTORC1 signaling and metabolic reprogramming, and contributes to autoimmune inflammation. Aim 1. Determine transcriptional mechanisms and developmental trajectory underlying TH17 terminal differentiation and stemness. Aim 2. Establish the signaling and metabolic mechanisms of mTORC1 in TH17 responses. Aim 3. Establish metabolic control and signaling circuits of TH17 plasticity. There has been little description of molecular pathways regulating TH17 lineage plasticity. We argue that insight into metabolic control of TH17 plasticity could establish a new paradigm of T cell fate control mechanisms, and manifest legitimate therapeutic opportunities for autoimmune diseases."
"9506436","ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem in developing countries. More recently, the prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) has also been increasing worldwide in both developed and developing countries. NTM infection is clinically undistingable from tuberculosis and poses significant challenges in patient management, especialy in patients with chronic pulmonary TB (known to have 18% of NTM infections). The sputum smear, the most widely used diagnostic tool for TB is more than 100 years old, misses to detect half of tuberculosis cases, and is unable to differentiate between mycobacterial species. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Xpert MTB/RIF assay and other molecular tools, however, Xpert MTB/RIF is less sensitive than sputum culture (the current gold standard) and does not address the differential with growing NTM infections. In this application, we propose to leverage the scientific infrastructure and collaboration between the Center for Innovation in Global Health Technologies (CIGHT) at Northwestern University and the SEREFO HIV/TB Laboratory in Mali, at the University of Bamako (USTTB), to evaluate a new highly sensitive Multiplex MTB/NTM assay that can differentiate, at least M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC, TB causative agent) from the treatable and the most common NTM, M. avium complex (MAC). Preliminary data from the new assay suggest a performance superior to Xpert TB/RIF and comparable to sputum culture. The specific aims of this project are to evaluate the assay on fresh sputum samples from 1) patients with chronic TB-like disease, and 2) TB suspect patients with negative sputum smear. The study will evaluate the assay sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for both MTBC and NTM. The development and validation of such tools will significantly contribute into the fight against both TB and NTM diseases worldwide. Finally, the project assembled an excellent and complementary team to ensure the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project."
"9617532","Microglia serve as resident immune cells in the brain and are considered key contributors to neuroinflammation, a process that has been implicated in the negative, long-term effects of alcohol on the central nervous system (CNS). The molecular mechanisms underlying activation and related phenotypic transitions of microglia during ethanol exposure are unclear. Based on a recent proteomic analysis of ethanol- treated microglia, we can demonstrate that a significant portion of the ethanol-induced proteome response in microglia could be attributed to changes in the activity of KDM5B, a histone demethylase that catalyzes the removal of tri-methylation on Lys 4 of Histone H3 (H3K4me3). Moreover, we have strong preliminary data that show ethanol induces histone methylation changes both in vitro and in vivo and that experimental modulation of KDM5B activity affects the pro-inflammatory response of microglia. Therefore, we hypothesize that methylation is an important epigenetic modification that influences ethanol-induced activation of microglia resulting in unique functional outcomes that have immediate and possible transgenerational effects on the brain. In order to test our hypothesis, we plan to 1) characterize ethanol-induced changes in the microglial histone methylation code mediated by KDM5B in both primary pure microglia cultures and neuron-microglia co- cultures, 2) determine ethanol dose- and time-dependent role of KDM5B and related histone methylation changes on ethanol-induced microglial activation in vivo and 3) characterize the functional outcome of ethanol- induced epigenetic inheritance of KDM5B-mediated methylation in microglia. The proposed studies incorporate novel approaches such as activity-based protein profiling, methylation-specific quantitative mass spectrometry and ChIP-Seq in order to carry out these aims. This project will be the first ever comprehensive global-scale analysis of methylation and its regulators, which could determine, at least partly, the epigenetic code related to microglial activation phenotype after chronic ethanol exposure in the brain. Characterization of these ethanol- responsive pathways in microglia could also lead to further insight into the development of novel epigenetic therapies for the treatment of CNS dysfunction resulting from alcohol abuse."
"9295960","PROJECT SUMMARY  Bacterial pathogens use diverse strategies to evade host defenses and colonize mammalian tissues. Some bacteria evade aspects of the host immune system, such as neutrophils and antibodies, by hiding inside of macrophages. Macrophages, however, are good bacterial killers in their own right. Therefore, how bacteria withstand macrophage defenses and acquire sufficient nutrients to survive and even replicate remains a key question in infection biology. We intend to close this knowledge gap by developing new tools to probe macrophage-bacterial interactions. Some of these tools could become the basis of antibacterial treatments. We study the Gram-negative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica, which colonizes macrophages in a murine typhoid fever model. We recently developed a quantitative, phenotypic, high content, in- macrophage screen for small molecules that prevent or increase bacterial growth inside of macrophages. Based on our pilot screen, we anticipate identifying a total of approximately 118 small molecules that prevent and 5 that promote S. enterica replication within macrophages. We propose to analyze compound chemical structure, evaluate purity, and establish the Effective Concentration50 and characterize the effect of compounds on infection dynamics and cell morphology using in vivo imaging."
"9162822","Project Summary/Abstract  Hospital related bacterial infections which are generally associated with biofilms are a significant health care problem in the US. Although bacteria that repopulate biofilms are often sensitive to the antibiotics used, biofilms interestingly have a high propensity to relapse. In this phenomenon, after the majority of the cells have been killed upon exposure to antibiotics, a small number of tolerant cells survive the treatment. This subpopulation eventually regains their ability to proliferate after the conclusion of treatment, and forms a cell population that has the same antibiotic sensitivity of the original cell population. Persisters and ?viable but non- culturable? cells (VBNCs) are two phenotypic variants identified so far, which are highly tolerant to antibiotics and the underlying cause of this infection reoccurrence. Unfortunately, many physiological aspects of these phenotypes remain elusive and this significant knowledge gap has hindered the discovery of anti-persister and anti-VBNC therapeutics. The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify the molecular-level characteristics that portray persisters and VBNCs, and explore the methods facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies that eliminate both cell types. In this context, we will first generate a transposon or overexpression library for E. coli and screen for genes whose perturbation would impair both persister and VBNC formation using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and transposon-sequencing. To further map the underlying mechanisms that are relevant to an antibiotic tolerant state, we will determine transcriptome patterns of the strains which have received genetic perturbations eliminating the antibiotic tolerant states. The same methodology will be applied to an opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa to systematically explore its genetic basis of persistence and VBNC state. Altogether, these experiments will provide insights to develop novel approaches to perturb the ability of bacteria to form antibiotic tolerant states. In addition, this study would represent one of the seminal contributions to characterizing and distinguishing persister and VBNC formation mechanisms in P. aeruginosa."
"9477957","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An occupational health and safety surveillance program in Montana would work to accomplish three main goals in order to bridge the gap between occupational health surveillance and prevention and safety activities. This program, Montana Occupational Health and Safety Surveillance (MOHSS), would accomplish this through three primary activities that all together can provide valuable information and lead to occupational health improvement across the state. MOHSS will collect, report, and analyze the NIOSH Occupational Health Indicators as a baseline for occupational health surveillance. The indicators collected on an annual basis will allow for an analysis of trends in occupational health These will be used to monitor Montana's occupational safety and health landscape, reveal areas in need of more in-depth surveillance, and guide prevention efforts. MOHSS will also use interagency collaborations to improve the quantity and quality of occupational health data collected and used for occupational health surveillance. MOHSS will work to improve access to and quality of existing systems as well as explore new data sources. In order to accomplish this, MOHSS will collaborate with other agencies and bureaus within Montana to take advantage of the large variety of surveillance systems already in place. These include the MT Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS), DLI Research and Analysis, and other organizations.  Finally, MOHSS will create and maintain active communication with stakeholders in occupational safety and health to provide avenues through which information from MOHSS can reach agencies able to act in the findings. Findings from MOHSS will guide interventions and preventative policy targeting occupational health and safety hazards most efficiently. These relationships will also provide external guidance to MOHSS and provide council on aspects of occupational health of particular importance or concern."
"9408660","ABSTRACT ? INFORMATICS AND ANALYTICS CORE The Informatics and Analytics Core (IAC) will centralize an enduring data archive and analytic tools that will allow the broader epilepsy research community to identify and validate biomarkers of epileptogenesis in images, electrophysiology, and molecular/serological/tissue studies. Beyond creating a centralized data repository, the IAC will pioneer innovative standardization/co-registration methods, fully supported by novel image and electrophysiology processing methods to extract candidate biomarkers from the diverse data. Not only will a well-curated and standardized multi-modal data set facilitate the development of models of epileptogenesis, it will also ensure that such models are statistically significant and can be validated. Based on our previous experience with similar multicenter projects, we are confident that our infrastructure will lead to success in this project. The amount of data to be collected in these studies is unprecedented: video-EEG from animals after TBI recorded continuously for 6 months, in addition to prolonged continuous ICU EEG recordings from humans and intermittent sampling of brain images, blood, and tissue data. To analyze these data properly, it requires a diverse, accomplished group of investigators spanning neurology, neuroscience, imaging, mathematics, engineering, and computer science, as well as collecting comprehensive data in parallel from humans and animal models after TBI. The IAC will be seamlessly integrated with Projects 1-3, assisting in collecting data and providing analytic tools that will lead to biomarkers of epileptogenesis. By combining new data capabilities and our powerful, best-in-class, interdisciplinary team, quantitative models of epileptogenesis may be possible. These types of models will enrich preclinical trial populations, expedite interventions to prevent epilepsy after brain insults, and document epilepsy before late seizures occur. Based on previous studies, it is likely that there are reproducible changes in biomarkers, which identify the presence of epilepsy before its overt clinical expression61,71,72. The IAC will bring big data techniques and rigorous analysis to longitudinal data collected from humans and animal models of TBI, epilepsy, and their interaction. It will develop and implement new approaches, including novel graphical methods to visualize multivariable interactions, to quantify phenotype and molecular profiles in these disorders. A first-rate bioinformatics platform, LONI, will focus on TBI and epileptogenesis research. The tools, pipelines, and protocols developed for this proposal will be made available to the epilepsy research community, with the potential to change, long-term, the way that images, video, electrophysiology, proteomics, and metadata are analyzed in these fields. Quantitative and data mining methods will enable investigators to record and analyze gold-standard data and create a shared bioinformatics resource for epilepsy research that will live on long after the end of this project. Perhaps most importantly, the IAC will provide the technical sophistication to tease out the interaction between the complex processes studied in Projects 1-3, integrating multi-modal data in a way that has been beyond the capability of a single laboratory or center. The IAC will provide a lasting and open platform for standardized biomarker research in both TBI and epilepsy as well as engage with and guide the projects that, together, will lead to future clinical trial development. !"
"9428750","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Stroke affects over 7.5 million patients in the U.S, with an estimated 795,000 additional cases of stroke occurring each year. Over 30% of stroke survivors have spasticity, a disorder of muscle tone that can cause striking impairments in functional movement. Pharmacological, surgical and physical treatments to manage spasticity have, at best, short-term efficacy and are confounded by side effects. In this NINDS CREATE Device project, we propose translational activities that will advance through multi-site Phase II clinical trials and regulatory submission a recently developed neuromodulation device that non-invasively treats spasticity using a novel approach that combines trans-spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) with simultaneous peripheral nerve stimulation. The implications of the current project are far-reaching changes in clinical practice for treating spasticity using an entirely novel approach based on non-invasive neuromodulation. PathMaker Neurosystems Inc. is a clinical-stage neuromodulation company developing a first-in-class treatment for treating stroke patients with spasticity. Our objective for this NINDS CREATE Device project is to carry out key translational activities that will be essential for advancing this technology through multi-site Phase II clinical trials and regulatory approval as a safe and efficacious new treatment for spasticity. The project consists of 5 Specific Aims: In Specific Aim 1, we will implement a GMP-compliant version of the device (MyoRegulator) for use in a Phase II pivotal clinical study in stroke. In Specific Aim 2, we will implement a compliant Quality Management System (QMS). In Specific Aim 3, we will complete preparations for a Phase II clinical study. In Specific Aim 4, we will complete a multi-site double-blind controlled human clinical study. In Specific Aim 5, we will submit De Novo 510(k) for regulatory approval for MyoRegulator. These Specific Aims will lay the essential groundwork allowing our novel, NIH-funded technology to move rapidly through human clinical trials and to regulatory approval. As our company works to translate the groundbreaking academic studies that have resulted in a novel approach to the treatment of spasticity, NINDS CREATE Device support will advance this breakthrough treatment towards the market and enable an entirely new treatment option for stroke patients with spasticity."
"9617896","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on the physiologic condition of sepsis, which is the tenth leading cause of death in the US with a mortality rate of >215,000 patients a year. For this reason, numerous mono-centric clinical trials (i.e. one therapeutic) have been undertaken, but these trials have shown limited success. As such, a critical need still exists for new therapeutic approaches and treatments for sepsis. Elucidation of new molecular mechanisms controlling inflammation provides the necessary foundation upon which to build. In this regard, an early manifestation of sepsis is the development of an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory lipids such as the arachidonic acid (AA)-derived eicosanoids and 3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived lipid mediators (e.g. eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-derived (e.g. E-resolvins) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)- derived (e.g. D-resolvins)). The synthesis of these lipid mediators begins with the initial rate-limiting step, the formation of AA, EPA, and DHA via the activity of a phospholipase A2 (PLA2). One of the major PLA2s involved in this initial step is group IVA cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2? and the Chalfant laboratory demonstrated that the sphingolipid, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), directly binds and activates cPLA2?ia the cationic ?roove of the C2 domain. To evaluate the physiological relevance of this lipid:protein interaction, we created a knockin mouse with the endogenous C1P interaction site of cPLA2ablated (KI). Intriguingly, our preliminary data showed that KI mice, unlike the wild-type (WT) and cPLA2?nockout (KO) mice, exhibit complete resistance to sepsis including marked reduction in neutrophil infiltration into the peritoneum. Notably, these mice displayed lower levels of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids with concomitant increases in anti-inflammatory resolvins. This novel lipid profile, in contrast to WT and KO mice, correlates strongly with lipid profiles of human patients that recover from sepsis. Mechanistically, the KI mouse also demonstrated differential usage in the phospholipid precursors utilized for DHA and EPA generation suggesting a previously unknown/unsurmised modulating role for C1P in cPLA2function/localization.          Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the sepsis resistance of KI mice and associated differential synthesis of specific pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators: i) will b reflected by a perfect storm of lipid mediator production in human patients who recover from sepsis, which preserves endothelium function by suppressing neutrophil trans-endothelial migration; thereby limiting the hyper-inflammatory stage of sepsis; ii) will reflect a novel lipid class switch in the use of phospholipid substrates involving differential localization of regulatoy and lipid synthetic proteins; and iii) will show specific and direct interaction of the C1P headgroup and sphingoid with cPLA2?pon co-crystallization experiments, which will allow for the future rational design of new therapeutics. We will validate these hypotheses and inferences using a multi-disciplinary approach including cellular, biophysical, structural, biological, and pr-clinical experiments."
"9446310","PROJECT SUMMARY Youth mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, concussion) is a public health problem in the United States. Youth are felt to be particularly at risk for adverse outcomes from additive injury during recovery from mTBI. Thus, a critical aspect of care is determining when a child has recovered from mTBI such that a child can be medically cleared to return to sports and other high risk recreational activities without increased risk for adverse short- or long-term outcomes. While mTBI is defined as a physiological brain injury, current clinical measures for determining medical clearance to return to play after mTBI are not directly tried to brain physiology. The overall goal of this project is to evaluate markers of brain physiology in youth medically cleared to return to play after mTBI and how these markers relate to adverse events over the year following medical clearance. Specifically, we will investigate whether youth who have been medically cleared from mTBI by experts using the current gold-standard of clinical assessments show more subtle motor signs and/or anomalous functional brain connectivity compared to peers who have never had a mTBI and how long these findings persist. We will also evaluate whether motor and imaging findings predict rate of re-injury (musculoskeletal or mTBI) or clinically significant changes in emotional or cognitive functioning or health-related quality of life over the year following medical clearance. The aims of this project are to 1) evaluate whether youth medically cleared after mTBI show more subtle motor signs on a clinically-feasible measure at medical clearance and 3 and 12 months later, 2) evaluate for between-group differences in functional connectivity of resting state (default mode and dorsal attention) networks with premotor and motor brain regions at medical clearance and 3 and 12 months later, 3) determine if subtle motor signs are associated with functional brain connectivity in youth medically cleared after mTBI, and 4) evaluate the relationship between motor and imaging findings and occurrence of adverse events over the year following medical clearance. We will evaluate 70 youth aged 10-17 within 3 weeks of being medically cleared as recovered from mTBI and will re-evaluate the same youth 3 and 12 months later. We will similarly evaluate 70 age- and sex-matched youth who have never had a mTBI at three time points, baseline and 3 and 12 months later. At each time point we will compare groups with respect to motor subtle signs and functional connectivity of the dorsal attention network and default mode network with premotor and primary motor regions in the brain, both at rest and during a motor task. We will evaluate whether anomalous functional connectivity patterns in the mTBI group are associated with the presence of subtle motor signs. Lastly, we evaluate the relationship between motor and imaging findings and occurrence of re-injury or clinically significant change in functioning over the year following medical clearance. This project will help determine the adequacy of current clinical measures for evaluating medical clearance after youth mTBI and will set the stage for devising and evaluating strategies to reduce short- and long-term risks related to youth mTBI."
"9510967","Project Summary Chronic rejection is one of the leading causes of graft loss following transplantation. It is also one of the most significant and unresolved problems requiring investigation and new therapies. The microvascular endothelium is a critical interface between the donor graft and the recipient. Maintaining quiescent and pro-tolerogenic graft endothelium ameliorates chronic rejection. Studies have shown that blockade of the co-inhibitory pathway and their local effects to promote immunoregulation leads to graft rejection. This may be due to the impairment of Foxp3+ regulatory T cell (Tregs)?mediated graft tolerance. My research proposal focuses on improving graft survival and potentially supporting the induction of tolerance within the graft that will benefit all transplant recipients. We found that the endothelial receptor Tie2 and its ligands Angiopoietins (Angpt1/2) maintain the integrity and immunogenicity of endothelial cells. Administration of Angpt1, an activator of Tie2 pathway, and blocking of deactivator ligand Angpt2, (which is otherwise associated with chronic rejection), enhances graft survival and function. We hypothesize that Tie2-mediated signals regulate endothelial PD-L1, and novel PD-L1 agonists will facilitate a tolerogenic intragraft microenvironment that will foster long-term graft survival and local immunoregulation. I will test this hypothesis by two specific aims: 1) To determine Tie2 mediated regulation of PD-L1 and 2) To identify small molecules that regulate PD-L1 expression. We will use endothelial cells that differentially express Tie2. In these studies we will evaluate the Tie2 mediated regulations of different immunoregulatory genes including PD-L1. Luciferase-based assay and high content robotic microscopy workstations will be used to identify PD-L1 agonists in drug libraries. This application for an R03 is intended to allow us to understand the regulation of endothelial PD-L1 and discover novel endothelial PD-L1 agonists by using High Throughput Screening (HTS). At the end of the project, we will be able to identify several agonists of endothelial PD-L1,that will be tested further for biological activity."
"9469517","Project Summary The fabrication of complex engineered tissues remains a grand challenge in regenerative medicine. These complex tissues ? bone, cartilage, vasculature, and cardiac ? are characterized by dense cellularity, patterned cellular composition, and controlled matrix presentation. The proposed Biomedical Technology Resource Center (BTRC) will address this critical need by applying three-dimensional printing (3DP) strategies to the engineering of complex tissues. This BTRC brings together research leaders at the University of Maryland, Rice University, and Wake Forest University, all highly regarded collaborators in the field, to lead the development of the Center for Engineering Complex Tissues (CECT, [sees-t]). Strong and effective administrative leadership will maximize productivity, enhance ongoing collaborations, and ensure sound fiscal and compliance management for this BTRC. The technical components of CECT consist of 3 Technology Research and Development Projects (TR&Ds), 6 Collaborative Projects (CPs), and 6 Service Projects (SPs). An External Advisory Committee (EAC), that will guide and advise the strategic direction of the Center, will be assembled from world-renowned researchers with biomedical expertise relevant to the CECT. A Local Executive Committee (LEC) will coordinate the effort across the participating institutions involved in the day-to- day operations of the Center. We will also focus on growing a community engaged in developing and utilizing complex engineered tissues by offering a series of programs to help develop and establish these technologies. Communications programs will also be developed for the dissemination of the Center?s activities to enable a broader use of the technologies. The long-term plan for the CECT is that it will become a national hub for transforming current 3DP and tissue engineering technologies into new and improved platforms for everyday uses in regenerative medicine and biomedical device development."
"9352667","Veteran suicides, attempts and suicidal ideation (SI) remain of urgent concern to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Recent reports indicate that approximately half of veteran suicides take place within 1 month of the decedent?s final VHA encounter, with one quarter occurring within 1 week. This provides a temporal window of opportunity to intervene, and necessitates development of a rapid-acting treatment for veterans with SI. Intravenous ketamine is the prototypical anti-suicidal drug, that rapidly reduces SI in some patients. However, there are concerns regarding ketamine?s toxicity in both veterans, and military personnel. These include ketamine?s potential for toxicity and misuse, and the brief duration of anti-suicidal effect. The ideal VHA anti-suicidal treatment: 1) Could be administered orally rather than intravenously; 2) Would achieve ?target engagement? with the same neural substrates as ketamine; 3) Would have fewer risks; and 4) Would have a longer duration of action and/or a more durable antisuicidal effect. Therefore this study will test the novel intervention uridine as a rapid-acting oral treatment for veterans with SI. As described in the proposal, uridine?s potential to fill this role lies in the broad overlap in the brain mechanisms and neural effects shared by uridine, ketamine and the anti-suicidal drug lithium. The reason for this surprising commonality may lie in the fact that ketamine?s mechanism-of-action dependent on activation of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis ? and the fact that uridine is the endogenous circulating pyrimidine in man. To initiate testing of uridine for veterans with SI, we will conduct a four-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of uridine 2000 mg daily for veterans with SI. To make the study more informative, translational neuroimaging is integrated into the protocol to identify biomarkers of SI. Veterans will undergo proton-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) imaging at baseline, with scans repeated after 1 week of treatment, in pursuit of a neurochemical biosignature of rapid SI reduction. Upon completion of the four-week placebo-controlled phase, participants will enter the six-month open-label phase of the study. The open-label phase will accomplish two goals: 1) To evaluate the durability of uridine?s anti-suicidal effect in uridine responders; and 2) To ensure that veterans initially randomized to placebo have a full and fair opportunity to benefit from active treatment. In summary, while piloting a much-needed alternative to intravenous ketamine for suicidal veterans, this research also aims to participate in establishing the neurochemical biomarkers of suicidal ideation, and treatment response."
"9427363","Project Summary Clinical management of obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) relies heavily of drugs that are either agonist or antagonists of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This is because GPCRs control important airway cell functions (contraction, growth, cytokine/chemokine production, chemotaxis, and permeability) that become dysregulated in disease. Unfortunately, these drugs have limitations with respect to both efficacy and safety, and many patients experience suboptimal control. We propose to identify new, more effective ligands that target the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3 mAChR) as a potential COPD therapy, by embracing the emerging concept of biased agonism pharmacology. Biased agonism pharmacology is based on the discovery that GPCRs can assume multiple conformations that transduce qualitatively different signals, and ligands can ?tune? GPCRs to bias signaling to one pathway or another. We propose to discern qualitative signaling properties of the M3 mAChR and determine how canonical (G protein-dependent) versus non-canonical (arrestin-dependent) signaling regulates airway smooth muscle (ASM) functions that are often dysregulated in COPD. We have discovered both small molecule orthosteric ligands as well as a peptide that can bias M3 mAChR signaling toward the arrestin signaling pathway. Preliminary data also strongly suggest arrestin-dependent signaling mediates therapeutically beneficial ASM functions. Lead agents in hand as well as those that emerge in focused screens will be tested in cell- and tissue-based studies of ASM signaling and function, and ultimately in an in vivo model of COPD to discern the utility of these drugs as COPD therapeutics. Three Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will employ genetic and molecular strategies, including use of mice with arrestin subtype genes ablated, to establish the regulatory effects of arrestins on M3 mAChR-mediated functions (contraction, growth, and synthetic functions) in airway smooth muscle. Aim 2 will employ semi-high throughput screening systems, ASM signaling and functional assays, and novel engineered M3 receptors to fully characterize those biased agents in hand and to discover additional biased ligands and peptides. Aim 3 will test our lead biased M3 ligands in an in vivo model of COPD to verify the ability of a biased pharmacology approach to manage the disease. The impact of the proposed studies lies in their ability to significantly advance the science underlying, and ultimate clinical application of, biased agonism pharmacology."
"9644253","The concept of the pathogenesis of asthma has evolved from the 1960s viewpoint of asthma as being a disorder having a primary defect in lung smooth muscle requiring treatment with beta agonists, to the current paradigm of asthma being a disease primarily due to airway inflammation. The goal of this UCSD AADCRC U19 program is to challenge the current paradigm that asthma is solely a disease of airway inflammation which induces structural changes in the airway, by proposing that asthma is a disease of both lung structural cells (smooth muscle) as well as airway inflammation (in particular controlled by T cells and ILC2) and that developing therapeutic strategies to target both airway structural cells and immune/inflammatory cells is needed to control severe asthma with airway remodeling. In this regard, atopic dermatitis, is a good example of a disease that is part of the atopic march to asthma which is characterized not only by skin inflammation, but also in a subset by a genetic defect in a skin structural gene filaggrin. Similarly, we hypothesize that there are lung structural gene defects in asthma that predispose to airway remodeling in asthma. In support of this hypothesis preliminary data in Project 1 (Broide) provides evidence that ORMDL3, a gene highly linked to childhood asthma and severe asthma, when expressed in smooth muscle contributes to smooth muscle remodeling in the absence of an exogenous inflammatory stimulus. Thus, the goal of the program is to demonstrate that airway remodeling in asthma may be mediated by a combination of pathways intrinsic to structural cells in the lung (e.g. ORMDL3 expressed in smooth muscle)(Broide, Project 1), interacting with exogenous immune (T cells) and inflammatory (ILC2/macrophage) pathways to induce smooth muscle, fibroblast and epithelial remodeling. In this regard, our preliminary data demonstrates that LIGHT and TL1A (derived from T cells/macrophages) drives smooth muscle, fibroblast and epithelial remodeling (Croft, Project 2), while T cells and ILC2 express CD6 which interacts with ALCAM on smooth muscle to mediate bidirectional signaling activating T cells and ILC2 to proliferate and express pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as smooth muscle to proliferate (Doherty, Project 3). The hypothesis in each project will be tested in human asthma clinical samples (sputum, blood, endobronchial biopsy, as well as post mortem lung and lung lymph nodes) provided by Human Asthma Clinical Core B directed by David Broide (UCSD), and co- investigators Richard Kurten (University of Arkansas) and Qutayba Hamid (McGill University)."
"9644496","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The burden of prostate cancer among Veterans is substantial with over 200,000 survivors and  12,000 new diagnoses annually. Most men live with rather than die from this common disease  making prostate cancer survivorship care especially important. Because of its leadership in  chronic disease care and the proportion of older men served, the Veterans Health  Administration (VHA) is well positioned to become one of the national leaders in prostate cancer  survivorship care. However, the quality of Veteran prostate cancer survivorship care is largely  unknown. In addition, there is poor consensus about whether primary care providers or cancer  specialists should have primary responsibility for ongoing cancer surveillance and management  of treatment-related side effects (e.g., incontinence, osteoporosis). Ultimately, the design and  implementation of tools to optimize prostate cancer survivorship care rests upon understanding  how responsibility for survivorship care is managed and the barriers to good survivorship care.  This research program will improve our understanding of Veteran prostate cancer survivorship  care and seek to improve it using state-of-the-art implementation science methods. This  program has three aims. Aim 1: To examine variation in 2 key quality indicators of prostate  cancer survivorship care. Using national VHA data (2005-2011), we will examine variation in  the quality of prostate cancer survivorship care for cancer surveillance and bone density testing.  Aim 2: To assess barriers and facilitators to delivering high quality prostate cancer  survivorship care. Guided by theory, we will perform focus groups and interviews with primary  care providers and prostate cancer specialists to better understand how to improve survivorship  care. Aim 3: To develop, implement and pilot a theory-based intervention to improve the  quality of prostate cancer survivorship care. We will use our findings to pilot an intervention  that addresses quality gaps in cancer surveillance and bone density testing uncovered in Aim 1,  in preparation for a randomized trial. Due to the expanding population of Veteran prostate  cancer survivors, optimizing their quality of survivorship care is of the utmost importance. Our  findings will inform models for cancer survivorship care across VHA and guide future  implementation efforts to improve the quality of cancer care."
"9448709","Project Description Feeding behavior is influenced by multiple factors including food palatability and nutritional needs. Peripheral chemosensory taste neurons primarily detect palatable food, but animals lacking these taste neurons can still develop a preference to sugars on the basis of their nutritional value. My laboratory previously determined that dSLC5A11+, EB R4d neurons in the Drosophila brain are required for the selection of nutritive D- glucose over nonnutritive L-glucose after periods of starvation. dSLC5A11 (or cupcake) acts on approximately 12 pairs of EB R4d neurons to trigger the selection of nutritive sugars, but the mechanism underlying this process is not understood. We previously proposed two possible mechanisms by which EB R4 neurons may mediate the selection of nutritive sugars: (1) by detecting the nutritional value of sugar through direct activation or (2) monitoring the internal energy reserves of the fly with a direct nutrient sensor located elsewhere; starved flies lacking functional EB R4d neurons cannot sense the deprived metabolic state and, thus, would not select nutritive sugars.  Through calcium imaging and a more-sensitive electrophysiology approach, we tested whether EB R4d neurons respond to nutritive sugars, but failed to observe any responses to glucose or any other sugars. Instead, the activity of EB R4d neurons and the expression of dSLC5A11 transcript increase significantly following periods of starvation. Furthermore, the increased dSLC5A11 suppresses dKCNQ currents, thereby increasing the activity of EB R4d neurons during starvation. Recently, we found that EB R4d neurons are robustly activated by serotonin, which is apparently secreted by the neurons labeled by R50H05-GAL4. These R50H05+ neurons were shown to promote food intake, similar to EB R4d neurons. We also found that another population of the EB Ring neurons, apparently the neighboring EB R4m neurons, suppress food intake.  In this renewal application, we propose to study the following questions based on our published and preliminary results. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which EB R4d neurons are activated. We will further elucidate the dSLC5A11/dKCNQ- mediated mechanism, but also investigate the dSLC5A11?independent mechanism in which serotonin plays critical roles in stimulating the activity of EB R4d neurons and the expression of dSLC5A11 transcript. In Aim 2, we will determine whether EB R4d neurons function downstream of R50H05+ neurons. In Aim 3, we will validate that the recently identified EB R4m neurons suppress food intake and characterize the interactions between EB R4m and EB R4d neurons, and between EB R4d or EB R4m neurons, and the sleep-promoting EB R2 neurons."
"9415742","Childhood obesity can be devastating to the growing skeleton because it can accelerate bone elongation and contribute to the development of painful conditions such as limb bowing, joint instability, fractures, and slipped epiphyses. The primary obstacle to successful clinical intervention is lack of knowledge of the underlying cause of obesity-induced growth acceleration. Paradoxically, obese children have low to normal levels of growth hormone and IGF-I, the two major hormones that stimulate growth. IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), which restrict growth by sequestering free IGF-I, are reduced in obesity. Preliminary data suggest that local binding proteins may regulate bone elongation by entrapping IGF-I and limiting its transport into the skeleton. The long- term goal is to elucidate the role of local IGFBPs in regulating bone elongation in skeletal growth plates. The overall objective is to determine how IGFBP reduction leads to growth acceleration in obesity. The central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data and tested under two specific aims using dynamic in vivo multiphoton microscopy and a mouse model of human obesity, is that a decrease in local IGFBPs promotes bone lengthening by allowing more IGF-I transport into growth plates. Specific Aim 1 uses in vivo cartilage imaging and ex vivo protein assays to determine bone elongation rate, IGFBP levels, and amount of IGF-I transport into growth plates of obese and non-obese mice. Specific Aim 2 uses local injections to deliver IGFBPs into one limb of young mice to show if local IGFBPs limit IGF-I transport and elongation rate. The rationale for demonstrating a causative link between local IGFBPs in the skeleton and IGF-I transport into growth plates is to facilitate design of IGFBP-based therapies to regulate skeletal growth and improve bone quality in obese children. This project is innovative by using multiphoton imaging to dynamically assess growth plate transport at the cellular level in vivo. This contribution is significant because it can yield transformative findings that mechanistically link IGFBPs to IGF-I uptake in cartilage and bone elongation rate. Such results could aid the development of IGFBPs as a therapeutic strategy for normalizing bone maturation rate in obese children, thus reducing chronic adult disability."

"9548050","PROJECT SUMMARY HIV persistence in the face of antiretroviral therapy necessitates lifelong treatment of infected individuals. HIV infection persists within a reservoir of CD4+ T cells that harbor latent integrated virus. The HIV reservoir may also reside in other long lived cell types such as macrophages, or may be maintained by HIV ongoing replication in the face of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) due to lowered antiretroviral penetration in some anatomical compartments, or decreased sensitivity to ARVs due to cell-to-cell HIV spread. It is possible that multiple mechanisms of HIV persistence may play a role. Several approaches are being tested to target the HIV reservoir for elimination, including ?shock and kill? strategies, which reinitiate HIV gene expression and specifically eliminate infected cells following viral replication, and gene therapy approaches to excise the HIV genome. In addition, there are emerging strategies that recognize and kill infected cells directly. Absent from these approaches is a comprehensive understanding of the phenotypes and characteristics of the cellular source(s) of the HIV reservoir under antiretroviral therapy (ART). Lymph nodes may serve as a central reservoir for HIV persistence due to their high concentration of lymphocytes, extensive cellular interactions within the lymph node which may allow HIV spread between cells, and limited ARV penetration. Multiple CD4+ T cells subtypes have been proposed be the source of the HIV reservoir, but it is still unclear which cell subtype is most crucial to maintain it, and whether there is inter-patient heterogeneity in reservoir composition which depends on ART regimen or other clinical parameters. Furthermore, the composition of the HIV reservoir in Sub-Saharan Africa has rarely been investigated, despite the massively high prevalence of people living with HIV/AIDS in this region, as well as the extensive rollout of ART in at the epicenter of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and the consequent large and diverse ART suppressed patient population which can be studied to understand HIV persistence. In the proposed study, we aim to quantitatively determine the cell type(s) responsible for HIV production in the lymph nodes of ART-treated patients. We will use a novel approach utilizing single cell RNA-Seq to derive both the transcriptional profile of individual host cells and their intracellular viral transcript levels and viral sequences. This will enable us to deeply characterize which cell type(s) are infected, the number of viral transcripts per cell, and the transcriptional changes associated with infection. We will also determine the HIV reservoir size and composition in the lymph nodes of each ART suppressed individual by the established techniques of detecting HIV DNA copies and using viral outgrowth assays. We will test lymph nodes from a large number of study participants, enabled by a unique combination of very high infection prevalence and state of the art hospital facilities at the study's base in Durban. We will investigate common elements of the HIV reservoir across participants, and characterize reservoir heterogeneity."
"9417788","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT TITLE: Dietary Restriction, GH/IGF-1 and Mechanisms of Cellular Protection and Regeneration ABSTACT: Age is the major risk factor for many morbidities including cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Biogerontology research is well positioned to help prevent or at least delay these diseases by identifying safe strategies to retard aging so that the degree and type of cellular damage does not reach the threshold leading to disease incidence or progression. Here we propose to bring together two biogerontology laboratories from the University of Southern California School of Gerontology and a laboratory from Harvard University to study the molecular mechanisms linking fasting, fasting mimicking diets and protein restriction to reduced nutrient signaling, the stress resistance signaling network, the mitochondrial peptide humanin, and in turn, cellular protection, regeneration, and healthspan. These studies will contribute to the identification of drugs and dietary interventions to treat as well as prevent multiple diseases by acting on the aging process and on multi-system regeneration and rejuvenation. An important advantage of the dietary interventions being tested is that they are periodic and therefore have the potential to match and possibly surpass the beneficial effects of chronic calorie restriction while minimizing the burden of chronic and extreme diets, but also minimizing adverse effects.  This P01 application consists of 3 major projects, an Animal and Biostatistics Core, and an Administrative Core. Our common goals are to: 1) identify and study novel periodic dietary interventions that promote healthspan without causing adverse effects at old ages; 2) study the mechanisms of fasting mimicking diet- and protein restriction-dependent cellular protection, regeneration and rejuvenation with focus on the hematopoietic and nervous systems; 3) understand the link between dietary interventions, growth pathways and humanin to test the hypothesis that this mitochondrial peptide functions as a healthspan mediator and determine whether it can serve as a fasting/protein restriction mimetic; 4) test the hypothesis that endogenous H2S is a key mediator of the protective effects of dietary interventions including fasting, fasting mimicking diets and protein restriction on resistance to ischemic and genotoxic injury to organs and cells, and study the regulation of cysteine gamma lyase-mediated endogenous H2S production by dietary restriction, growth factors and humanin.  The unique background of each PI and the close collaboration between them has generated and will continue to generate new hypotheses, novel cellular and mouse models, as well as technical and conceptual developments. These advances will undoubtedly accelerate the research progress and support the development of clinical trials to improve human health in ways that could not be achieved by each laboratory performing research independently."
"9405864","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The liver plays a vital role in maintaining blood glucose levels, in part, through gluconeogenic processes. Gluconeogenesis is an energy costly process that is supported through fat oxidation in hepatic mitochondria. The TCA cycle serves as a hub where acetyl-CoA from the break down of fatty acids and carbohydrates meet for oxidation to CO2 and the production of 3 NADH and 1 FADH2. Not only does the TCA cycle support gluconeogenesis through the formation of reducing equivalents that fuel the electron transport chain, but it also provides gluconeogenic substrates through cataplerotic processes. Changes in substrate concentration and redox state modulate TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes. However, the mechanisms regulating this metabolic response remain to be elucidated. In pathological conditions such as obesity and insulin resistance, TCA cycle flux and gluconeogenesis are elevated, contributing to the inappropriately high endogenous glucose production often observed in insulin resistant individuals. Still, it is no known how the TCA cycle is regulated in this diseased state. Many metabolic processes are sensitive to the energy state, and energy sensors, such as AMPK and Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) may be responsible for coordinating the response of these metabolic processes to changes in energy charge. AMPK is an energy sensor that is activated in response to high AMP:ATP ratios. In response, AMPK stimulates catabolic processes, such as fatty acid oxidation to replenish ATP. Specific Aim 1 will use ex vivo and in vivo experiments, with and without the regulatory capacity of AMPK to determine whether AMPK is responsible for changes in TCA cycle flux and cataplerotic/anaplerotic processes in response to changes in substrate concentration (ex vivo), or in an obese, insulin resistant state (in vivo). It is hypothesized that AMPK will be necessary for increases in TCA cycle flux in response to increases in substrate concentrations and that TCA cycle flux and anaperotic/cataplerotic processes will be elevated in AMPK-KO mice in response to 16 week HFD, but that constitutively active AMPK will restore the flux of these processes. SIRT3 is a mitochondrial deactylase that is activated by changes in the redox state (high NAD+/NADH) and responds by deacetylating mitochondrial proteins involved in metabolic processes. Specific Aim 2 will examine whether SIRT3 regulates the response of TCA cycle flux and cataplerotic/anaplerotic processes to changes in redox state (ex vivo) and in the obese insulin resistant state (in vivo). I hypothesize that SIRT3 will be required for normal TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes. The findings from this research will expand our knowledge of the role of energy sensors, and the function of TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes in both healthy and diseased states. These results may provide future targets for pharmaceutical companies to treat or prevent NAFLD and/or insulin resistance."
"9437317","Abstract/Project Summary The overall goal of seeking a K Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to be a leading independent investigator in implementing interventions through web- and mobile-based technologies that address health disparities associated with diabetes and related diseases. Key objectives of the career development plan are to 1) gain experience with diabetes self-management; 2) gain experience with web-based technology and chronic disease; and 3) gain hands-on experience with the implementation and dissemination of interventions. The following is a description of the proposed research project: Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to macrovascular and microvascular health complications. African Americans have a greater burden of disease, worse health outcomes from diabetes and lower adherence to diabetes self-management goals. Novel approaches to delivering problem-solving skills training that improve diabetes self-management and CVD knowledge are needed. Decision-Making Education for Choices in Diabetes Every Day (DECIDE) (Hill-Briggs) is a problem-solving curriculum that is successful in improving adherence to self-management behaviors in African Americans. However, one limitation of DECIDE is the face to face application. Previous interventions which focus only on problem-solving do not involve the use of web-based technology. The proposed study will explore the translation of DECIDE into an effective web-based program (eDECIDE) for African American patients with uncontrolled diabetes. We hypothesize that eDECIDE can effectively be delivered. We will explore this through three AIMS: 1) To translate and design the DECIDE curriculum into a user-centered web-based program, eDECIDE; 2) To assess patient usability and satisfaction with eDECIDE design; 3) To test eDECIDE in a pilot 9-week randomized controlled trial (n=70), measuring change in HbA1c (primary outcome) and the following secondary outcomes: blood pressure, cholesterol, problem-solving skills, Diabetes and CVD Knowledge, Nutrition, and Diabetes Self-Care behaviors. To investigate our aims we will conduct a task analysis of the DECIDE curriculum, (wireframe architecture) followed by usability testing (website evaluation) and finally conduct a pilot, 9-week randomized controlled trial of eDECIDE. Relevance: Findings from the proposed application have potential to shed light on ways to improve HbA1c and enhance delivery of problem-solving skills training to improve diabetes self-management behaviors among African American populations."
"9538074","Abstract: The attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) on 9/11/2001 (9/11) involved collision of two aircraft into the buildings and the combustion of many thousands of pounds of jet fuel. The subsequent collapse on the towers, and the rescue/recovery effort that followed, led to large numbers of responders being exposed to a wide variety of hazardous material including pulverized cement, glass, asbestos, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated furans and dioxins (1-3). Three research centers that follow cohorts of rescue and recovery workers since the WTC disaster include the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY); the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS); and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). Modest though mostly non-statistically significantly elevated cancer rates post-exposure to the WTC-site have been reported in all three of the cohorts, despite limited follow-up time since 9/11/2001 (4-7). We propose to combine these three cohorts to account for individuals who are in more than one cohort, to increase the sample size, and to make the results more generalizable. We plan to update the incidence findings from the prior reports using consistent exposure and outcome definitions and taking advantage of the additional six years of follow-up since those publications. We also plan to study the time elapsed from WTC- exposure to increased incidence of WTC-associated cancer. We believe that this short-term high intensity exposure with long-term follow-up in responder cohorts, combined for these analyses, offers a rare opportunity to investigate cancer latency in humans. Finally, we also propose the first study of cancer survival in WTC rescue/recovery workers with cancer."
"9462534","Preterm birth, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction are major causes of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. There is increasing evidence that dysregulation of placental function is associated with these disorders, and that the pathologic processes leading to them long precede their clinical manifestations. Therefore, the ability to accurately, rapidly, and safely detect various forms of placental dysfunction early in pregnancy may enable discovery and clinical use of novel biomarkers of pregnancy complications. Currently available strategies for prediction of these adverse pregnancy outcomes suffer from low sensitivity and specificity and/or are unfeasible for broad implementation, due to the need for expensive equipment, specialized expertise, or long turnaround times. This project aims to develop a magnetic nanosensor-based platform for measurement of analytes in the maternal blood that reflect placental function, which can be used to discover novel predictive biomarkers and make them universally available. The project team includes the expertise in maternal fetal medicine (Dr. Laurent), biomarker discovery (Drs. Laurent and Boniface), assay design (Drs. Lo and Boniface), and biosensors and instrument design (Drs. Hall and Lo). Aim 1 will focus on development of a magnetic immunoassays (MIAs) targeting known biomarkers of placental function (PAPP-A, ?HCG, AFP, INHA, sFLT and PLGF) and two novel analytes from a clinical mass-spectrometry-based assay for prediction of spontaneous preterm birth developed by Sera Prognostics (IGFBP4 and SHBG), and validation of these MIAs against existing clinical ELISA- and mass spectrometry-based tests. Aim 2 will include development, testing, and validation of magnetic nanosensor-based miRNA assays (MamiRAs), which will be adapted from a highly sensitive and specific optical PCR-free miRNA assay developed by the Lo group. Replacing the fluorescent quantum dots in the optical assay with magnetic nanoparticles will enable the MamiRAs to be read on the same device as the MIAs for proteins. After initial proof-of-concept studies, we will develop MamiRAs that interrogate a novel set of 21 miRNAs in maternal serum that Dr. Laurent has found to be highly predictive of placental dysfunction. If successful, this project will produce a versatile magnetic nanosensor-based platform for sensitive and specific quantification of a variety of analyte types, which will not only enable development of novel strategies for management and treatment of pregnancy complications, but can also be applied to other clinical and biological systems. Moreover, the platform is amenable to miniaturization, which will enable clinical tests to be performed at the point-of-care, allowing the treating physician to have immediate access to the test results, and enabling testing, interpretation and management/treatment recommendations to be done at the same clinic visit. The ability to test and treat in the same visit will improve the efficiency of the system and eliminate the risk of delayed treatment or loss-to-followup."
"9591803","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) arise from retroviruses chromosomally integrated in the host germline. The pervasive infiltration of ERVs in genomes represents an important source of genetic variation across and within species. ERVs are highly abundant in vertebrate genomes, accounting for 8% of the human DNA. However, surprisingly little is known about the functional impact of this important class of mobile elements on the physiology and evolution of their hosts. ERVs can cause specific pathologies in animals, including cancer, but their association with human disease remains controversial, despite half a century of investigation. Even less understood are the potential beneficial functions ERVs confer on their host cells. This project is designed to yield transformative insights into the biological significance of ERVs in evolution and disease. The central and innovative idea of this proposal is that the perpetual genetic conflict between hosts and pathogens has led to the invention and diversification of molecular arsenals, which in turn promote the co-option of endogenous viruses for cellular function in immunity. We hypothesize that prefabricated regulatory and coding activities encoded by ERVs have been repeatedly co-opted during mammalian evolution to enhance immune defense functions. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of ERVs in the regulatory evolution of a major component of the innate immune system: the interferon response. We will provide direct experimental evidence that a primate- specific ERV has become a critical regulator of the human inflammasome. To obtain a comparative, genome- wide assessment of the role of ERVs in shaping the interferon gene network across mammals, we will identify ERV-driven transcriptomic and chromatin changes induced upon interferon treatment of dermal fibroblasts from human, other primates, and rodents. Experimental manipulations in cell lines, including reporter assays, genome editing, and pathogen infection assays, will be used to validate the immune function of newly discovered ERV-derived cis-regulatory elements and novel interferon-stimulated genes. In Aim 2, we will deploy a novel computational pipeline combining genomic, expression, and evolutionary sequence analysis to produce a comprehensive catalog of ERV-derived envelope genes likely co-opted for cellular function in the human genome. Several envelope proteins expressed in healthy tissues and showing signatures of purifying and/or positive selection will be tested in cell culture assays for their ability to restrict infection of ancient and modern retroviruses. Together the outcomes of this proposal are anticipated to shift the perception of ERVs from inert retroviral fossils to actie contributors to the evolutionary plasticity of vertebrate immune defenses. In addition, our studies are bound to uncover new immunity genes in the human genome, including novel molecules with potentially therapeutic antiviral activities."
"9412773","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging and stress responses are tightly linked~ indeed, most interventions that extend lifespan appear to do so at least in part through potentiation of stress responses. Nevertheless, the genetic and mechanistic basis of this central relationship remains poorly understood. Here we will test the hypothesis that microRNAs (miRNAs) coordinate stress-responsive pathways in response to lifespan-prolonging interventions. We propose the following: To identify critical new miRNAs that link stress responses to aging in C. elegans, we profiled expression of small RNAs during development, aging and in stressed conditions (heat shock, starvation, hypoxia and oxidative stress). Since miRNAs that are differentially regulated during stress are likely to be mechanistic regulators of the stress response, we propose to characterize ten of the most differentially expressed miRNAs and determine their position in the gene-regulatory architecture of stress responses. We will also integrate our previous profiling and functional analyses of aging-associated miRNAs with these results to identify miRNAs that are associated with both stress and aging and test whether these genes provide mechanistic links between these conditions. To investigate network-level roles of microRNAs in regulation of stress and aging, we propose to elucidate the underlying regulatory network of genes and miRNAs involved in aging and stress. In order to identify critical new sets of miRNAs and pathways that link these processes, we have integrated transcription-factor binding site information, with miRNA target predictions to build a preliminary interaction network of the known regulatory relationships between transcription factors, aging- associated miRNAs, and miRNA biogenesis genes. We also propose to determine targets of key miRNAs biochemically via CLIP-seq and RNA-seq in the presence and absence of the miRNA. These data will allow us to improve the known miRNA-mRNA regulatory interaction network. Then, using this network, we will find miRNAs that comprise feedback loops and highly connected interaction nodes. We will test whether these highly connected miRNAs play critical roles in aging, stress responses, or in integrating the two. To identify miRNA mediators of lifespan extension due to dietary restriction. Our preliminary data point to miR-71 and miR-228 as key network nodes connected to pha-4 and skn-1, transcription factors critical for the response to dietary restriction and other stressors. We will characterize the roles of thes miRNAs and use our gene- regulatory network to identify other such candidate miRNAs. We also propose to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in dietary restriction via deep sequencing and include these in our network analysis above. We are uniquely well situated to carry out this work, as the Slack lab combines extensive experience in miRNAs and aging biology with leading expertise in genome-wide small-RNA characterization. MiRNA analogues and antagonists are pharmacologically tractable~ thus identifying critical aging and stress responsive miRNAs in C.  elegans may lead directly to lifespan and healthspan-prolonging interventions in humans."
"9419944","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human brain has a remarkable ability to flexibly allocate cognitive resources to meet task demands. Cognitive control machinery must maintain clear representation of current context (task demands), outcomes of prior choices, and control options for resolving conflict and adapting upcoming behavioral choices. Deficiencies in any of these operations can contribute to neuropsychiatric dysfunction.  Research to date identifies a network of areas, including the dACC, as essential to cognitive control. However, key aspects of cognitive control, including how network components interact, and how they represent and manage conflict, remain controversial. On a technical level, the wide gap between methods used in human and monkey studies raises a host of uncertainties, including the possibility of substantial interspecies differences in cognitive control machinery. We identify and target two major impediments to progress: 1) lack of a robust, yet specific conceptual framework that can integrate disparate empirical findings; and 2) lack of high quality human data spanning the scale from single neuron spikes to population activity.  We begin with an integrative conceptual model. The expected value of control (EVC) theory has recently been advanced to explain the role of the dACC in cognitive control. According to this model, the dACC weighs the expected benefit of successfully completing a control-demanding task against the cost required to do so. Based on this calculation, it generates a signal that specifies which (if any) task to perform, and how much control to allocate to the task. Specifically, the EVC model predicts that the dACC should perform the key functions mentioned at the outset: current context monitoring, outcome monitoring, and control signal specification. We test these functions with methods that effectively bridge the gap between single neuron activity in monkeys and noninvasive population measures in humans.  We propose a series of experiments using functional imaging and intracranial electrophysiology methods in humans. Subjects will be patients with medically intractable epilepsy scheduled for intracranial electrode implantation for seizure monitoring. Prior to electrode implantation, they will undergo high-resolution fMRI. While implanted, they will perform behavioral tasks designed to test hypotheses regarding the role of the dACC as predicted by EVC theory. We will collect simultaneous single-unit and LFP recordings from dACC and LFPs from lateral PFC.  Our broad goal is to validate a comprehensive theory of cognitive control using multi-modality human recordings. We do so by testing 3 Specific Aims aligned with the 3 proposed dACC functions mentioned above. In Specific Aim 1, we clarify the current context monitoring function of the dACC. We test hypotheses that the dACC encodes pure conflict signals, and that these neurons phase-lock to theta rhythms to coordinate dACC communication with other control-related regions. In Specific Aim 2, we define the outcome monitoring function of the dACC. We test hypotheses that human dACC neurons encode reward prediction errors (RPEs) and that these neurons entrain to theta oscillations to generate error- and feedback-related theta signals that can be observed on mid-frontal scalp EEG. Using information transfer analyses, we further hypothesize that RPE information travels from dACC to lateral PFC using theta-range oscillations. In Specific Aim 3, we establish evidence for a control specification function of the dACC. We test hypotheses investigating control signal targeting and intensity specification.  Many neuropsychiatric disorders are attributable to the inability to ascribe appropriate value to contextual stimuli, attend to relevant features while ignoring irrelevant ones, and sequentially increase or decrease reward contingencies of actions based on feedback. Examples of disorders of this process include mood/anxiety disorders (OCD, depression, affective aspects of chronic pain), addiction, attention deficit disorders, and psychoses. A clearer appreciation of the neurophysiology of human cognitive control will be essential for the successful understanding and treatment of these behavioral disorders."
"9415096","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social cues, such as eye gaze, facial and bodily emotion, gender, appearance, have largely been studied independent of one another, often isolated within separate fields. Emotional expression, for example, has been most extensively studied within a social psychological framework, and facial identity largely within a visual cognition framework. Importantly, neither discipline adequately addresses the combined influences of various cues on social perception. This research takes an interdisciplinary, multi-method approach to this question. A conceptual merger is required now, one that focuses specifically on the intersection of social cues in perceptual processing. Because of shared social meanings across cues, we predict that compound social cues will lead to interactions in brain systems known to be important for social and emotion processing, such as the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and superior temporal sulcus. We also predict that under conditions of restricted awareness, responses will be preferentially attuned to congruent (i.e., clear) cues, whereas for conscious processing they will be preferentially attuned to incongruent (i.e., ambiguous) threat cues. Research examining the neurobiological underpinnings of affective perception is in its formative stages. In the current application, we contend that social and emotional messages inherently share meaning. If substantiated, the complexities of our nonverbal social language will be more tractable and clearly delineated, and the interplay of reflexive- versus conscious-level processing will be further elucidated. Notably, the brain regions of interest that will be examined have been implicated in the types of socio-emotional impairments that characterize such psychopathological disorders as autism, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and Turner's syndrome, as well as various forms of related brain lesions (e.g., temporal lobectomy). We specifically aim to make significant strides toward future work applying compound social cue theory to patient populations with anxiety disorders and deficits in socio-emotional perception related to the particular brain systems of interest."
"9117281","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The VA has invested hugely in electronic medical records and has achieved a nationwide system that collects medical information from all patients. Currently, the textual information in the medical records is inaccessible to all but a small number of researchers. In order to obtain the highest value from this existing system, administrators and practitioners need to be able to access the textual information they need. It is our responsibility to get the most benefit from thi resource for biomedical and patient care. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is an important part the solution.  The value of NLP has been recognized in the biomedical domain. Evidence of this includes funding for the following national initiatives focused on clinical NLP: Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Consortium for Health Informatics Research (CHIR), VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP), and electronic Medical Records & Genomics (eMERGE). On the one hand, these efforts testify to the demand for NLP research. They have produced new NLP tools, created annotated datasets, developed common data models, shared semantic labels, and even piloted a prototype software ecosystem. On the other hand, the general consensus in the informatics community is that processing and utilizing textual data remains challenging due to lack of interoperability and collaboration. Unless the pace of research and development is accelerated in clinical NLP, we cannot meet the increasing NLP demand originated from the biomedical and health services research community.  Although synergistic development has the promise of advancing the science of NLP and accelerating the pace of NLP tool production, there lacks a vibrant collaborative environment attracting participation of a significant number of clinical NLP developers and researchers. Within the VA CHIR and VINCI efforts, we have created a prototype NLP ecosystem called V3NLP that supports the interoperability and integration of heterogeneous tools into VA research and operational initiatives. The environment needed to foster collaboration and a critical mass of users, however, is lacking. In the proposed project, we will study the needs of existing and potential users of the V3NLP ecosystem to increase its utility and ease of adoption and to facilitate collaboration.  The ultimate goal of an NLP ecosystem is to produce new and more accurate NLP methods for clinical text.  This requires a good understanding of the characteristics of various types of clinical text and the strengths and weakness of existing methods. Because most clinical NLP solutions have been driven by individual use cases and note collections, the resultant solutions are optimized for the characteristics of the specific NLP tasks and text corpora analyzed. Since there are numerous tasks and corpora, clinical NLP solutions tend to be difficult to re-use, especially by different developers. To remedy this, we will research characteristics of a very large and heterogeneous collection of VA text records to understand and model sublanguages in VA clinical notes. This systematic and comprehensive sublanguage analysis will play a critical role in the proposed ecosystem. It will guide the development of new clinical NLP methods as well as the customization of existing solutions.  Our general goal is to accelerate clinical NLP research and development. The specific aims are as follows:  (1) Collect and analyze the needs of NLP developers, health informatics researchers and health services researchers to inform the design of a collaborative NLP ecosystem that will facilitate development of more accurate methods.  (2) Design and implement a clinical NLP ecosystem that fosters collaboration and accelerates research and adoption of accurate and generalizable NLP methods.  (3) Conduct a comprehensive sublanguage analysis to guide the creation of adaptable NLP tools and methods based on VA text notes to support text processing and information extraction across multiple clinical domains."
"9417793","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Increased multi-factorial stress resistance is a property widely shared by models of extended longevity across evolutionary boundaries. Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor deficiencies, for example, which extend lifespan in experimental rodents, also increase resistance to acute oxidative stressors such as paraquat. Dietary restriction, in addition to extending longevity in a wide range of experimental organisms, confers protection against numerous clinically relevant acute stressors, including ischemia reperfusion injury to brain, kidney and liver as well as protection against the toxic side- effects of chemotherapy. Using diet-induced protection from ischemic injury as a model system, we recently identified a novel role for endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced by the transsulfuration pathway (TSP) in stress resistance and longevity regulation by dietary restriction. H2S is a gas produced by TSP enzymes CBS and CGL, whose primary role is to convert the essential amino acid methionine to cysteine. Exogenously added H2S can confer numerous benefits ranging from resistance to ischemic injury and suspended animation in experimental mammals, to extended longevity in flies and worms. However, endogenous H2S had not been previously linked to the benefits of dietary restriction. Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that increased endogenous H2S production by TSP enzymes underlies stress resistance and longevity benefits shared by long-lived models. In support of this hypothesis, TSP activity and H2S production are increased in a number of dietary restriction regimens across evolutionary boundaries including in yeast, worms and flies, and in multiple organs in mice upon fasting or dietary protein restriction. Our preliminary data indicate that H2S production by TSP enzymes is repressed by GH and mTOR signaling, two other pathways highly involved in regulation of longevity and stress resistance. Finally, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of CGL and H2S production prevented the benefits of short-term protein restriction against hepatic ischemic injury and protection of bone marrow stem cells from ionizing radiation. Together, these data warrant an investigation into the triggers of endogenous H2S production, the mechanisms by which it promotes oxidative stress resistance and stem cell regeneration, and its interaction with other longevity regulators such as the mitochondrial peptide humanin."
"9434936","Project Summary/Abstract: Owing to the successful use of engineered microbial opsins to remotely control neuronal excitability at high spatiotemporal resolution, considerable new insights into the causal relationship between circuit activity and neuropsychiatric diseases have been obtained through optogenetic approaches. Existing optogenetic tools are primarily designed to manipulate the flow of ions, such as sodium, potassium and chloride, that support an electrogenic role in the brain of mammals. By contrast, calcium ion passing through voltage gated calcium (CaV) channels not only alters membrane potential but also functions as an indispensable messenger to regulate neuronal gene expression, synaptic transmission, neurite outgrowth and memory formation. CaV channels are also essential for cardiac and smooth contractility. CaV channels serve as emerging and attractive therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular diseases. However, noninvasive tools to directly and selectively photo-modulate the flow of calcium ion in neurons and cardiomyocytes are still limited. Another technical roadblock that faces the current in vivo optogenetics and optical neuromodulation is the inability of most existing tools to stimulate deep and wide within the brain without the use of invasive indwelling fiber optic probes. To tackle these two technical challenges, we propose to optically inhibit CaV channel activity by engineering light sensitivities into key CaV negative regulators, and in parallel, to develop bio-compatible nano-antennae-upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as a ?cordless? optogenetic platform to capture and convert low power, tissue-penetrant, near infrared radiation (NIR) into blue light. This nanoantenna will act as a light-delivery transducer to modulate voltage-gated calcium channels, as well as calcium-dependent activities in excitable tissues, with precise spatiotemporal control. We propose two specific aims to advance our platform to excitable cells by using neuronal cells as proof-of-concept. In Aim 1, we will develop new optogenetic tools to photo-control CaV channel function, and characterize the capacity of our first-generation UCNPs to act as ?nanoantenna?. In Aim 2, we will develop next generation UCNPs with high photoconversion efficiencies and enhanced biocompatibility. We anticipate that our NIR light-stimulable optogenetic platform will enable remote and noninvasive control of cell activities in excitable tissues, and permit modulation of their intricate inter- cellular interactions under both physiological and pathological conditions at large scale. Given the wide distribution and close involvement of CaV channels in multiple diseases, the techniques and tools that we develop can be broadly extended to interrogate other types of tissues across multiple systems. In summary, the proposed early-stage, cordless optogenetic technology is anticipated to overcome many of the limitations of current fiber optics-based optogenetic approaches, and will enable new and broad applications in both biomedical research and human health."
"9416139","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."
"9599390","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Cardiovascular (CV) event prevention (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident) remains the single most important public health problem in the United States, and cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among VA users. Improving the provision of prevention services is a primary focus of the Secretary's New Models of Care Transformational Initiative. However, prevention has been challenging to achieve. Multifactorial behavioral interventions are effective in treating a number of chronic illnesses (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), but less is known about their ability to reduce risk among patients without a unifying chronic illness. Group visits are an efficient, effective strategy for delivering a multifactorial behavior change intervention; the VA is committed to the group visit strategy to address a wide array of primary care problems.  Groups have been shown to be an effective means of improving a number of outcomes in a number of individual diseases, but, again, their role in cardiovascular prevention among patients without a single common illness is unknown. Coaching is a type of multi-factorial behavioral intervention that involves goal-setting, and working to overcome barriers to behavior change. Coaching can be performed one-on-one, but coaching interventions have been delivered in group settings. We have shown, in a 150-subject RCT, that group coaching plus individualized telephone coaching reduces cardiovascular risk, but the population in that study was very different from typical VA users.   We propose a three-site, two-arm randomized trial measuring the effectiveness of a group prevention coaching (GPC) intervention in improving cardiovascular risk, compared to VA usual care. The study will be performed at the Durham, Buffalo, and Syracuse VAMCs. Each arm will have 200 patients; patients will be VA users without prior history of cardiovascular event, but with at least 5% risk of such an event, and with either inadequately controlled hypertension or dyslipidemia, or current smoking. The GPC intervention will focus on changing a behavior of the patient's choice that is likely to lead to improvements in cholesterol, blood pressure, or to smoking cessation. Behaviors that will be reinforced will include but not be limited to healthy eating, decreased caloric intake, increased physical activity, stress reduction, and participatory decision making with physicians. Barriers to these behaviors will be identified. The coach in both intervention arms will adopt a problem-solving approach to overcoming the above barriers and reinforcing the above behaviors; problem- solving is a well-described framework for behavior change. The GPC coach/interventionist for will be either the  facility's Health Behavior Coordinator (HBC) or a  person hired for the research enterprise but trained and  credentialed identically to an HBC.   All  outcomes will be obtained at baseline and 6 months after enrollment by blinded research personnel.  The primary outcome will be change in 10-year risk of fatal coronary event or non-fatal MI 6 months after enrollment, as measured by Framingham Risk Score. Key secondary outcomes will include dietary content by Food Frequency Questionnaire (26), physical activity as measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire (27), and weight. We will also determine if group cohesion, as measured by the Group Dynamics Inventory (28), influences the effectiveness of GPC. We well also assess whether time spent in contact with a coach influences the effectiveness, by database log-in timekeeping strategies."
"9510697","Project Summary  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by progressive demyelination of axons in the central nervous system (CNS). One major approach to developing new MS treatments is the development of therapeutics that can act on myelin-producing oligodendrocytes to enhance the production and/or stability of myelin. Toward this end, it is important to identify potential drug targets that are selectively enriched in oligodendrocytes and capable of promoting myelin stability. GPR37 is a nervous system-specific G protein-coupled receptor that is highly expressed in oligodendrocytes. We performed proteomic analyses of brain tissue from GPR37 knockout (Gpr37-/-) mice and found that one of the most dramatically down-regulated proteins was the myelin- associated glycoprotein (MAG), which is a myelin-enriched protein known to regulate myelin stability. In parallel studies, we found that GPR37 and MAG form complexes in cells. Since MAG-deficient mice are known to exhibit significantly more severe demyelination in response to insults, we explored the Gpr37-/- mice in the cuprizone model of demyelination and found that these mice exhibit a much more dramatic loss of myelin than wild-type mice in response to cuprizone treatment. Given the striking similarity in phenotypes between Gpr37-/- and MAG-deficient mice, we hypothesize that the interaction between GPR37 and MAG exerts effects on oligodendrocyte physiology and myelination. This hypothesis will be tested by i) dissecting the structural determinants of the interaction between GPR37 & MAG and ii) studying mutual regulation between GPR37 and MAG in cultured oligodendrocytes from Gpr37-/- mice. These studies will shed light on the interaction and mutual regulation between the oligodendrocyte-enriched proteins GPR37 and MAG, which will lead to a greater understanding of both proteins in the regulation of oligodendrocyte physiology and myelination. Moreover, the studies proposed here will enhance our knowledge of the action of GPR37 in regulating myelination and thereby set the stage for the targeting of this receptor by novel therapeutics aimed at treating MS and other myelination disorders. ! !"
"9424415","PROJECT SUMMARY The immune system plays a critical role in human health by sensing and destroying foreign invaders such as viruses, bacterium, parasites, and other sources of infection. Activating the immune response can help fight off a range of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and cancer. Conversely, inhibiting the immune response can help treat autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, and atherosclerosis. As such, there has been significant and growing interest in developing new therapeutics for regulating the immune response, both in stimulating or suppressing it, to treat a wide variety of human diseases. One particular area of interest lies in the development of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. TLRs are a well-studied family of pattern recognition receptors that stimulate the innate immune response when activated by the appropriate agonist. However, most TLR agonist-based therapeutics are not selective for which physiological regions are immunologically stimulated. TLR activity and the ensuing immune response may thus occur indiscriminately, leading to inflammation responses at undesired physiological sites, which can lead to disease exacerbation. Synthetically engineering the TLR agonist so that its primary release occurs specifically at disease sites may potentially increase immunotherapeutic potency while also reducing unwanted inflammation at healthy locations. The driving hypothesis of this proposal is to determine whether TLR agonists can be caged so that they are immunologically inactive until they detect specific bioanalytes, at which point they will self-immolate to release the free agonists and stimulate the immune response. The ability to cage and release TLR agonists was demonstrated previously by Esser-Kahn and coworkers, who utilized directed UV light to release TLR agonists and stimulate innate immune cells. We will use similar tools and metrics (NF-?B activity, cytokine and cell surface marker production, confocal microscopy) to characterize immune cell activation here, but exploit the local chemistry at the disease site to achieve higher specificity over uncaged therapeutics. The specific aims of this proposal that we will use to validate our hypothesis are to establish cage-and-release systems that are triggered by two specific bioanalytes: (a) the ferrous ion (Fe2+), and (b) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These bioanalytes were selected under the guiding principle that cancer cells contain severely elevated levels of both these species. However, our therapeutic strategy should be applicable to other disease states that involve dysregulated iron metabolism or generate high levels of H2O2. We will study the immune response in RAW- blue 264.7 macrophage reporters and primary dendritic cells that have been exposed to varying levels of Fe2+ and H2O2. Upon detecting these bioanalytes, the cage will fall apart and the immunotherapeutic payload will be released. If our hypothesis is validated, our findings may establish TLR agonists as therapeutics that can initiate immune responses at specific locations or under specific disease conditions (high levels of Fe2+ or H2O2), leading to enhanced cell-mediated immunity and enabling more potent and directed therapeutics."
"9500045","Neural communication is governed by the release of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles at the synaptic active zone (AZ). Several fundamental forms of neurotransmitter release are present at synapses, including synchronous mono- and multi-vesicular release, asynchronous and spontaneous release. Each of these release mechanisms plays important and distinct roles in synaptic development and function. However, despite several decades of research, how these canonical forms or release are organized and regulated in central synapses is poorly understood. This includes some of the most fundamental features of release, including the number, spatial organization and reuse of release sites supporting different forms of release, all of which remain largely undetermined because of the extremely small size and relative inaccessibility of central synapses to conventional recording techniques. Moreover, how the spatiotemporal properties and reuse of the release sites are regulated by neural activity is largely unknown. To overcome these limitations, we developed a nanoscale-resolution imaging approach that in combination with a pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator genetically tagged to the vesicle lumen, allows us to resolve individual vesicle fusion events at the AZ with ~27 nm precision. With this approach we have uncovered the presence of multiple distinct release sites in central synapses and demonstrated that their spatiotemporal properties are regulated by neural activity. By complementing this approach with computational single-molecule tools we are also able to robustly detect all other canonical forms of release. Our approach also permits us to visualize and track translocation of individual synaptic vesicles to the AZ, a critical time-limiting step in the refilling of the release sites during neural activity. Here we propose to combine this nanoscale-resolution imaging approach with advanced computational, genetic and pharmacological tools to study, at a single-vesicle level, the mechanisms governing organization and regulation of the canonical forms of neurotransmitter release at individual central synapses. We will further define the mechanisms governing vesicle translocation to the release sites and their activity-dependent regulation. These studies will provide major new insights into fundamental mechanisms of synaptic function."
"9408663","ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY ? PROJECT 3 ? BIOMARKERS OF HUMAN EPILEPTOGENESIS AFTER TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY The mechanisms underlying human acquired epileptogenesis remain poorly understood and a novel multimodal approach to study the process from inception to manifest clinical epilepsy is needed. We have selected Post-Traumatic Epilepsy (PTE) as a model to pursue this understanding because the timing of the potential epileptogenic insult is known and the period of epileptogenesis can be determined. The EpiBioS4Rx Scientific Premise is Epileptogenesis after TBI can be prevented with specific treatments; the identification of relevant biomarkers and performance or rigorous preclinical trials will permit the future design and performance of economically feasible full-scale clinical trials of antiepileptogenic therapies. In Project 3, we plan to perform a multicenter, multidisciplinary observational study of early epileptogenesis after moderate-severe TBI in 300 subjects with the specific injury phenotype of temporal and/or frontal lobe hemorrhagic contusional injury that matches the experimental injury models in animal Projects 1 and 2. We plan four specific aims that feature determining measuring the presence of early electroencephalographic, MRI and blood biomarkers of epileptogenesis. In aim 4, we plan to create the ideal clinical trial network and trial design informed by our animal Project 2 as well as shared data from large biomarkers trials in both adults (TRACK, CENTER) and children (ADAPT) with TBI. In the Public Engagement Core, we have recruited an outstanding multidisciplinary team of consumers, consumer advocates and key opinion leaders in TBI, PTE, and Epilepsy Clinical Trials to work in this project. We plan a highly integrated and adaptive study design across all 3 Projects and 3 Cores of EpiBioS4Rx to enable a rigorous experimental design for robust and unbiased results. Integration is demonstrated by injury type, methodology, mechanistic investigation, shared analysis and methods, shared public engagement core, and shared DSMB The ultimate goal is to develop a personalized medicine approach for a future definitive clinical trial for an antiepileptogenic drug for PTE."
"9406140","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minorities continue to be underrepresented in biomedical PhD programs and, thus, the biomedical workface does not reflect the diversity of our nation. Rush University will contribute to the training of underrepresented minority PhD students in biomedical sciences by establishing a new Rush Initiative to Maximize Student Performance (IMSD). We recognize that success in the modern age of biomedical research involves two important arms, one is classical training of graduate students to be productive scientists and the other is the development of professional tools that are increasingly relevant to navigate a rigorous PhD program and one's career thereafter. Towards this end, the Rush IMSD will integrate scientific and professional training activities to ensure that Rush IMSD participant will be fully prepared to complete the PhD program and enter the biomedical workforce. Specifically, we will: 1) Establish training activities to secure key tools necessary to develop ino a productive PhD student and a scientist, including training modules on how to choose a dissertation research advisor (mentor), utilization of helpful research tools, grant writing and review, poster and oral presentations, and education in challenges that face minorities in science, and 2) Establish training activities to support the professional development of Rush IMSD participants and provide them with coping skills to manage the demands of a PhD program and a career in science. These professional skills will be provided through interactive training modules in several areas such as conflict resolution, time management, verbal and respectful non-verbal communication, emotional intelligence, personal financial budgeting and fiscal responsibility of running a lab, exposure to career opportunities in biomedical research, and interviewing skills. Rush IMSD participants will be monitored by an IMSD-student advisory committee, which will ensure their continued success and devise intervention plans. The Rush IMSD program will be steered by internal and external advisory committees. The program will be evaluated by an outside group through a well- integrated process to track, report, and assess long-term outcomes of Rush IMSD trainees. Strength of the Rush IMSD will be a smaller university setting that can facilitate meaningful interactions between faculty and IMSD participants, yet nationally recognized leaders in their respective fields who have a strong record of teaching and mentorships. Collectively, we anticipate that these efforts will increase enrollment of minority PhD students at Rush, support their education and professional development, and that the Rush IMSD instituted model for graduate student training will evolve into a platform that has university sustainability and partnerships."
"9503359","Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to support the PI?s development into an independent patient-oriented researcher with expertise in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and B cell biology. The PI will be mentored in all aspects of the proposal and receive training in systems biology approaches to human immunology research. Candidate - The PI holds MD and PhD degrees, has completed internal medicine residency and allergy/immunology fellowship at Mount Sinai Medical Center, and has been appointed Assistant Professor in Department of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He has joined the laboratory of Dr. Charlotte Cunningham-Rundles and his preliminary work defined the immunological characteristics of CVID non-infectious complications. Elucidating pathogenesis of these complications is the focus of this proposal. Research ? CVID is the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency. Its greatest morbidity and mortality results from non-infectious complications, namely autoimmunity (AI) and lymphoid hyperplasia (LH). The PI has previously detailed the cellular characteristics of pulmonary LH underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD) in these patients and defined clinical and laboratory associations of these complications. Recently, the PI found B cell activating factor (BAFF) elevated in the CVID patients with progressive AI and LH and the cytokine to be produced locally in the lungs of patients with ILD. Also, BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) expression and signaling is localized to follicles within LH, B cell maturation is most profoundly arrested in CVID patients with AI and LH, and apoptosis resistance of the persisting immature B cell subsets is mediated by BAFF. We hypothesize that AI and LH result from excessive BAFF-R signaling in immature B cell subsets in CVID. Career Development - The primary mentor (Dr. Cunningham-Rundles) is the David S. Gottesman Professor of Immunology at Mount Sinai and is an international authority on CVID. She runs the NIH-funded lab in which the PI will be based and directs the large clinical immunology practice from which study subjects will be recruited. Co-mentor Dr. Andrea Cerutti is an expert in T cell-independent activation of B cells via cytokines such as BAFF and is a Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Additional advisory committee members are respected investigators with diverse expertise that will supplement the candidate?s research mentorship and career development. The candidate will also benefit from the collaborative research environment of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and complete coursework in bioinformatics and systems biology. Synopsis ? Drawing upon a focused research approach, expert mentorship, and a strategic educational plan, this proposal details a 5 year training program for an academic career in primary immunodeficiency and human B cell biology. At the conclusion of training, the PI will be positioned to become an independent physician scientist with expertise in CVID, BAFF biology, and high throughput human immunology research methods."
"9607263","Abstract  Prevention of major depressive disorder (MDD) is a public health priority, and is in critical need of innovative strategies that preemptively identify those at-risk in order to enable early intervention. A recent meta-analysis of over 20 longitudinal studies found the risk for incident depression among individuals with insomnia disorder is nearly three times that for normal sleepers, thus making insomnia a potential point of entry for depression prevention.  Identification and treatment of insomnia typically occurs in primary care, and is commonly treated with hypnotic medications; however, hypnotics have significant limitations, including increased risk for residual impairment, falls in the elderly, and abuse. Cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I) has been recommended as a first line approach with demonstrated efficacy that is sustained beyond initial therapeutic intervention. However, effective and widespread implementation of CBT-I is severely limited by the national shortage of trained practitioners in clinical practice. A stepped care approach rooted in primary care holds potential for innovative accessibility and delivery of CBT-I, improving insomnia therapeutics, and reducing rates of MDD by targeting a robust yet modifiable risk factor in insomnia. Our proposed stepped care model uses digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT-I) as an accessible, least-restrictive, first line intervention that reduces specialist time and resources, and adds clinician based face-to-face CBT-I only for refractory patients who need a more personalized, flexible, and durable therapist driven approach.  We propose a large-scale clinical trial in the primary care setting that utilizes a stepped care model (SMART design) to determine the effectiveness of dCBT-I alone and in combination with face-to-face CBT-I for insomnia, and the effects of these sleep interventions on the prevention of MDD. An important innovative component of the trial is the 1 and 2-year follow-up assessments to determine the durability of effectiveness over time and assess the impact on depression incidence and relapse. Early risk-detection and prevention is especially critical in those at elevated risk for depression to reduce health disparities. Thus, individuals with significant vulnerability to MDD, such as high sleep-reactivity, low socioeconomic status, and racial minorities will be included in significant numbers to test for potential moderation of treatment effects stratified by risk.  Finally, improving sleep through insomnia treatment may reduce nocturnal rumination, which may mitigate progression toward MDD. As such, we will determine whether changes in nocturnal rumination (i.e., target), a modifiable risk-factor, mediates the effects of CBT-I and dCBT-I on MDD incidence and relapse.  This project will test a highly scalable model of sleep care in a large primary care system to determine the potential for wide dissemination to address the high volume of population need for safe and effective insomnia treatment and associated prevention of depression."
"9553026","ABSTRACT Modifying stem cells by insertion of anti-HIV gene or gene editing technologies can theoretically result in an HIV proof immune system in patients after stem cell transplantation. The success of the ?Berlin patient? receiving CCR5 negative cells for transplantation has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. Thereafter, a myriad gene therapy trials targeting CCR5 to prevent HIV entry have been tried with inconclusive results. Recent, mathematical modeling data suggests that CCR5 disrupting strategies alone will fail to suppress HIV load unless combined with a suicide gene. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new combination gene therapy vectors and methodologies that can be used to enrich vector modified stem cells before transplantation to ensure robust engraftment. Our proposal addresses these issues via a two-step vector system that incorporates multiple safety as well as selection features. Our vector 1 is a conditional vector that expresses the TK-SR39 gene only in the presence of HIV Tat protein. TK-SR39 is a TK mutant that is highly potent at killing cells in the presence of small amounts of Ganciclovir, a drug routinely used for Herpes virus treatment in HIV infected individuals. Furthermore, our vector incorporates an added unique feature that it also transiently expresses a Tat inducible modified CD4 (CD4mod) that is a CD4 molecule lacking the cytoplasmic domain as well as HIV Env binding region. This will provide a mechanism to purify modified cells using immunomagnetic beads while eliminating its use as a receptor for HIV entry. To induce transient expression of CD4mod we will use vector 2 that expresses HIV Tat and a CRISPR-CCR5 cassette to knockout CCR5. Thus, cells modified by this two-step vector system will have CCR5 knockout as well as conditional expression of TK-SR39 and CD4mod that will allow easy selection of cells. Thus, these cells encompass multiple layers of anti-HIV activity as 1) because of CCR5 knock out they will resist HIV infection 2) in case of CXCR4 virus emergence, the cytotoxic potential of TK-SR39 can be utilized via GCV administration 3) this will lead to rapid death of infected cells thereby minimizing virus spread and preventing establishment of latent reservoirs. The superiority of our approach lies in targeting the virus at multiple fronts and allowing a method to sort modified cells that is the key to long-term engraftment in vivo."
"9540283","Project Summary/Abstract Depression takes an enormous toll on individual and economic health. Although current antidepressant therapies provide relief for some individuals, many patients are inadequately treated which can lead to suicide. Thus, there is desperate need to identify new targets for depression treatment. A growing body of preclinical and clinical work implicates maladaptive signaling in the nucleus accumbens in the etiology of depression. Here I aim to identify how dendritic remodeling of nucleus accumbens projection neurons contributes to depression development and symptomology in a preclinical model of depression. Using this model, I have collected preliminary data showing increased dendritic atrophy and upregulation of a dendritic complexity molecule RhoA in specific nucleus accumbens neurons. Further, pharmacological manipulation of RhoA in the nucleus accumbens can promote or prevent depressive outcomes to stress. In this study, we intend to utilize cutting- edge molecular and in vivo imaging techniques to investigate how RhoA mediates dendritic atrophy and depression-like behavior in specific nucleus accumbens neurons. Specific aim 1 utilizes novel genetic tools to express active and inactive RhoA in select cell types. We will characterize how active and inactive RhoA contribute to depression-like behavior and assess their roles in promoting or preventing depressive outcomes to social stress. Specific aim 2 utilizes in vivo imaging to test whether blocking active RhoA in select cell types can prevent decreases in neural activity found in mice displaying depressive behaviors. Together, these experiments will provide new information on the molecular mechanisms of dendritic remodeling in depression, which has the potential to inform about future depression therapeutics."
"9494911","Immature excitatory synapses in the perinatal brain contain high release probability (Pr) presynaptic terminals coupled to postsynaptic specializations with GluN2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors (hi-Pr, hi-GluN2B synapses). For over two decades, we have known that these immature synapses mature in an activity- dependent manner to low-Pr, low-GluN2B synapses, but the mechanisms that coordinate this transition, why it occurs, and how it contributes to circuit plasticity and stability remain controversial and are fundamental unanswered questions. Addressing these issues will identify basic mechanisms that control synapse development and that may be disrupted in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Disruption of the Arg/Abl2 kinase in mice yields a population of hi-Pr, hi-GluN2B synapses that persist into early adulthood. The persistence of these immature synapses drives a >40% net loss of hippocampal synapses between postnatal day (P) 21 and P42, and impairs synaptic plasticity and behavior. Building on these findings, we will identify new regulators of synapse maturation, and determine how they regulate synaptic plasticity and stability. In Aim 1, we will identify the cell surface receptors that activate Arg to coordinate the maturation from hi-Pr, hi- GluN2B synapses to low-Pr, low-GluN2B synapses. We provide preliminary data that integrin ?3?1 adhesion receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ? (PDGFR?) act upstream of Arg to control synapse function and stability. We will use selective gene inactivation in the pre- and postsynaptic neurons along with genetic epistasis and rescue experiments to address how and where these receptors interact with Arg and each other to regulate Pr and postsynaptic GluN2B levels. In Aim 2, we will elucidate how Arg mediates GluN2B downregulation at the synapse. Arg-mediated signaling is critical to downregulate GluN2B during maturation. We identified the SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase and the NMDAR-associated protein BRAG1, both mutated in intellectual disability, as likely functional links between Arg and developmental GluN2B downregulation. We will use biochemical, cell-based, and genetic approaches to test how Arg interacts with SHP2 and BRAG1 to downregulate GluN2B function. In Aim 3, we will characterize how immature and mature synapses differentially contribute to plasticity and stability. We will use patterned glutamate uncaging at single synapses to test whether hi-Pr, hi-GluN2B and low-Pr, low-GluN2B synapses have altered ability to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in arg?/? mice. We will use in vivo imaging to examine how enlarged dendritic spines at hi- Pr, hi-GluN2B cortical synapses in arg?/? mice differ from normal spines in their plasticity and stability. Our studies will elucidate the mechanisms by which receptors act through Arg and its downstream targets to control Pr and NMDAR composition during synapse maturation. Disruption of these mechanisms may underlie the defects in synapse development, plasticity, and stability in intellectual disability and other brain disorders."
"9415434","ABSTRACT  Microglia,-the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), are thought to be important contributors to CNS health and' disease but their exact functional roles are still mysterious. Direct CNS damage, as well as peripheral injuries and addictive drug exposure, all induce microglial activation. A longstanding limitation in investigating microglia is the lack of good tools to distinguish and manipulate microglia specifically without altering macrophages or other immune cell types. In this proposal we will use new tools that our lab has recently generated to specifically identify and genetically manipulate microglia in order to investigate their function. First we will use these tools to develop the first in vitro culture system in which purified microglial cells can be cultured in defined serum-free medium with high survival in a non- activated state. This will enable us to directly test their specific functions for the first time including their ability to promote neuronal and glial survival, or to regulate synapse formation and function, as well as to elucidate the specific signals that induce their activation and to assess how their normal functions are altered when microglia become activated. Second, we will perform metabolomics analysis to investigate nature of the chemical signaling molecules that resting and activated microglial cells secrete. Third, we will use the new genetic tools we have developed to ablate microglia to elucidate their role in the establishment and maintenance of reactive gliosis and neuropathic pain. Lastly vye will identify the specific molecular mechanisms through which microglial cells influence these processes. Presently, drugs available for treatment of pain, such as opiates, suffer from undesired side effects and the development of tolerance. The purpose of the proposed research is to determine the molecular events that produce glial cell mediated neural circuitry modifications, opioid tolerance and addiction, as well as neuropathic pain in order to identify novel therapeutic targets. The findings will lay the groundwork for future research in understanding the role of microglia in drug- induced plasticity in reward-related neuronal circuits."

"9418618","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy for human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), is the most common genetically defined cause of intellectual disability. Structural abnormalities that are thought to contribute to learning problems are seen in the cerebellum and hippocampus of people with the condition. Treatments to correct these parts of the brain would tangibly improve the lives of children and young adults with DS and would allow them to better integrate into society. Relevance to NICHD: We recently showed that that a single injection on the day of birth of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway agonist, SAG, permanently normalizes the size and gross anatomy of the cerebellum, leads to better adult spatial problem solving, and restores electrophysiological correlates of learning in the CA1- hippocampal subfield of the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. A number of questions remain before this finding can be translated to therapy for people. We will determine how region-specific expression of Shh in the Ts65Dn brain affects hippocampal function using a conditional temporal-spatial genetics approach. This will allow us to increase Shh expression around the time of birth only within the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, or within the hippocampus, to determine where Shh stimulation is necessary and/or sufficient to correct the behavior and physiology of adult Ts65Dn mice in hippocampal tests (Specific Aim 1).  Another restraint on advancing Shh treatments to the clinic is the very wide range of effects of this potent growth factor, making systemic application in people problematic. A more confined method of drug delivery might limit side effects. Another approach is to understand which Hsa21 genes act to down-regulate the Shh pathway response in cerebellum, which might suggest more druggable targets. We identified several candidate genes in a screen of over 100 Hsa21 cDNAs in two Shh reporter cell lines and in zebrafish embryos. Genes that significantly decrease Shh pathway activation in the LIGHT2 assay will be evaluated in additional Shh-sensitive assays to assure that they generalize across different biological systems and their specificity determined using genetic models (Specific Aim 2).  Finally, Davisson's Ts65Dn mouse transformed research in DS but after 20 years, limitations in this and in fact in all mouse models have emerged. We will open a new era of investigation with a better model for behavioral and pharmacological testing by making a rat with a stably integrated copy of Hsa21 (Specific Aim 3)."

"9454964","ABSTRACT The objective of the present grant proposal is to demonstrate how inborn gene mutations can sensitize the pancreas to alcohol-induced injury and result in alcoholic pancreatitis. The specific hypothesis tested posits that alcohol and mutations that affect digestive enzyme folding synergize in promoting endoplasmic reticulum stress and causing progressive acinar cell damage. In this setting, the pancreas becomes more sensitive to insults and responds with acute attacks of inflammation (alcoholic acute pancreatitis) which eventually progress to chronic disease (alcoholic chronic pancreatitis). Our proposed studies will take advantage of a novel genetically engineered mouse strain, which carries a ?misfolding? mutation in the mouse carboxypeptidase A1 (Cpa1) gene. We will study how in this strain an alcohol diet affects spontaneous pancreatic damage, ER stress markers, cell death pathways and pathological responses in experimentally induced acute pancreatitis."
"9415738","Altered lipid homeostasis and increased whole body fat are hallmarks of obesity which has become a national epidemic. In turn, mammalian intestinal absorption of lipids is dependent on bile acids. Bile acids themselves are reabsorbed in the distal ileum via the intestinal apical sodium-dependent bile acid co-transporter (ASBT, SC10A2) localized at the brush border membrane (BBM) of absorptive villus cells. ASBT is the sole bile acid absorptive mechanism in the human intestine. While increased lipid absorption is known in obesity, how ASBT mediated intestinal bile acid absorption may be regulate in obesity is not known. Preliminary studies in well- established in-vivo models of obesity, specifically in Obese Zucker rats and TALLYHO mice, suggest that ASBT is increased in villus cells. This is not secondary to altered Na-extruding capacity of the cell as Na-K- ATPase levels were not increased but decreased in these cells. Similar observations were seen in obese humans. Given these translationally relevant novel observations, the overall hypothesis of this proposal is that enhanced lipid absorption of obesity mediated by bile acids is facilitated by stimulation of ASBT during obesity. Therefore, the overall aim of this proposal is to determine the molecular and intracellular mechanisms of regulation of ASBT in obesity. Three specific aims will complementarily and comprehensively address this novel hypothesis: Aim 1. Determine the broad applicability of stimulation of ASBT in villus cells during obesity Aim 2. Delineate the specific transcriptional mechanism of stimulation of ASBT in villus cells. Aim 3. Determine the specific post-transcriptional mechanism of stimulation of ASBT in villus cells. The results of these studies will provide new and important knowledge of the regulation of the ASBT in obesity which may allow for the design of ASBT inhibitors that would reduce lipid absorption and decrease obesity. The novel observations of this proposal about the regulation of ASBT during obesity will provide the basis for a future R01 application, which will focus on the intracellular mechanism of regulation of ASBT stimulation as well as the alterations in ASBT in human obesity. Ultimately, better understanding of ASBT regulation in obesity will result in better treatment modalities for the obesity epidemic in this country."
"9414564","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 1 Prognosis is the risk of an outcome for a condition or disease, such as mortality of mobility impairment. A  2 prognostic index assembles the risk from multiple risk factors to predict outcome more accurately than a single  3 factor would predict on its own. Current prognostic indexes suffer either from being inaccurate, un-  4 interpretable, or both. Consequently, clinicians are unable to accurately determine prognosis in clinical  5 decision making for older adults, often leading to poor outcomes for patients. Many older adults are referred to  6 hospice in the last few hours or days before death, or never at all Other patients are exposed to the harms of  7 cancer screening without the possibility they will live long enough to benefit. Currently available prognostic  8 models estimate risk over a given time frame, such as risk of death over a 4 year period. Clinicians and  9 patients do not think of risk this way, however. They want to know how long do I have? This project will 10 address this question by making novel use of the exceptionally long follow up time in the nationally 11 representative National Institute of Aging-funded Health and Retirement Study. The objectives of this project 12 are to use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to develop and validate easy-to-use prognostic tools that 13 estimate life-expectancy and time to the onset of disability, inability to manage medications or finances, or 14 mobility impairment. Prognostic tools will be internally validated using the HRS and externally validated 15 using the English Longitudinal Study on Aging (ELSA). This approach leverages the fact that the ELSA was 16 based on the HRS. This project is expected to have a positive impact by informing, individualizing, and 17 improving clinical decision-making in older adults."

"9530357","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Part C The aim of this project is to implement and evaluate a best practice Urologic Management Protocol for the Preservation of Renal Function (UPPF) in the Newborn/Young Child with Spina Bifida. The goal of the protocol is to develop standardized and effective urologic management in infants and young children with spina bifida, to preserve kidney function, lay the groundwork for long term continence and optimize long term health and well-being. It is estimated that 70,000 people in the United States are currently living  with spina bifida. The majority of patients with spina bifida experience urologic complications related to their condition, including incontinence and possibly renal damage. Over the past several decades, significant advancements have been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in children, which has allowed for earlier, more proactive therapeutic interventions aimed at the prevention of renal deterioration. Renal failure has historically been the leading cause of mortality in patients with myelomeningocele (MMC) followed through adulthood, reportedly accounting for a third of deaths. The significant impact of contemporary management with proactive urodynamic investigation, clean intermittent catheterization, antibiotic prophylaxis and anticholinergic therapy in children with MMC has shown a marked reduction in the rate of overall renal parenchymal damage. This project is innovative as it is a long term prospective study to test and evaluate the use of a standardized urologic management protocol for patients with spina bifida, beginning in the neonatal period. The data gathered through this project will provide researchers and clinicians with a robust database to test a systematic urologic protocol and to examine the long term urologic status of the population, enabling the development of evidence based clinical interventions to improve care outcomes and quality of life. Project objectives include outreach and education to CHLA faculty and staff, recruitment of 5-10 newborns per year from our Neonatal and Infant Critical Care Unit, implementation of the urologic protocol and collection and submission of data to the CDC, investigation of the effects of a standardized workflow on patient adherence and overall renal outcomes, assessment of parent and staff satisfaction with the urologic protocol, participation in research with other sites, and dissemination of findings."
"9597826","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cryptococcal meningitis is one of the most important opportunistic infections affecting people living with HIV/AIDS. Recent epidemiologic studies indicate that approximately 1 million new cases occur each year and over 700,000 people die each year; in sub-Saharan Africa, more HIV patients die of cryptococcal meningitis each year than tuberculosis. The gold standard therapy for cryptococcosis is amphotericin B combined with 5-flucytosine. Although this regimen is easily administered in resource-rich regions of the world, it is not available in many resource-limited regions with the highest burden of disease. In these regions, fluconazole, a less effective, fungistatic agent, is used because it is readily available, safe, and administered orally. Unfortunately, patients treated with FLU have much higher death rates; this has been attributed to the fungistatic activity of FLU. Thus, new therapies for cryptococcosis are urgently needed and this is the long-term goal of our project. Because molecules with fungicidal activity are clinically superior to fungistatic drugs, we have developed a high throughput screening assay that directly identifies molecules with fungicidal activity toward C. neoformans. We have screened two distinct libraries with the assay: 1) a 350,000 compound library through an NIH-funded Molecular Probes and Library Screening Network project and 2) a focused set of 700 molecules from Merck Laboratories collection of anti-candidal molecules. The former screen was designed to identify a molecule with activity against cell wall related processes in C. neoformans: a novel benzimidazole thiourea scaffold with low human toxicity and good anti-cryptococcal activity emerged from this screen. We will identify its mechanism of action in Aim 1 to set the stage for subsequent optimization of its anti-cryptococcal activity. From the Merck Library, we have identified 22 molecules with fungicidal activity against C. neoformans at concentrations ? 2 µg/mL. We will complete the secondary screening of the set of Merck library hits in Aim 2 and identify the mechanism of action for a tota of four high priority scaffolds. Initial evaluation indicates that a set of squalene synthase inhibitors are among the hits. We will test that hypothesis and identify the target of three high priority scaffolds from the remaining hits. The mechanistic information that emerges from this exploratory project will be used as a basis for a subsequent application to optimize the anti-cryptococcal activity of the scaffolds."
"9453922","Abstract  An enduring problem for alcohol and drug abuse treatment is relapse following quit attempts. Typical animal models of relapse using operant self-administration techniques produce abstinence by withholding alcohol or drug reinforcement (i.e., extinction). Next, animals are exposed to drug, drug cues, or drug contexts to induce relapse. It is well known that drug and non-drug reinforcers interact, and treatments providing alternative non-drug reinforcers have been very successful. Unfortunately when non-drug reinforcers are discontinued, relapse is very common. More generally, some sources of relapse outside of formal treatment might be characterized as involving alternative-reinforcement loss (e.g., changes in social or vocational circumstances). Because typical animal models of relapse do not examine the role of loss of alternative non-drug reinforcement, our laboratory developed the resurgence model of relapse to alcohol seeking. In this model, self-administration is established and then suppressed via extinction while an alternative non-drug reinforcer is made available. Relapse to alcohol seeking then occurs when responding for the non-drug reinforcer is also extinguished. But, a common criticism of typical animal models of relapse, including the resurgence model, is that abstinence is achieved by extinguishing self-administration?a feature that does not correspond to the human condition. Rather, it appears that escalating negative consequences encountered as a result of continued use are a major contributor. Accordingly, increasing effort is being directed at using negative consequences to suppress alcohol and drug seeking in animal models of relapse. Such methods have been successfully applied to study relapse of alcohol seeking induced by an alcohol-associated context (i.e., renewal). The goal of this R21 Exploratory/Developmental grant is to develop a behavioral procedure for use as an animal model of relapse to alcohol seeking induced by loss of alternative non-drug reinforcement following the use of escalating negative consequences to generate alcohol abstinence. By developing a version of the resurgence procedure using escalating negative consequences to suppress alcohol seeking, the proposed research could result in a more appropriate animal model for future examinations of behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms of relapse to alcohol seeking. Finally, by using both male and female rats the project will provide important information about potential sex differences in sensitivity of alcohol seeking to escalating negative consequences and the availability and then loss of alternative non-drug reinforcement."
"9481178","PROJECT SUMMARY  Adolescence is a vulnerable time period in which drug use can have lasting negative consequences into adulthood. However, the biology underlying this vulnerability, and how drugs modify the brain during adolescence, is unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear if males and females are equally vulnerable to drug use during adolescence, and if their vulnerability is due to the same molecular processes. One critical cell type that has been implicated in playing a role in this adolescent critical period is the resident immune cells of the brain, microglia. This project will explore the role of microglia in a brain region critically influenced by drugs of abuse, the nucleus accumbens (NAc), in male and female rats. To that end, I will first characterize what molecular processes to which microglia contribute that shape the development of the NAc during adolescence. Building upon this, I will next assess how adolescent drug use modifies function of microglia in these natural processes. Finally, I will determine the behavioral relevance of these observations by targeting microglia-dependent processes previously identified during adolescent NAc during drug use. Moreover, because all experiments will be performed in both male and female rats, this project is poised to determine if there is a sex-dependent regulation of molecular processes vulnerable to drug use. I expect this project to have several novel implications by bridging three bodies of research that are as yet considered disparate: (i) the molecular processes underlying vulnerability to addiction, (ii) neuroimmune responses to drugs of abuse, and (iii) the biology of relapse after long periods of abstinence."
"9417871","Project Summary This project follows up on our recent research implicating the neurotransmitter dopamine signaling as key mediator of circadian timing systems. Our main hypothesis is a subpopulation of dopaminergic neurons send signals to a population of dopamine type 1 receptor 1 (D1r)-expressing neurons in the dorsal striatum, constituting a critical link between food intake and circadian rhythms of daily activity. To address this hypothesis we propose to generate several genetically modified mice and test their behavioral and physiological entrainment to scheduled feeding. These results will expand our understanding of how the downstream targets of dopamine neurons control several important aspects of feeding related behaviors. In addition, since there are numerous dopaminergic drugs available, this research may suggest potential therapeutic strategies to target diseases associated with over- and under-eating.  "
"9451932","Abstract:  Using a mouse model of hepatitis B virus (HBV), the goals of this proposal are to determine: 1) how group 3 innate lymphocytes (ILC3s) contribute to HBV disease pathogenesis and 2) whether age plays a role in ILC3 function during an HBV immune response. The first portion of this proposal focuses on studying how HBV pathogenesis is affected by ILC3-deficiency through monitoring serological markers of HBV clearance and persistence, measuring the strength and diversity of effector T cell responses, evaluating the extent and quality of B cell responses and assessing lymphoid organization in the liver. The role of specific ILC3-derived cytokines will also be investigated by blocking their signaling during HBV-induced immunity to determine which ILC3 effector molecules contribute to ILC3 function in the liver. The second part of this proposal focuses on quantifying and qualifying age-dependent differences in hepatic ILC3s in an effort to better understand how age directs human HBV pathogenesis. This will be accomplished by measuring the expression of key cytokines and surface molecules in liver ILC3s over time during the initiation of an immune response to HBV in adult and young mice, as well as investigating the impact that ILC3 stimulation has on HBV pathogenesis in an age-dependent manner. Finally, age-dependent patterns of ILC3s identified in the mouse model will be compared to adult and infant human liver biopsies to determine the relevance of these findings in humans.  Information gathered from this proposal will represent significant progress towards understanding how immunity is orchestrated in the liver. It is clear that the liver employs unique strategies for determining self versus non-self due to the constant influx of non-self antigens from commensal organisms in the intestines, particularly at an early age when the GI tract is undergoing microbial colonization. Hepatitis B virus research shows that while the immune response in adults is often effective in controlling HBV infection, infants' and young children's immune responses in the liver are ineffective at clearing the virus, often leading to persistent infection. Thus, it is critical that we characterize age-dependent differences within the liver that direct effective versus ineffective immunity so that we can identify better therapeutic targets for the millions of patients living with chronic HBV. Defining the role of ILC3s in HBV pathogenesis is one step toward this goal and is essential for a comprehensive understanding of hepatic immunity. These studies will also garner insight on the greater role of ILC3s during infection and provide clues as to why these cells are most important in tissues that experience high microbial exposure."
"9521817","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and permanent disability in the United States affecting more than 1.7 million individuals each year. TBI not only results in tissue damage and cell death, but can perturb surviving neuronal function, leading to alterations in neural connectivity, abnormal plasticity, and network dysfunction. Due to the inherent diversity in post-TBI dysfunction, a critical need exists for therapeutic interventions that target multiple injury mechanisms. Development of such multi-prong therapeutic approaches could have enormous clinical, social, and economic benefit. However, implementation of this strategy requires the identification of endogenous molecular cascades capable of regulating multiple protective/restorative pathways. The discovery that the Rit GTPase (RIT1) is dramatically down-regulated following cortical contusion injury (CCI) prompted studies to explore the contribution of Rit-directed signaling to functional recovery following TBI. Drawing upon a collection of RIT1 transgenic mice, exciting preliminary data demonstrate that Rit activation reduces in vivo neurodegeneration and alleviates cognitive dysfunction following CCI. Additional data suggest that Rit is critical for post-TBI neurogenesis and promotes synaptic integrity by reducing post-contusion synaptic loss. Collectively these data are the first to demonstrate a significant role for Rit in directing neuroprotection and neuroplasticity following TBI, and suggest that Rit functions as a linchpin regulator of multiple injury response mechanisms following CCI. The overall hypothesis is that: (1) Rit plays a key role in cellular and functional recovery from brain trauma, and (2) that activation of Rit signaling therefore has broad therapeutic potential in the setting of TBI. Three complementary aims guide our studies. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that contusion-dependent Rit loss disrupts gene expression programs that promote neural survival and neurogenesis. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the extent to which Rit signaling controls neuronal survival after contusive brain injury. The efficacy of Rit-targeted therapies will be evaluated using an inducible knock-in mouse model to permit Rit activation over a clinically relevant period of hours to days after the onset of brain injury. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that Rit signaling preserves synaptic function following traumatic brain injury using transgenic mice, electrophysiology, and biochemical assays. Overall, these studies are expected to identify Rit as a crucial signal integration hub in the setting of brain injury ? orchestrating diverse endogenous pathways that regulate neuronal survival, promote neuronal regeneration, and control neuroplasticity mechanisms."
"9416902","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the years we have been characterizing mice with different Akt isoforms deficiencies for survival, lifespan, and susceptibility to cancer. The current renewal application is focused on new and unexpected observations made during the last funding period. These observations are: (i) Systemic whole body deletion of Akt1 in adult mice inhibits tumor progression in a mouse cancer model that is not driven by Akt activation. (ii) The deletion of either Akt1 or Akt2 does not inhibit liver carcinogenesis, and Akt2 deletion increases lung metastasis induced by liver carcinogenesis. (iii) The deletion of both Akt1 and Akt2 in the liver induces spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). (iv) Germ line deletion of Akt1 and Akt3 causes embryonic lethality, but the systemic deletion of Akt1 and Akt3 in adult mice is well tolerated. (v) The deletion of Akt1 increases the lifespan of mice. (iv) The systemic deletion of Akt1 and Akt2 in adult mice induces rapid mortality. These findings suggest that drugs, which target predominately Akt1 and not Akt2 could be effective and well tolerated in cancer therapy. By contrast, drugs that effectively inhibit both Akt1 and Akt2 could be deleterious and pro-liver carcinogenesis. Since Akt activation is perhaps the most frequently event occurring in human cancers, and targeting Akt activation for cancer therapy is in progress, our studies should have a profound impact on cancer therapy. The overall goal of this project is to determine the physiological consequences of Akt deletion in the mouse and their underlying mechanisms with implications to cancer therapy."
"9541431","Despite extensive and ongoing efforts to improve our ability to detect and treat cancer, it remains a leading cause of death worldwide, and incidence is only expected to continue rising. Recent advancements in highthroughput omic profiling technologies have facilitated a more thorough understanding of tumor physiology, enabling rapid quantification of molecular-level features with sufficient detail and breadth to begin unraveling the underlying mechanisms that drive malignant transformation. However, the full potential of omics techniques cannot be accessed without the use of systems biology approaches that optimize the extraction of biologically meaningful information from these increasingly large and complex datasets. Using an integrative approach to map omics data to biomolecular networks, such as genome-scale metabolic models, protein-protein interaction networks, and transcription factor signaling networks, constitutes a more effective approach, and has been demonstrated to successfully elucidate novel and medically important features from omics datasets. We propose to employ integrative omics analyses to determine how changes in human metabolic and protein secretory processes drive malignant transformation, and how the tumor phenotype shapes these processes in return. Despite extensive efforts to characterize the individual components of the protein secretory pathway and their role in diseases such as cancer, studies treating these components as a connected, interacting system are lacking. The proposed work seeks to develop a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of the protein secretion pathway and its interactions with the metabolic network in the context of cancer by integrating multiple layers of top-down omics datasets with bottom-up biological networks. Results obtained from these studies will lead to new candidate biomarkers for use in patient stratification and disease diagnosis, reveal novel mechanistic information on cancer and tumor physiology, and provide new tools with which human omics datasets can be processed. Approaches and tools developed for these efforts will have broad application to other diseases and biological systems, and will help drive the shift in healthcare toward personalized medicine."
"9418537","Administering aerosols to the lungs via the nose, while convenient, is known to be challenging due to high aerosol depositional losses in the delivery system and extrathoracic airways. In the first phase of this project, we demonstrated that the new excipient enhanced growth (EEG) technique could significantly improve lung delivery efficiency of aerosols administered during non-invasive ventilation and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy. The EEG approach implements a small particle aerosol containing a hygroscopic excipient to reduce depositional loss in the delivery system, increase aerosol particle size in the airways, and target the site of deposition within the lungs. Using EEG, lung delivery efficiency values were increased from ~1-10% to ~80% together with improved targeting of the small tracheobronchial airways (30-40-fold dose increase) and reduced intersubject variability. These results were based on testing in realistic in vitro airway models and new whole-airway computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.  The goal of this translational project is to determine the in vivo lung delivery efficiency of EEG aerosols administered during HFNC therapy using a newly developed and optimized HFNC aerosol delivery unit. A new standalone HFNC therapy aerosol device (delivery unit) will be developed that can simultaneously generate and administer an EEG aerosol. Depositional loss of the medication in the new delivery unit and streamlined nasal cannula interface combined will be <10% of the nebulized dose. Radiolabeled conventional and EEG formulations for mesh nebulization will be developed for human subject testing. The expected lung delivery efficiency of 1-10% with a commercial system will be increased to 80% or greater with the new EEG clinical system. In the human subject study, SPECT-CT images of the lung deposition will be segmented using 2D and 3D approaches and compared with CFD predictions. To accomplish these project goals, the following Aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1. Develop a HFNC aerosol delivery unit for nose-to-lung aerosol administration and optimize performance using concurrent in vitro tests and whole-airway CFD simulations. Specific Aim 2. Characterize the in vitro performance of the radiolabeled aerosol generated using the EEG method and delivery unit and the standard of care method to establish human subject dosimetry. Specific Aim 3. Conduct human subject testing of the HFNC aerosol delivery unit and compare delivery efficiency with current standard of care. Validate whole-airway predictions of the CFD model, and further optimize device performance. Impact. This project will provide a new technique (EEG) and clinical platform (HFNC delivery unit) for high efficiency aerosol delivery, low intersubject variability, and targeted delivery within the lungs for improving the efficacy of existing and new inhaled medications administered using the convenient nose-to-lung route."
"9415035","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The low number of college graduates from underrepresented (UR) groups in Arkansas, together with the low national number of UR students who graduate in the biological sciences and public health, result in a small pool of students entering the field of biomedical research. To address this shortfall, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) created the UAMS Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) Program in 2009 to provide UR students pursuing biomedical doctoral degrees with 2 years of salary/tuition, mentoring, and other student development activities with funds from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS). The UAMS IMSD Program has had a significant impact on UR enrollment in the doctoral programs. In 2008, the average UAMS enrollment of UR students in biomedical sciences doctoral programs was 6.1%, which trailed the then national average of UR student enrollment in all biological sciences of 8.2%. Currently, the average UR member enrollment rate in UAMS doctoral programs is 15.3%, 4.6 percentage points above the national average of 10.7% UR graduate students. The overall goal of the UAMS IMSD program is to improve upon the success UAMS has had in recruiting and retaining UR students during the first 4 years of the IMSD Program. We will do this by implementing our specific measureable objectives that aim to increase UR doctoral student enrollment in the biomedical sciences to 20% and boost the number of UR students graduating with biomedical science doctorate degrees to 20% of total UAMS biomedical doctoral graduates by 2019. These objectives align with the NIH-MBRS goals of increasing the number of UR students graduating from doctoral programs in the biomedical sciences at institutions with a research intensive environment and reducing the PhD completion gap between UR and non-UR students in the biomedical sciences. Our first Aim is to increase the number of UR student applicants to doctoral programs in the biomedical sciences by 50% by 2018. We will accomplish this by increasing our recruiting activities and enlarging our capacity to measure the results of these activities and subsequently revise our strategies. Aim 2 is to retain and graduate 90% of the students in the IMSD Program. We will build on our past retention success by enhancing our PhD Summer Transition Program for matriculated students, expanding student development activities, enhancing retention activities, and advancing our mentoring plan. The final Aim is to evaluate the program and determine which factors contributed to successes and which areas need improvement, and disseminate the results. Program strategies and outcomes will be disseminated to the UAMS campus and other schools through newsletters, presentations, and publications. The initiatives proposed here can contribute to the global recruitment, retention, and graduation of all UR students at UAMS and provide lessons learned to other institutions, which will ultimately increase the numbers of UR faculty and investigators in the biomedical science workforce serving Arkansas and the nation."

"9523470","Abstract Ovarian cancer (OC) is deadly and incurable for patients that recur after primary cancer is treated with surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, OC has a high rate of disease recurrence (70-80%) and most recurrent tumors are chemoresistant. Currently, therapeutic options are quite limited for these patients, and thus unlike with other cancers, the mortality in OC has not improved in decades. This dreadful situation highlights a drastic need for new and improved therapeutics to eliminate and treat recurrent and chemoresistant disease. In this context our studies identified increased Hedgehog (Hh)/GLI signaling in chemoresistant OC cells and tumors, and GLI1 expression significantly correlated with upregulated FA-BRCA and homologous recombination (HR) genes, cancer stem cell signaling and poor prognosis of OC patients. Our preliminary data demonstrate that GLI1 regulates expression of DNA repair genes BRCA1, FANCD2 and RAD51 in OC cells and tumors and its inhibition induces a state known as ?BRCAness?, which is characterized by inefficient repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB). Additionally, Hh/GLI1 inhibition or downregulation decreased cell survival and ability to form tumor spheroids (stem cell characteristic), and enabled synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors. In this proposal we aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Hh/GLI1 regulates FA-BRCA and HR genes that promote oncogenic replication (Aim 1), and determine the efficacy of Hh/GLI1 inhibitors in both BRCA-proficient and deficient OC cells in cell line and ovarian cancer orthotopic mouse models (Aim 2). Towards the goal of identifying effective therapeutic combinations that work synergistically and induce synthetic lethality, we will evaluate effective therapeutic combinations involving Hh/GLI1 and PARP inhibitors. The most efficient drug combinations will be examined in a mouse orthotopic and patient derived xenograft models of OC to evaluate their efficacy in combatting acquired chemoresistance and OC disease progression (Aim 3). Chemotherapeutic drugs examined in this proposal are FDA approved or currently undergoing clinical and preclinical evaluation (ex. vismodegib, sonidegib, GANT61, olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib); thus, the effective drug combinations discovered can quickly be transitioned into clinical trials and developed into treatments for OC patients."
"9529862","Project Summary/Abstract We intend to leverage a unique model system developed in our laboratories to reproduce diverse ecosystems representing the human distal colon (DC) and use them to identify the role of the vast communities of viruses that inhabit the DC. Many of these viruses are bacteriophages that are postulated to play major roles in altering human bacterial communities, but until now there has been no available technology to assess their roles. Because bacteriophages kill their hosts or provide them with potentially beneficial gene functions, we hypothesize that they have a significant capacity to shape the human microbiome and potentially play a role in the maintenance of health and the development of disease. Our laboratories have pioneered technologies to characterize these viral communities, and have shown that viral communities are highly personal, persistent, host sex consistent, harbor genes involved in antibiotic resistance, and are readily transmissible between close contacts. We believe that the unique model ecosystems we have developed will allow us to reproduce the diverse and complex microbial ecology of the DC, and will play a critical role in helping to decipher the role of the viral communities that inhabit the human DC. We now know that bacteria in the gut play significant roles in human health and disease, yet the forces that shape the gut microbiome are still being uncovered. Much of the diversity in the DC can be grouped into distinct enterotypes; these groups are driven by the relative abundances of microbes such as Bacteroides in different individuals. Our model system simulates the diverse DC microbiota, and is the first model capable of recapitulating the enormous microbial diversity of the DC. The system incorporates bile salts, mucins, and starches to create an environment suitable for DC bacteria. Another major benefit of this system is its accurate reproduction of viral communities from the DC. We hypothesize that the use of this model system will allow us to directly test the impacts of virus-mediated perturbations on different enterotypes. The proposed studies will help decipher the impacts of viruses on the diversity and taxonomy of gut enterotypes, and determine whether virus-mediated perturbations result in enterotype switching. Our aims are as follows: Aim 1) Establish model systems representing different distal colon enterotypes, and Aim 2) Characterize the responses of cultured communities to virus-mediated perturbations. We believe that through the development of our model DC ecosystem, we can address fundamental questions about the roles of viruses in the human microbiome, including: 1) how do viral communities impact our DC microbiomes?, 2) are viruses important determinants of DC microbial ecology?, and 3) how do viruses from individuals with different enterotypes affect one another? We believe the proposed research is a critical first step in understanding how viral communities may be used to manipulate the human microbiome."
"9498585","Summary Despite recent progress in reducing severe disease in sub-Saharan Africa, malaria remains one of the largest global public health burdens and a leading cause of mortality in children in low and middle income countries. There is an urgent need for an effective malaria vaccine because resistance has emerged to every antimalarial drug that has been publicly released to date. Vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum, the major cause of malaria in Africa, have received extensive support and are showing encouraging signs, but vaccine research for Plasmodium vivax, the major cause of malaria outside of Africa, has to date been extremely limited. This proposal will use the lessons from P. falciparum vaccine development, which for too long focussed on a limited number of candidates and did not make use of the full depth of available genomic sequence information. The central objective is to carry out the first comprehensive reverse vaccinology assessment of P. vivax blood stage antigens, combining advanced genomic and cellular techniques with ex vivo phenotyping assays. An established eukaryotic protein expression system will be used to express a library of >200 P. vivax blood stage vaccine candidates, which will be selected based on gene expression, biophysical characteristics and genomic diversity criteria. All expression constructs will be made freely available to the research community to aid global P. vivax vaccine and biology research efforts. The expressed proteins will be screened for antibody binding to confirm correct folding, and used in erythrocyte and receptor binding assays to prioritise targets for further study. Polyclonal antibodies will be raised against 100 targets and used in ex vivo P. vivax invasion phenotyping assays, to identify antibodies that block parasite invasion or growth. P. vivax parasites from both South America and Southeast Asia will be used at this stage of screening, introducing antigenic diversity at the earliest stage of target prioritization, another important lesson from P. falciparum vaccine development where strain-specific inhibitory responses derailed several promising candidates. Antibodies that provide cross- strain inhibition will be tested in combination to identify >4 highly effective and synergistic candidates for future development and potential clinical testing. The proposal will radically change the scale and pace of P. vivax vaccine development, and will produce resources of broad utility to the malaria research community."
"9413197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an established relationship between anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Following injury and surgical reconstruction, OA is reported in the medial compartment of the involved knee in 30 to 60% of patients within five to eight years. While increased muscle co-contraction often occurs in the unloaded knee, more detailed biomechanical analysis from our lab has shown that the involved knee undergoes unloading in the medial compartment. That is, the compressive joint contact force in the medial compartment of the involved knee is less than in the uninvolved knee during gait. The unloading is observed immediately after injury and is still quite pronounced at six months, but loading returns to normal two years after ACL reconstruction. However, differences in loading between impaired and unimpaired limbs at six months post-surgery is correlated with OA development 5 years post-surgery. In this study, we will examine the biomechanical and biochemical basis for this by studying people at 3 months, 6 months and 2 years following ACL reconstruction. In the first aim, we will explore the biomechanical basis of this unloading using EMG and gait analysis techniques, couple with the use of a biomechanical model that will allow joint contact force estimation. In Aim 2, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of the knee will be used to discern biochemical changes in the cartilage during the post-surgery period (same three time points). T1? and T2 relaxation time quantification (indicative of glycosaminoglycan loss and decreased collagen matrix organization) will be performed for each limb. In Aim 3, we will examine the effect of knee loading differences on knee cartilage stress distribution, using a finite element model. This will enable us to determine how the loading and biochemical changes influence the pressure in the cartilage. We believe that these aims will enable us to understand the mechanisms governing knee unloading following ACL reconstruction and will enable us to make recommendations for clinical treatment paths to avoid subsequent OA development in this population."

"9414651","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cells become more susceptible to disease as they age, and thus understanding the fundamental molecular mechanisms that regulate aging is important to public health. Aging cells undergo profound shifts in gene expression that are regulated, in part, by epigenetic changes. These epigenetic alterations include histone methylation and acetylation as well as cytosine methylation. The modified epigenetic state results in the expression of genes needed for protection during cell death (antioxidant genes) as well as inappropriate expression of normally silenced regions. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate the importance of epigenetic changes that accompany leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana. Specific aims include the analysis of potential regulatory genes that show both an increase in gene expression and a gain in the histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) mark to determine if primary response genes are marked by H3K4me3. Critical histone modifiers will be identified by genetic analysis using altered gene expression as the selective criteria. In addition, the loss of cytosine methylation during aging will be tested for u-regulated genes and one up-regulated transposon. Although the model organism is a plant, many of the same protective genes (i.e. glutathione) are expressed in plants and animals, and silencing of repetitive DNA regions is essential for the genome integrity of both plants and animals."
"9545982","Project Summary Exosomes are from the intraluminal vesicles (ILV) of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) produced via endocytic process. Mature MVBs can fuse with lysosomes to deliver their contents for degradation and recycling or fuse with the plasma membrane where ILVs are released as exosomes. Recent studies have indicated that enhanced exosome excretion in arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is an essential mechanism triggering or promoting calcifying nidus formation and extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization in the arterial wall under different pathological conditions. However, little is known so far how MVB fate and exosome excretion are controlled by lysosomes in SMCs and whether lysosomal dysfunction increases exosome excretion from SMCs to activate or accelerate vascular calcification process. The present grant proposal will test a central hypothesis that lysosomal acid ceramidase (AC)-mediated sphingolipid metabolism plays a crucial role in the control of lysosome trafficking or fusion to MVBs and subsequent exosome excretion, maintaining the normal phenotype and function of SMCs. AC gene defect or functional deficiency may disturb lysosome degradation of MVBs, increasing exosome excretion and resulting in calcifying nidus formation and ultimate vascular calcification under pathological conditions. To test this hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether exosome excretion in arterial SMCs is fine controlled by lysosomal AC activity and whether the deficiency of this AC regulation causes arterial calcification in smooth muscle-specific AC gene knockout mice (Asah1fl/fl/SMcre) with analysis of exosomes, SMC phenotypes, and calcification in the arterial wall and cultured coronary arterial SMCs. Specific Aim 2 attempts to test whether lysosomal AC- mediated sphingolipid signaling regulates lysosome trafficking to and fusion with MVBs to limit exosome excretion from SMCs with gene deletion (Asah1fl/fl/SMcre), CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, and SM22? promoter- driven gene rescuing. In Specific Aim 3, we will address whether the AC regulation of lysosome trafficking or fusion to MVBs is attributed to its action on lysosomal TRPML1 channel activity and associated Ca2+ release using patch clamping of isolated lysosomes and lysosome-specific Ca2+ imaging with GCaMP3-ML as an indicator. To our knowledge, these proposed studies will represent the first effort to investigate the lysosome regulation of exosome excretion from SMCs and associated pathogenic role in vascular calcification. The findings will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of arterial calcification and identify lysosomal AC as a therapeutic target for prevention or treatment of vascular calcification."
"9588851","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate navigation is thought to depend on neural representations of location and directional heading, which are carried by head direction cells, place cells, and grid cells. Head direction cells depend more heavily [than place cells] on signals  from the otolith organs, but no studies have investigated the otolithic contribution to grid cell activity. Spatial deficits associated with otolith dysfunction may therefore result from disrupted head direction and/or grid cell activity. The proposed studies will test the otolithic contributionto entorhinal cortical grid cell activity during visual and non-visual navigation tasks. Results will provide important insight into the roles of vestibular information in neural representations of space, and the roles of these representations in navigation. A thorough understanding of the vestibular contribution to neural representations of space may enable new treatment approaches for cognitive deficits resulting from vestibular pathology."
"9429078","Summary Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are the leading cause of cancer in HIV-infected individuals and recent epidemiologic data suggests that these cancers are occurring in increased frequency in patients treated with combination antiretroviral treatment (cART). The underlying rationale of this program is that viral and host long noncoding RNAs play a role in gamma-herpesvirus pathogenesis and tuomorigenesis. Recent investigations into the function of human lncRNA have begun to illustrate how central this class of RNAs is to an array of cell regulatory processes such as gene silencing, transcriptional activation, gene imprinting, RNA maturation, splicing, etc. Based on our recent EBV transcriptomics work, we believe that there are likely scores of novel viral lncRNAs (vlncRNAs) expressed in different stages of the EBV infection cycle. Collaborative efforts with the Renne and Tibbetts labs to globally identify and resolve viral transcript structures are similarly uncovering dozens of novel non-coding KSHV and MHV68 RNAs revealing common themes such as vlncRNAs that can act as microRNA sponges and latency gene antisense transcripts that potentially contribute to the regulation of latency and reactivation, two steps that are crucial for virus biology and pathogenesis. In Project 2, we will investigate the functions of three distinct vlncRNA types expressed from the oncogenic latency membrane protein LMP2 locus, the protein product of which is required for growth transformation of primary human B cells. One of these vlncRNAs is antisense to LMP2 and is an apparent counterpart of the KSHV LAMP antisense transcript being investigated in Project 1. We will also investigate a series of unique sense oriented LMP2 isoforms. This includes chimeric LMP2 transcripts harboring exons from the transforming latency vlncRNA, RPMS1 (a BamHI A Rightward Transcript (BART) isoform), as well as a circular form of LMP2. We hypothesize that these LMP2 transcripts have diverse functions ranging from chromatin remodeling to interactions with B-cell receptor signaling pathways in both reactivation and possibly de novo infection and growth transformation. Importantly, Project 2 will exploit EBV's ability to growth transform B-lymphocytes to directly address the roles of both vlncRNAs and EBV regulated cellular lncRNAs in B-cell activation and in HIV-associated lymphomas, complementing similar investigations being pursued in Projects 1 and 3."
"9445957","Abstract With the advent of personalized cancer medicine, mutations in tumors can be paired with targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, even the most potent TKI fail to eradicate all cancer cells. Subsequently, tumor-repopulating cells within minimal residual disease (MRD) contribute to patient relapse. The application of Abl-kinase inhibitors to the BCR/ABL oncoprotein in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a paradigm for personalized medicine. TKI therapy in CML leads to long lasting therapeutic benefit; however, MRD remains and can eventually evolve to blast crisis. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the failure of TKI to eradicate CML MRD are not known, growth factor signals are suspected to replace the TKI- disabled oncoprotein survival signals. We have determined that c-Fos and Dusp1 are critical for growth-factor- mediated TKI resistance. Both genetic and chemical inhibition of Dusp1 and c-Fos render CML exquisitely sensitive to TKI, and cure a mouse model of CML. Overall, our published and preliminary data suggests that expression levels of c-Fos and Dusp1 determine the threshold of TKI efficacy during chronic CML disease. Extending this line of investigation, the proposed research will determine whether c-Fos and Dusp1 are necessary and sufficient for the evolution of CML to blast crisis, and whether c-Fos and Dusp1 levels determine response to TKI in blast crisis. Next, we hypothesize that Fos and Dusp1 signals converge upon oncogenically-activated enhancers. We propose that Fos-Jun AP-1 complexes facilitate oncogenically active enhancers, while in the absence of c-Fos and Dusp1 signals, Jun-JunD AP-1 complexes predominate but do not support tumor maintenance. Specifically, we will molecularly link c-Fos-Jun AP-1 and Dusp1 activity to global enhancer chromatin dynamics. Moreover, we will exploit chromatin-embedded target-gene-reporter alleles to provide a detailed analysis of functionally-relevant downstream genes at a single-cell level in primary CML cells. The proposed work is expected to delineate the necessity of c-Fos and Dusp1 in CML-blast-crisis TKI sensitivity, as well as to provide deep molecular insight into the mechanisms underlying blast crisis and cytokine-mediated TKI resistance. We expect that this information will be informative not only for CML and blast crisis, but also the broad group of tyrosine-kinase oncoprotein-driven tumors that are not cured by TKI."
"9416090","SUMMARY Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the single largest viral cause of pediatric bronchiolitis and pneumonia, with a high worldwide mortality, and there is no safe and effective vaccine. Ever since the encounter with vaccine- enhanced disease (VED) during a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccination trial in the 1960s, it has been enormously challenging to impart both sufficient safety and efficacy in a single vaccine. For RSV-naïve children, live-attenuated vaccines are an important focus, because inactivated and subunit vaccines are poor at inducing cell-mediated immunity which contributes to VED. Moreover, live vaccines can induce broad systemic and local immunity. Thus, for RSV-naïve individuals a live vaccine approach is an attractive option, provided the vaccine itself is sufficiently safe and cannot revert to a more aggressive phenotype. It has recently been recognized that the viral fusion (F) protein is unstable and readily shifts to the post-fusion conformation during purification or vaccine preparation. As a result, a large proportion of vaccine-induced antibodies (Abs) target the post-fusion form, which is functionally obsolete. To avoid induction of anti- post- fusion F Abs, McLellan et al were able to genetically stabilize the pre-fusion form (referred to as FPRE), thereby greatly increasing neutralizing capacity of anti-F Abs, when given as a protein vaccine. However, subunit vaccines are deemed unsafe for the RSV-naïve target population. Thus, to protect RSV-naïve children there is a need to place the advantageous pre-fusion F concept in the context of a balanced immune response that does not cause VED, which could be achieved by expressing FPRE from a live-attenuated virus. However, stabilization of FPRE renders it non-functional and a virus solely expressing FPRE is not viable. We previously reported a baculovirus GP64 based complementation system that can overcome this problem, as it uniquely allows generation of infectious F-deleted or F-compromised viruses from cDNA in GP64-expressing cells. These GP64-pseudotyped viruses could be amplified to high titer and were significantly more temperature stable than wildtype RSV. Due to replacement of functional F with trans-complemented GP64, the viruses are infectious but self-limited and cannot spread beyond initially infected cells, thus constituting an attractive live-attenuated platform. We have in vivo preliminary data using a similar single-round RSV vaccine that suggests such vaccines are efficaceous. The goal of this proposal is to exploit the GP64 system to generate a live RSV which solely expresses the pre- fusion F form. Our hypothesis is that replacing the native, functional, F gene with a gene encoding a pre-fusion stabilized F in a live virus, will drive the anti-F response toward the pre-fusion F form, and will induce a balanced response that includes cell-mediated immunity and avoids VED. We will test this hypothesis through two aims: 1) Generate and in vitro characterize a live-attenuated RSV lacking a functional F copy and expressing instead a conformationally stabilized pre-fusion F; and 2) Characterize immune properties of RSV expressing FPRE in vivo to assess safety and efficacy. If successful, the vaccine will exceed previous formulations in inducing a broadly efficaceous yet safe immune response for the RSV-naïve target population."
"9451643","William Hoffman, PhD, MD, PI: Neurobiology of Alcohol and Nicotine Co-Addiction OBJECTIVE: This proposal, Neurobiology of Alcohol and Nicotine Co-Addiction addresses the critical absence of information about the neurobiology of recovery from Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in alcohol (EtOH) and nicotine (NIC) using veterans. AUD and nicotine use disorder (NUD), almost entirely cigarette smoking, are the most commonly abused (non-prescription) substances in the U.S. Co-addiction is particularly high in military veterans. Although nationwide estimates peg the rate of AUD/NUD co-addiction at 80%, the Substance Abuse Treatment Program (SATP) at the Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS) finds that 90% of veterans treated for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) also meet criteria for Nicotine Use Disorder (NUD). PLAN: SA 1: Test a dual network model of alcohol and nicotine co-addiction via contrast of multiple neural aspects of AUD, NUD, NAUD and CS: a) task based (PDD) and stress modulated cue induced craving, b) volumetric estimates of cortical density (voxel-based morphometry [VBM], c) anatomical (diffusion tensor imaging [DTI] and d) resting state functional connectivity. SA 2: Develop a machine learning model that integrates behavioral, task and resting state functional activation, volumetric data and structural connectivity that a) differentiates the four groups and b) predicts treatment outcome at 3 months. METHODS: Four subject groups (Alcohol alone [AUD] alcohol plus smoking [NUD/AUD = NAUD], subjects who smoke [NUD] and never addicted controls [CS]) will be recruited from the Portland VA Health Care System (VAPORHCS). All will undergo a comprehensive evaluation at baseline including neuroimaging, cognitive testing, careful demographic and substance use history and laboratory evaluation. The AUD and AUD/NUD groups will be followed and re-evaluated with the entire battery at three months with monthly appointments to monitor progress. We hypothesize that a support vector machine learning algorithm will be able to use the measures to classify subjects as AUD, NUD both or neither and that the algorithm will predict outcome (sobriety or relapse) at 3 months. RELEVANCE TO THE VA MISSION: AUD and cigarette smoking are the most common addictive disorders in veterans and co-addiction is the rule. This proposal will disentangle the neurobiological correlates of single and co-addiction to these substances and develop a model that can help predict treatment response. Key words: Alcohol, nicotine, co-addiction, outcome"

"9439849","According to NIEHS, ?It is imperative to develop methods to assess the health effects associated with complex exposures in order to minimize their impact on the development of disease.? NIEHS has held several meetings on mixtures, including the 2015 workshop on Statistical Approaches for Assessing Health Effects of Environmental Chemical Mixtures in Epidemiology Studies. Conclusions include the following. 1) An interdisciplinary perspective is needed, including insights from environmental epidemiology, statistics/mathematics, toxicology and exposure science. 2) Mixtures epidemiology has three key goals: a) identify components of a mixture contributing to the outcome; b) examine interactions between the components; c) construct summary measures of exposure where possible. 3) Different methods have different strengths and weaknesses that may be complementary. We propose to build upon three methods that performed well at the 2015 workshop: Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), exposure space smoothing (ESS) and weighted quantile sum regression (WQS). We will develop two complementary methods: 1) BKMR/ESS. We will expand and combine aspects of BKMR and ESS into one method that primarily addresses the first two goals: variable selection and interactions. Crucial aspects of our proposal are i) extension to binary health outcomes, the most common type of outcome data in epidemiology (the 2015 NIEHS workshop examined continuous outcomes); ii) variable selection using the hierarchical structures observed for correlations between exposures; iii) incorporation of toxicological information. 2) Single index model: We will evaluate a generalization of WQS, the single index model (SIM). SIM non-parametrically estimates a one-dimensional smooth function of a weighted sum of exposures. The weighted sum represents a summary measure of exposure (one based on toxicological principles), a third goal of mixtures epidemiology. Following method development, we will test the methods using both synthetic and real world data sets, including the Environment And Reproductive Health (EARTH) cohort study. We will incorporate causal inference tools such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). For example, correlated exposures (co-exposures) are confounders under some DAGs and colliders or intermediate variables under others. This must be taken into account in both generation of synthetic data and proper interpretation of results. The specific aims of this project are as follows: Specific Aim 1: Combine features of BKMR and ESS to produce a method for analyzing epidemiologic data that incorporates toxicological information; can handle continuous, binary and repeated measures outcome data; select important exposure variables; flexibly model and examine interactions; adjust for confounders; is robust to influential points; Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the single index model (SIM) as a method for analyzing epidemiologic mixtures data and generating exposure summary measures; Specific Aim 3: Make benchmark synthetic data and method computer code publicly available. ! 1!"
"9419169","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Giardiasis, the disease caused by the eukaryotic parasite Giardia lamblia, is the most common intestinal parasitic disease in the U.S. and a major cause of morbidity in children throughout the world; estimates indicate 280 million cases of Giardia annually. Newly emerging drug-resistant strains are proving difficult to treat, and the front-line treatment, metronidazole, has a high incidence of side effects. Therefore, there is a critical need for anti-Giardia drugs that target novel molecular pathways. Giardia belongs to one of the earliest diverging groups of eukaryotes and is therefore quite divergent from metazoans. Opportunities for developing targeted therapeutics exist within this divergent biology. This proposal explores the biology of Rho family GTPases in Giardia. These proteins act as molecular switches that control essential cellular processes. Giardia contains a single Rho family GTPase homolog, gRac, previously demonstrated to play a conserved role in regulating polarity, membrane trafficking, and the cytoskeleton, all of which are essential to viability and pathogenesis. Functional assays have demonstrated that gRac plays a role in cyst formation. This process requires pulsed production, processing, and secretion of cyst wall protein (CWP) to make environmentally resistant cysts and is the only known regulated secretory pathway in Giardia. Rho GTPases are known to regulate ER-Golgi transport and secretory events in plants and animals. How CWP secretion is triggered in Giardia remains enigmatic, yet gRac is a likely candidate for regulating this process. Aim 1 of this proposal identifies the specific role of gRac n infectious cyst formation by following cyst wall markers through the secretory process. Also unknown is how gRac signaling is linked to downstream processes, previously unidentified downstream effectors (Giardia-specific or potentially ancient and undiscovered) are hypothesized to link gRac signaling to the cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. Using affinity purification and mass spectroscopy, 199 putative gRac interactors were identified. Aim 2 proposes to validate four of these gRac interactors as downstream effectors of membrane trafficking and/or the cytoskeleton through microscopy and knockdown studies. Upstream of gRac is a set of six gRac modulators that act to activate or inhibit gRac signaling. Aim 3, proposes to determine their contribution to gRac signaling and identify specific biological roles for each modulator using a combination of depletion studies and assays to measure cell proliferation, parasite attachment, and the ability to form infectious cysts. The proposed experiments are expected to define the central role of gRac in Giardia biology and pave the way toward discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Furthermore, because the Giardia genome contains only a single Rho GTPase and a handful of upstream modulators, the system is highly tractable and may uncover fundamental biology that has been obscured by the more complex signaling systems found in model eukaryotes."
"9440068","  Epidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is among the most frequent of cancers. It is treated by surgical excision, but the recurrence and metastatic rates approach 10%. Our scientific premise is that human epidermal cancer stem (ECS) cells are formed early in skin cancer and these cells are important cancer prevention targets. An important goal in this context is identifying and inhibiting activity of key proteins that are elevated and essential for ECS cell survival. Of particular interest, we show that tissue transglutaminase (TG2), an emerging cancer stem cell survival regulator, is highly elevated in ECS cells as compared to non- stem cancer cells. Of further importance, TG2 knockdown or treatment with sulforaphane (SFN), a promising diet-derived cancer prevention agent, reduces TG2 activity which is associated with reduced ECS cell survival and additional new studies indicate that TG2-knockout markedly reduces ECS cell tumor formation. We also provide new data suggesting that SFN covalently modifies TG2 to shifts its structure to an open inactivate conformation. These novel findings suggest that SFN treatment converts TG2 from a closed (GTP binding, signaling) pro-ECS cell survival form to an open inactive conformation. Our goal is to characterize this unique regulation to provide new understanding of how SFN influences this important target. We will test the idea that SFN treatment may regulate TG2 structure via mechanisms that involve direct covalent modification, and study the role of TG2 as a mediator of SFN action and a SFN treatment target in cultured ECS cells and tumors."
"9529978","Lassa virus (LASV) is a highly prevalent arenavirus in West Africa, where it infects several hundred thousand people annually, resulting in a high number of Lassa fever (LF) cases, a hemorrhagic fever (HF) disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. The impact of LF in human health led to its inclusion on the WHO list of top Priority Diseases in 2017. Moreover, LASV poses a credible threat to biodefense readiness. There are not FDA-licensed LASV vaccines and current anti-arenaviral therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective. Live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) are the most feasible approach to control HF arnaviruses within their endemic regions. The LAV Candid#1 (Can) strain of the arenavirus Junin (JUNV) has been shown to be a safe and effective vaccine to protect humans against Argentine HF caused by JUNV. The central goal of this exploratory R21 grant application is to leverage the established safety record and efficacy in humans of Can, together with our expertise in arenavirus reverse genetics to generate recombinant Can (rCan) expressing LASV antigens (rCan/lasvAg) to test the hypothesis that r3Can/lasvAg represent a novel approach to develop a safe and effective LAV to combat LF. To test our hypothesis we propose to complete the following specific aims (SA): SA 1. Generation and characterization of r3Can expressing LASV antigens (r3Can/lasvAg): We will rescue r3Can/lasvAg expressing NP* or GPC*, or both, LASV antigens known to induce protective immune responses against LASV. NP* contains mutation D478A to prevent its interference with the activity of Can vRNP, whereas GPC* corresponds to a stabilized pre-fusion form that is not incorporated into infectious particles, but predicted to induce a strong neutralizing and protective Ab response against LASV. We will characterize r3Can/lasvAg growth properties in cultured cells and virulence in mice. We will test the hypothesis that r3Can/lasvAg grow to titers compatible for vaccine production but are attenuated in vivo. SA 2. Assess r3Can/lasvAg safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice: We will assess r3Can/lasvAg safety in IFN- a/bg R KO B6 mice, which are highly susceptible to JUNV. We will evaluate immunogenicity of r3Can/lasvAg by examining both T-cell responses and production of virus-specific antibodies in immunized B6 mice. We will determine r3Can/lasvAg protective efficacy by challenging r3Can/lasvAg immunized B6 mice with rVSV expressing LASV NP and GPC antigens. We will test the hypothesis that r3Can/lasvAg are safe and able to induce LASV antigen-specific protective immunity. SA 3. Determine the stability of r3Can/lasvAg in cultured cells and in vivo: We will test the hypothesis that r3Can/lasvAg are phenotypically and genetically stable during multiplication in cultured cells and in vivo."
"9415546","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lipid peroxidation leads to the formation of oxidation specific epitopes (OSEs) that are proinflammatory and, unless they are removed, cause extensive cell damage. OSEs are present in oxidized low density lipoproteins (OxLDLs) and on the surface of apoptotic cells and cleared by binding to scavenger receptors (SRs) on macrophages. Persistence and/or excessive amounts of OSEs overwhelm the defense mechanisms against them. Additionally, the inflammatory response initiated by SR activation leads to tissue damage that becomes pathogenic in several diseases, including atherosclerosis. Natural antibodies (nAbs) produced by B1 cells of the innate immune system recognize OSEs and block their adverse effects. Epidemiologic evidence in humans as well as mechanistic studies in mice indicate that the OSE-rich OxLDLs are a pathogenic factor in both atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. Phosphocholine in oxidized phospholipids (PC-OxPL) forms OSEs that are recognized by several SRs including ScrB1 and by the nAb E06 IgM. Transgenic mice expressing a single chain (scFv) form of the antigen-binding domain of E06 IgM (E06-scFv) are protected against atherosclerosis induced by high fat diet (HFD) because the transgene prevents the binding of OSEs to macrophages and activation of inflammatory pathways. We have found that transgenic mice expressing E06-scFv have increased trabecular bone mass, accompanied by an increase in bone formation rate. The E06-scFv transgene also prevents the cortical bone loss caused by HFD by increasing endosteal osteoblast number and bone formation. E06 IgM prevents the negative effects of OxLDL on proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cultured osteoblastic cells. Our findings suggest that anti-OSE antibodies promote bone anabolism by preventing the negative effects of OSEs on osteoblasts and bone formation. Moreover, the level of anti-PC IgM (which includes E06) declines with age in mice, in association with a decline in bone mass. We hypothesize that increased production of OSEs due to accelerated apoptosis, oxidative stress, or chronic inflammation, in concert with inadequate levels of anti-OSE antibodies, contributes to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Studies proposed in this application will establish the cellular mechanisms of the bone anabolic effect of the E06-scFv transgene using DXA, microCT, histomorphometry, and measurement of inflammatory cytokines. Changes in the number and characteristics of osteoclast and osteoblast progenitors will be analyzed, in part by use of a novel FACS approach to study fluorescently labeled osteoprogenitors. The mechanisms by which the E06-scFv transgene attenuates HFD- induced bone loss will be further explored and the ability of this transgene to prevent the bone loss caused by old age will be determined. In addition, we will investigate whether OSEs negatively affect osteoblasts by binding to ScrB1, the most abundant SR for PC-OxPL in osteoblasts. Successful completion of this work should elucidate a previously unappreciated role of OSEs and anti-OSE antibodies in bone homeostasis and may suggest a novel therapeutic approach for the management of osteoporosis and atherosclerosis simultaneously."
"9444579","Kidney stones are a common and recurrent disease affecting more than 10% of Americans in their lifetime, but the underlying pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. Since kidney stones occur predominantly during middle age and affect more men than women, US veterans are a high risk group for this disease. Current therapies have limited effectiveness, with only a modest reduction in stone recurrence rates, and there has been no real advancement in preventive therapy for many years. A breakthrough in understanding is clearly needed. Stones form as aggregates of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals with layers of organic material, principally urinary proteins, between the individual crystals, and these proteins likely play a critical role in stone formation. The role of proteins in stone formation is obscured by the large number of urinary proteins found within stone matrix. Comparison of urine proteomes from stone forming and normal individuals has failed to identify critical protein differences to date, but our recent Preliminary Data comparing the relative abundances in proteins in CaOx stone matrix to their urinary abundances has highlighted 2 small subsets of proteins that are likely to be key proteins, specifically including both highly anionic and highly cationic proteins. Such a combination of proteins suggests a role for polyanion-polycation aggregates in triggering stone formation, because we have previously shown that such aggregates stimulate CaOx crystal nucleation and aggregation. Therefore, we hypothesize that the relative abundance of proteins critical to the stone forming process will be increased in CaOx stone matrix compared to that seen in freshly voided urine from the same patient, specifically including both highly anionic and cationic proteins. While the proposed experiments will not elucidate the mechanism whereby these specific proteins become enriched in CaOx stone matrix, confirming the presence of this specific protein mixture in a large number of stones is necessary before mechanistic based studies exploring our suggested link between protein aggregation and stone formation are relevant. The proposed work will identify and characterize key proteins in stone formation in two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will confirm enrichment of key proteins in stone matrix using quantitative mass spectrometry to determine the relative abundance of proteins in stone matrix and urine samples obtained from 40 CaOx stone forming patients. In Specific Aim 2, the relative abundances of key proteins in urine under stable health conditions will be compared between our stone former panel and a matching normal population to test for the expected increase in key protein abundance in stone former urine. Immunoblot techniques will be used to circumvent problems associated with quantitative mass spectrometry characterization of low abundance proteins. Identification of key proteins associated with CaOx stone formation represents a new paradigm in stone research that can direct future mechanistic studies on protein triggers of stone formation, and hopefully inspire new therapeutic strategies."
"9406063","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application to renew our Global Infectious Disease Research Training (GIDRT) program at the University of Virginia will build upon our many lessons learned and track record working over many cycles of International Training and Research in Emerging Infectious Diseases (ITREID), Actions for Building Capacity (ABC) and GIDRT Fogarty support that has so greatly strengthened our research and training collaboration with the Federal University of Cear? (UFC) in Fortaleza, Brazil. This experience is the strong foundation for strengthening our collaboration with the University of Venda (UNIVEN), a model, innovative, former homeland university in Limpopo Province in the northeast of South Africa, near the borders with Zimbabwe and Mozambique. UNIVEN is clearly poised to become a world-class research, teaching and service university, much like UFC was in northeast Brazil 20 years ago. Furthermore, UNIVEN attracts graduate students from other southern African countries such as Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Like South Africa, these countries are also experiencing acute shortages of trained individuals to help seek solutions to their particular human development problems. We believe our experience and lessons learned in Brazil have begun to take root at UNIVEN. We also believe that the transfer of our GIDRT program from Brazil to South Africa provides an opportunity to firmly establish infectious disease training at a site with limited training opportunities, a large burden of diseas, and a small, but growing research infrastructure. At UNIVEN, we have, in close collaboration with Dr. Pascal Bessong, formerly a Fogarty-supported trainee who is now Chair of Microbiology at UNIVEN, developed a cutting edge research program as well as research infrastructure. We have achieved this in part through our collaborative major Malnutrition and Enteric Disease Network (MAL-ED) study. This project, funded by an award from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), has supported Dr. Bessong, as he has led the establishment of a major new site for study of diarrheal illnesses and their long-term consequences. Given this success, we are now poised to take intervention science - applying our best science to testing novel approaches to disease control and improving health - to a whole new level by linking the laboratory bench to the bedside to the community and, importantly in our model, to come back from the community to the bench to elucidate novel interventions."
"9428294","PROJECT SUMMARY Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an established precursor of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. To date, liver biopsy remains the only test available to detect the two diagnostic features of NASH: hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation, but it is limited by invasiveness and potential complications. The central hypothesis of this application is that magnetic resonance elastogram (MRE) can discriminate NASH from simple steatosis. The hypothesis is supported by strong preliminary data which show that with novel technological modifications, MRE can isolate imaging parameters that correlate with inflammation and ballooning. A single multiparametric test that combines inflammation and ballooning assessment by MRE, and steatosis measurement by MRI-proton density fat fraction has the potential to provide a comprehensive estimation of the 3 components of histologic NAFLD activity score (NAS) in one setting. The objective of this study is to determine and validate the diagnostic performance of this single multiparametric test (henceforth named Hepatogram) for the detection of NASH in human subjects. We will test the central hypothesis in 3 AIMs. In AIM 1 we will use a cohort of obese subjects scheduled for bariatric surgery to assess NASH histologically by liver biopsy obtained during bariatric surgery and noninvasively before surgery by Hepatogram. The imaging parameters of inflammation, ballooning and steatosis will be used to develop a statistical model to predict histologic NAS score. In AIM 2 we will validate this statistical model in an independent, non-bariatric NAFLD cohort, in whom NASH will be diagnosed by liver biopsy and assessed by Hepatogram. In AIM 3 we will examine the longitudinal diagnostic performance of Hepatogram in the detection of NASH regression after weight-loss interventions. We will reevaluate the bariatric cohort described in Aim 1, one year after bariatric surgery by assessing for NASH regression by Hepatogram and liver biopsy. The predictive performance of the statistical model developed in Aim 1 and validated in Aim 2 will be examined by comparing the predicted MRE-based change in NAS score to the change in histologic NAS. This proposal will apply technically innovative approaches to a large, rigorously characterized population with NAFLD to test the hypothesis that Hepatogram is an accurate imaging biomarker for NASH diagnosis, monitoring and response to interventions. Obviating the impractical need for liver biopsy to diagnose NASH before onset of fibrosis would positively impact the care of NAFLD patients. This work will be performed in an academically nurturing environment within Mayo Clinic. The candidate will be guided by a strong mentorship committee of experts in the areas that the candidate identified for necessary training. The candidate acquired a strong foundation in statistical skills in assessment of disease risk, prognostication and outcomes evaluation during her post- doctoral training. She now proposes to solidify her foundation and acquire a set of new and complementary skills necessary for an independent career in clinical research in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease."
"9518290","Abstract The SCN8A gene encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6 that is expressed in neurons throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. Nav1.6 is concentrated at the axon initial segment and nodes of Ranvier. Mutations of SCN8A affect many aspects of brain and peripheral nerve function. In 2012 we described the first mutation of SCN8A in a child with early onset epileptic encephalopathy. Since then more than 150 de novo missense mutations have been identified in this severe form of epilepsy (OMIM # 614558). Our functional characterization of 10 patient mutations demonstrated that gain-of-function mutations resulting in channel hyperactivity are the major pathogenic mechanism underlying SCN8A encephalopathy. We generated a mouse model of the first identified SCN8A mutation, p.Asn1768Asp, that is widely used for evaluation of therapeutic interventions. We will use this model to isolate a recently discovered genetic modifier that results in complete rescue of seizures and sudden death. We will also assess the pre-clinical effectiveness of antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi reagents that suppress the expression of the dominant SCN8A mutation in the N1768D mouse model. To explore the basis for the severe hypotonia associated with many SCN8A mutations, we have generated a new conditional mouse model with CRE-dependent expression of the more severe patient mutation p.Arg1872Trp. We will use this new model to examine the role of mutant Nav1.6 in specific subsets of neurons at varying stages of development. This conditional model will also be used to directly test the contribution of cardiac expression of hyperactive Nav1.6 to the risk of sudden death. These studies will provide new knowledge regarding pathogenic mechanisms underlying SCN8A encephalopathy, and will test the effectiveness of gene suppression as a therapeutic intervention for this severe neurological disorder."
"9415740","Breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among women in West Virginia/Central Appalachia. About one out of every three cancer deaths are linked to excess body weight and Appalachia and West Virginia have some of the highest rates of obesity in the country. Obese women (especially in postmenopausal women) have higher rates of breast cancer incidence, are less responsive to cancer therapy and have worse clinical outcomes than non-obese women. Leucine is an essential amino acid that is elevated in obesity and is required for the activation of Mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR), which is kinase that is critical for tumor growth. Breast cancer cells absorb extracellular leucine through L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 (LAT1). The expression of LAT1 is higher in breast cancer compared with normal breast tissue, and its expression is more highly expressed in more advanced cancers, indicating that it is associated with breast cancer progression. Identifying the regulation and function of LAT1- leucine signaling in breast cancer in obesity should foster new ways to suppress this disease in obesity. Our preliminary studies have uncovered that the adipocyte secretome upregulates the expression of LAT1 and mTOR1 activity in human breast cancer cells. Increases in the transcription and activity of LAT1 are driven by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the estrogen receptor (ER). Preventing leucine uptake has a marked inhibitory effect on breast cancer cell colony formation, which supports our hypothesis that leucine transporters are critical for breast cancer cell survival and proliferation. These findings provide the basis for our proposal that will establish the regulation and function of LAT1-leucine in breast cancer in obesity and its requirement for mTOR1 activity and tumor progression. In Aim 1, we will decipher the signaling pathways that activate leucine-mTOR signaling in breast cancer in response to obesity-associated hormone levels. Aim 2 will focus on elucidating the intracellular mechanisms by which obesity in vivo promotes breast cancer development and progression over long periods of time. These studies should lead to the development of new therapies that inhibit leucine-stimulated induction on mTOR1 to suppress breast cancer in obesity. In addition to increasing our understanding of obesity and breast cancer, participation in this COBRE project will allow me to receive intensive career and scientific mentoring while generating important novel data to attain my goal of becoming a successful independent investigator with NIH R01 funding."
"9438372","Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive forms of reward seeking that support drug abuse and obesity exact an enormous toll on individual and economic health. A mounting body of preclinical and clinical work demonstrates that the endocannabinoid system powerfully regulates the motivational impact of rewards. While pharmacotherapies targeting endocannabinoid function to treat disordered reward seeking are efficacious, this approach has been hindered due to non-specific drug actions and unacceptable side effects. Here, I aim to identify mechanisms by which endocannabinoids regulate reward seeking through interactions with dopamine system function to identify precise neuronal targets for future cannabinoid-based therapies. I will test the hypothesis that synthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol by dopamine neurons is required for dopamine neurons to encode the incentive value of reward-predicting cues and motivate reward seeking. This work will employ two cutting-edge techniques, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and optogenetics, paired with conditional and inducible mutagenesis to selectively target the enzyme responsible for 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis within dopamine neurons. Our ability to target dopamine neuron function in real-time during behavior and manipulate specific elements of the endocannabinoid system will provide novel information concerning how endocannabinoid signaling motivates reward seeking, potentially enabling the development of more targeted pharmacotherapies."
"9611415","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goals of this proposal are to: 1) Measure the prognostic impact of histologic grade (without and with computer assistance) of follicular lymphoma cases by comparing it with outcome measures; and 2) to develop a computer-assisted image analysis (CaIA) system to quantitatively assess the FL tumor microenvironment (TME); 3) Compare the effectiveness of combined prognostic measure incorporating grade (without and with computer assistance), TME parameters and existing FLIPI score. The proposed research aims to develop a clinically relevant, pathology-based prognostic model in FL utilizing computer image analysis to incorporate grade, tumor microenvironment (TME), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers. Due to the variable clinical course in FL and increasing treatment options, a prognostic index would allow therapies to be tailored to the patient. Patients with high risk disease may benefit form more intensive therapy, while patients with low risk disease may be appropriate for lower intensity therapy with a more favorable side effect profile. Furthermore, a prognostic index, which includes pathologic features, may ultimately become more relevant in the era of biologically targeted therapies. Our objective is to use advanced image analysis techniques to perform a quantitative and topographical study of the normal and tumor microenvironment and use this study as well as improved and consistent grading options in improving the current prognostic index. Our long-term goal is to translate the improved prognostic index results as better treatment options to FL patients. We plan to pursue the following three specific aims for this project: Specific Aim 1: Measure the prognostic impact of histologic grade (without and with computer assistance) of follicular lymphoma cases by comparing it with outcome measures; Specific Aim 2: Measure the impact of FL tumor microenvironment by comparing TME parameters with outcome measures; Specific Aim 3: Compare the effectiveness of combined prognostic measure incorporating grade (without and with computer assistance), TME parameters and existing FLIPI score. We have formed an experienced team with expertise in FL pathology and oncology, imaging and image analysis, observer studies and biostatistics. Successful completion of this project will exert a sustained and powerful impact on the field by the virtue of its development of a platform for researchers and clinicians to quantitatively and objectively evaluate FL TME, to improve the FL grading, and to incorporate these developments to form a better prognostic index. Microscopic image analysis software, which will be developed for quantification, will be usable for other diseases such as breast cancer, for which TME is also known to be an important predictor of clinical status. The software and data to carry out this project will be made freely available to the research community."

The objective of the GABC is to enable the genomic and bioinformatics research goals of this COBRE application and to assist other investigators in obtaining and analyzing genomic data. The GABC will provide the following five services to COBRE investigators: (1) high throughput Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in support of RNA-Seq and other global genomic studies, (2) bioinformatic methods and analyses for NGS projects, (3) automated Sanger DNA sequencing and RNA/DNA quality assessment, (4) access to critical shared instruments including real-time thermal cyclers, Luminex 200 system, Protein Simple Fluorimeter and SpectraMax plate reader and (5) workshops on NGS and bioinformatic methods central to the COBRE research projects. The GABC business model includes a full-service plan of operation for provision of NGS and other genomic services to the COBRE investigators. We anticipate that our full service model will encourage COBRE and other investigators to adopt genomic approaches in their research and that these interactions will promote the growth of GABC and genomic research in West Virginia. The GABC will enable COBRE investigators to identify and characterize candidate pathways that help to explain the role of transporters in the development of obesity. Our strategic plan and centralized expertise will improve the efficiency of the research process in terms of improved access and reduced time and cost of genomic data analysis. The long term impact of GABC participation will be to stimulate discovery of molecular mechanisms in chronic diseases prevalent in West Virginia."
"9436432","The ability of small interfering RNAs and microRNAs to silence the expression of specific genes is among the major biomedical discoveries of the last two decades. However the difficulty of delivering sufficient doses of these labile, hydrophilic macromolecules to disease sites continues to hamper the practical application of RNA interference in medicine. Two key problems are that (i) RNAi therapeutics lack inherent permeability across cellular membrane barriers and (ii) that they are rapidly degraded in the extracellular environment. To address these issues the major existing strategy is to encapsulate RNAi agents within protective nanoparticles that contain cationic components. However, the inherent toxicity of existing delivery vectors have limited the translational capacity of this approach in applications requiring systemic delivery. In contrast, nature has provided an elegant solution for delivering RNAi agents without damaging cellular membranes ? siRNA transport through the cellular gap junction network. Specifically, hexameric connexin channels imbedded in the plasma membranes of adjacent cells come together to form gap junctions, direct passageways between the cytoplasm of a cell and its neighbors, which cells use to share diverse hydrophilic molecules including siRNA. Recently, we have developed novel delivery systems that can harness the potential of the gap junction network. Here we propose to develop RNAi loaded connectosomes, lipid membrane vesicles that incorporate a high concentration of connexin membrane channels, creating a direct passageway from the interior of the vesicle to the cellular interior. Preliminary work demonstrates that using our novel connectosomes to deliver small molecule chemotherapeutics increases the efficiency of tumor cell killing by 1000 fold in comparison to conventional liposomal delivery, results which illustrate the importance of direct access to the cell cytoplasm. Further, we have demonstrated loading of connectsomes with siRNA and the release of siRNA into the cell cytoplasm. These findings, coupled with the well-established role of gap junctions in natural RNAi delivery, suggest our hypothesis ? particles that access the gap junction network can substantially increase the efficiency of siRNA delivery. Two aims will develop siRNA-loaded connectosomes and test their efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo models of breast cancer. Aim 1 is to perform an in vitro optimization of connectosomes for siRNA delivery and gene knockdown. These studies will utilize quantitative measures of siRNA loading, release, and resulting gene knockdown. Then Aim 2 is to perform an in vivo evaluation of the anti-tumor efficacy of siRNA and chemotherapeutics delivered using connectosomes. These studies will utilize a breast tumor xenograft model in mice. Harnessing the gap junction network to circumvent the endosomal pathway for delivery of siRNA and microRNA is highly innovative and has the potential to provide an entirely new route for transport of these potent therapeutics into the cytoplasm. This fundamental conceptual innovation in RNAi delivery will allow us to increase the efficiency and reduce the toxicity of siRNA therapeutics, helping to realize their potential for treatment of diverse diseases."
"9465004","Abstract Survival in a hostile environment requires the ability to assess potential threats and take the most appropriate defensive action. Accumulating evidence suggests that the amygdala is well positioned to integrate information about threats and to guide or shift responses along a spectrum of potential defensive behaviors. In both humans and mice, the amygdala plays an essential role in defensive responses to the threat of suffocation, signaled by rising systemic carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the body. Lesioning the amygdala, or manipulating it more precisely in other ways, reduces some defensive behaviors evoked by CO2 inhalation (e.g. freezing) while simultaneously increasing others (e.g. fight-or-flight). Because CO2 inhalation evokes a variety of defensive responses in a robust, reproducible, and concentration-dependent manner, CO2 provides a straightforward and translatable approach to studying the amygdala's role in defensive behavior regulation. In this application, we propose to study defensive behaviors evoked by CO2 using state-of-the-art, neuron- specific manipulations and electrophysiological recording to deconstruct roles of select neuron populations in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). We hypothesize that distinct defensive behaviors are differentially regulated by the BLA and that principal neurons and interneurons in the BLA each play unique roles. To test this hypothesis we will use genetic, optogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches to specifically activate and silence specific BLA neuron populations and quantify the effects on neural activity and defensive behaviors. Together these experiments will allow us to discern how these neurons regulate different defensive behaviors. Understanding basic mechanisms that guide or shift defensive behaviors along their spectrum will be essential for identifying abnormalities in these processes and for finding ways to correct them. This knowledge will ultimately impact mental illnesses where defensive behaviors are inappropriately extreme such as panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder."
"9557808","The long-term goal of this program is to develop our novel antimicrobial, teixobactin, into a therapeutic for treating a wide range of infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. The goal of this Phase IIB project is to complete preclinical development of teixobactin in preparation for clinical trials.  Using our iChip culturing technology, NovoBiotic has been exploiting previously uncultivable bacteria that make up 99% of all microorganisms for production of secondary metabolites. In 2015, NovoBiotic reported the discovery of teixobactin, the first member of a novel class of peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitors. Although teixobactin showed some favorable drug properties, it was found to gelate in serum or phosphate buffered saline, resulting in sporadic adverse effects in animals. Due to this narrow safety window, we decided to focus on a formulation screening program to prevent or significantly reduce this gelation property to minimize or eliminate the adverse effects. After screening over 800 potential vehicles and vehicle combinations, we developed a new formulation of teixobactin, using an FDA-approved vehicle, which reduces gelation in serum, shows no loss in potency against pathogens, is well tolerated in animals while providing blood levels far exceeding the MIC for several hours, and is highly efficacious in two validated mouse models of infection. The other aims of the Phase IIA grant that were not influenced by the formulation studies were fulfilled, such as improving the teixobactin fermentation yields 10-fold, and studying the postantibiotic effect of the compound.  The goal of this project is to advance the newly-formulated teixobactin through IND-enabling studies in preparation for clinical trials. This will include: (Aim 1) produce enough compound through fermentation to conduct all IND-enabling studies; (Aim 2) perform FDA-recommended in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) and GLP safety pharmacology studies, as well as a murine PK/PD study; (Aim 3) perform non-GLP and GLP toxicity studies in two species; (Aim 4) perform preformulation studies such as determining the stability, solubility and physicochemical properties of teixobactin as part of establishing the Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) parameters. With a successful Phase IIB program, we will have sufficient data to file an IND, and prepare for large-scale manufacturing and clinical trials."
"9420464","Project Summary Obesity is a disease that affects 33% of the US population, leads to the development of severe comorbidities such as diabetes, and results in overall poor quality of life. The development of obesity is influenced by many genetic, environmental, and cultural factors but ultimately is strongly dependent on caloric intake and diet. Gastrointestinal (GI) peptides and hormones are known to influence appetite, satiation, and energy expenditure through interactions with cognate receptors expressed in the brain or in peripheral nerve fibers making them an appealing therapeutic target for obesity treatment. Our laboratory has previously described a putative role for a particular GI peptide, peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), where application of PYY to the oral cavity in mice promotes decreased food intake and weight loss without causing conditioned taste aversion (Acosta et al 2012, Hurtado et al 2013). Notably, cognate neuropeptide Y receptors (YRs) for PYY have been detected in taste buds as well as receptors for leptin and GLP-1, two other pro satiety hormones (La Sala et al 2013, Shigamura et al 2004, Martin et al 2009). The discovery of satiety hormone receptors in taste buds is intriguing, specifically because of the influence of taste on both feeding behavior and caloric consumption. Based on preliminary RNA sequencing of the murine taste bud transcriptome conducted in our laboratory, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of murine circumvallate taste buds and discovered that key receptors for adiponectin (APN), Adipor1 and Cdh13, are expressed in PLC?+ taste receptor cells. This finding is significant because APN is a protein known to be down-regulated in obese humans and known to effect body weight and glucose homeostasis in mice (Arita et al 1999, Kubota et al 2002). In addition, APN is present in saliva as well as in the circulation although a specific role for salivary APN has yet to be identified. Using a behavioral brief-access taste response test in adiponectin null (APN-/-) mice, we have further discovered that these mice display an increased sensitivity to intralipid stimulus. Based on these results, we will first set to fully characterize the expression profile of Adipor1 and Cdh13 in murine circumvallate taste buds by performing dual IHC staining using antibodies for Adipor1 and Cdh13 as well as antibodies for established taste receptor cell markers. Next, we will assess the functional effects of salivary APN on intralipid taste sensing in a mouse model that expresses APN solely in saliva, using a brief-access taste response test. Finally we will use this same salivary adiponectin mouse model to study the effects of salivary APN on food intake and body weight gain when exposed to a high fat diet. The outcome of this project will provide insight into the role of salivary APN on taste perception and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of salivary APN modulation, as an effector of food intake and weight loss. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that salivary adiponectin modulates intralipid taste perception in mice. Aim 1: Characterize Adipor1, Adipor2, and Cdh13 receptor gene expression profiles in Type I, Type II, and  Type III TRCs Aim 2: Determine the effect of salivary APN on intralipid taste response in APN-/- mice Aim 3: Determine the effect of salivary adiponectin on food intake and body weight in APN-/- mice"
"9449830","Depressive symptoms, including negative self-focused emotions (e.g., sadness, guilt), make trauma- exposed Veterans vulnerable to developing depressive pathology and substance use disorders (SUD). Both conditions are in turn linked to persistent executive and functional impairments. A common marker of both depression severity and addictive behavior is anhedonia, i.e., reduced ability to seek and experience pleasure/ healthy rewards, with evidence of reduced neural activity in the reward centers of the brain. Such reward sensitivity alterations are thus likely to play a critical role in promoting depressive and addictive pathology in trauma-exposed Veterans. A precise understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting reward- based decision-making, and how mood is integrated into these processes, is therefore needed to: a) understand the contribution of these risk factors to current and future psychopathology, b) help detect and predict treatment needs/outcomes for Veterans with such complex clinical profiles. Bayesian models can offer a powerful quantitative account of these intricate mechanisms by disentangling: a) learning processes (prediction of reward likelihood in the environment), and b) action selection strategies (choosing an action based on those predictions). This computational framework can help better delineate how low mood impacts both the prediction of rewards, and the integration of these predictions into decision strategies. Moreover, given that existing treatments for trauma-exposed Veterans focus on reducing anxiety symptoms, there is a significant need for developing behavioral treatments that can more thoroughly target depressive symptoms associated with low reward responsiveness, such as anhedonia and substance use. Computationally based assessment of reward processing alterations may be particularly useful and timely for providing new treatment targets and directions for improving such treatment outcomes for trauma-exposed Veterans.  To address these questions, we propose to use computational modeling and neuroimaging to identify precise affective neurocognitive predictors of psychopathology and behavioral treatment response in recently deployed young (age 20-40) trauma-exposed Veterans. This project will use Bayesian modeling applied to the analysis of reward-based decisions, with baseline dependent measures of brain circuit activity derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and experimental manipulation of mood, to delineate precisely a) how sad mood may bias the learning or strategic adjustments guiding reward-based decisions in Veterans, b) the degree to which these affect-driven computational biases relate to depression and problem substance use symptoms in this population, and c) the degree to which these computational markers can predict Veterans' response to a cognitive behavioral treatment targeting depressive symptoms associated with trauma, including guilt and anhedonia. In other words, can computational methods be useful in identifying low reward sensitivity in the depressed brain, and in directing early on Veterans with such markers towards more appropriate and effective treatments? The outcomes of this study will identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of reward responsiveness, affective clinical profile, and treatment response, and provide a cognitive rationale for developing more targeted and effective interventions for Veterans.  This CDA-2 award will facilitate the applicant's training in the utilization of computational and neuroimaging techniques 1) to understand the role of affect-driven cognitive biases in promoting depressive and substance use symptoms, and 2) to predict treatment response and long-term clinical course. Such training will in turn facilitate the applicant's long-term career goals to become a productive and successful VA clinical scientist, whose work focuses on improving early detection and effective treatment of psychopathology in Veterans."
"9537237","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prevention of hospitalization has long been viewed as a major health benefit of the use of influenza vaccine. This was, in large part, the rationale for the initial vaccination programs targeting the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.  However, in the last decade, questions have been raised about the value of such programs. Modern study designs to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) have required laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, as well as documentation of vaccine receipt and the use of a test-negative design to control for differences in healthcare-seeking behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. There is a need for current estimates of VE in preventing influenza-associated hospitalization using these methods. We propose estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza hospitalization in two health systems in Michigan, where we have been conducting annual assessments of VE in various populations since 2008. We will conduct surveillance at two hospitals, and will enroll adult in-patients with acute respiratory infection. Vaccination status will be reported and documented, and considered with laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to estimate vaccine effectiveness for prevention of hospitalization. Analyses will use a test- negative design; those testing positive for influenza ar cases, those testing negative are controls. Modifiers and confounders of vaccine effectiveness such as age, health status, high-risk health conditions, functional status, frailty, education, tim from illness onset to specimen collection, calendar time, and propensity for vaccination will be assessed. In addition to our proposed influenza surveillance and VE assessment, we propose an estimation of the incidence of hospitalization in adults due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV and other respiratory viruses. This will allow for the evaluation of bias in influenza VE assessment due to interaction between influenza vaccination, infection, and non-influenza respiratory viruses, and will establish a platform for the future evaluation of RSV vaccines. We will accomplish these additional objectives by expanding our surveillance to months before and after the typical influenza season and evaluating specimens by molecular methods for RSV and other respiratory viruses."
"9417791","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Age is the major risk factor for many diseases including cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease. Biogerontology research is well positioned to help prevent or at least postpone these diseases by identifying strategies to delay aging and altering its effects on macromolecular, cellular and extracellular damage so that the degree and type of damage does not reach the threshold leading to disease incidence or progression. My laboratory has described the beneficial effect of prolonged fasting and fasting-mimicking diets in promoting cellular resilience and regeneration and organismal healthspan. The data from the previously funded PO1 resulted in a recently completed 100 patient randomized clinical trial indicating that a periodic fasting mimicking diet is effective in reducing risk factors/biomarkers for aging and age-related diseases. Here, we propose to improve these regimens, test their effect on mouse healthspan, and test the hypothesis that they promote both cellular protection and stem cell-based regeneration in multiple systems. We will study the effects of periodic use of a newly designed fasting mimicking diet (FMD5) based on that tested in human clinical trials and of normocaloric protein restriction cycles (PRC) on the aging of the immune and nervous systems. An important goal of Project 1 will be to determine whether these periodic dietary interventions can extend healthspan without exerting adverse effects at very old ages. A major effort will be devoted to the identification of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of periodic fasting mimicking dietary interventions on the regeneration of hematopoietic and neural stem cells and whether this regeneration results in a functional rejuvenation of the immune and nervous systems. We anticipate strong synergism between our project and Project 2, which will investigate the effects and mechanisms of action of the dietary restriction- mimicking mitochondrial peptide humanin, and Project 3, which will test the hypothesis that the gas H2S is a central mediator of fasting-depended protection. We predict that the new insights gained from this project will continue to be translated into clinical trials to identify interventions that are safe and effective in improving human healthspan."

"9308116","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia and stroke are substantially higher among blacks aged 45+, and among residents of the southeastern region of the US. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study is national, longitudinal cohort study of ~ 30,000 blacks and whites designed to advance the understanding of the epidemiology of cognitive decline and stroke, and the contributors to racial and geographic disparities in these outcomes. The current application has three aims:  1. Identify social, cardiovascular, and environmental mechanisms of racial and geographic  disparities in incident vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).  With assessment in mid-life and over a decade of longitudinal cognitive data, REGARDS is  uniquely positioned to identify vascular, social, and behavioral mechanisms underlying  disparities in VCID, and modifiable pathways on which interventions may narrow disparities  in VCID. After completion of a nested calibration/confirmation study to develop an algorithm  for the classification of MCI and dementia, we will characterize racial and geographic  disparities in VCID and determine if interventions on mediators would diminish or eliminate disparities.  2. Answer as-yet-unanswered questions in stroke and cerebrovascular disease epidemiology.  By continuing the successful approaches for stroke surveillance among 17000 active cohort  members, the study will assess the association of risk factor changes and novel biomarkers  quantified with the completion of the second in-person exam with stroke risk and disparities  in stroke risk. In addition, with the aging of the cohort, this aim will provide greatly needed  information on stroke epidemiology in the elderly.  3. Utilize incident risk factor data and biospecimens to identify pathways for development of  incident hypertension and diabetes, with the goal of understanding the impact on incident  VCID and stroke. We have documented that ?30% of the racial disparity in stroke risk is  attributable to racial disparities in prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, and the study  will investigate the biomarker pathways contributing to the higher incidence of hypertension  and diabetes in blacks.  Each proposed aim addresses a topic of profound public health impact, and REGARDS  progress to date uniquely positions the study to address these aims using proven approaches  in an efficient manner."
"9545599","The glutamatergic synapses are the main excitatory synapses in the brain. Abnormal synapse formation and plasticity are responsible for numerous diseases, such as intellectual disability, autism, neuropsychiatric and degenerative disorders. The signaling mechanisms controlling their assembly and plasticity have not been fully understood. Our preliminary studies lead to the surprising finding that components of the highly conserved cell polarity signaling pathways are important regulators. We found that components of both planar cell polarity (PCP) and apical-basal polarity (A-BP) pathways are localized in developing excitatory synapses and interact with multiple key presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins. In this proposal, we propose to test several hypotheses on how these key cell polarity components regulate glutamatergic synapse formation and plasticity."
"9527255","ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are among the new mosquito-transmitted infections that have recently emerged in the Americas (including the continental USA) as major health problems. These diseases are co-endemic, share similar initial symptoms, but differ greatly in disease management and in later stage complications ? birth defects for ZIKV and reactive arthritis (long-term arthralgia) for CHIKV. Reliable diagnostic tools for ZIKV, CHIKV, and other mosquito-borne pathogens are vital for appropriate risk management and therapy; to prevent early misdiagnosis that may worsen later consequences; and for tracking virus transmission patterns. Multiplexed diagnostic tools are urgently needed, but not currently available for use at the point of care. Our long-term objective is to develop an inexpensive, rapid, point of care, multiplexed molecular diagnostic platform for the co-detection of a dozen of mosquito-borne pathogens and the detection of co-infections. In this R21, we take the first steps towards such a system by focusing on molecular detection of ZIKV and CHIKV in blood. Our system will accept a raw sample, carry out sample preparation and a new two-stage isothermal-isothermal enzymatic amplification, and report results. Our device can be used in the clinic, doctor office, and at home with minimal instrumentation and (optionally) without electrical power. To enable quantification and surveillance, the system can optionally interface with a smartphone for signal detection, processing, and transmission. The proposed platform is versatile, can be readily modified to address emerging threats, expanded to detect additional targets, and adapted to operate with various clinical specimens."
"9415735","The overall goal of the Administrative Core of the Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) Appalachian Center for Cellular transport in Obesity Related Disorders (ACCORD) at the Marshall University School of Medicine (MUSOM) is to provide administrative oversight for the career development of ACCORD investigators as well as growth and sustainability of Center infrastructure. We envision the creation of a national center of excellence to promote cellular transport physiology in obesity related disorders at MUSOM, as this institution is at the epicenter of the obesity epidemic of this region. The emphasis of biomedical research will be on cellular and molecular transport abnormalities in obesity associated conditions such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, certain tumors and developmental disabilities. A comprehensive plan for administrative, fiscal, and scientific support will be established and implemented to assure appropriate supervision and direction of ACCORD. A robust plan for individual and group mentoring will be implemented as a foundational component of this COBRE. Mentoring will encompass all aspects of development of junior investigators including, but not limited to, management of lab finances and personnel, meeting individual time- framed research goals, preparation of manuscripts and presentations, development of extramural grants including R01 level funding proposals, and any additional individualized needs as identified. The expected outcome is successful acquisition of R01 NIH funding to sustain and build upon the research foundations that are already established. To further advance the research capacity, ACCORD will closely interact with existing resources (e.g., WV INBRE, UK/MU CTSA), and establish new programs. These will include 1. the Biostatistics and Study Design preCore and Mentoring and Workforce Development preCore that will be grown during phase I to become a full Cores in Phase II of this COBRE; and, 2. Pilot funding to enhance molecular and intracellular regulation of cellular transport in obesity related disorders. Finally, formative and summative evaluation of scientific integrity, progress, and accomplishments of ACCORD will be regularly conducted in a comprehensive manner. Based on results and advice of the Internal Advisory Committee (including its Executive Committee) and External Advisory Committee, appropriate corrective steps, as well as prospective steps to advance the mission of the ACCORD COBRE, will be regularly instituted. With this innovative and much needed Appalachian region program, we will train the next generation of investigators to conduct cellular transport research in obesity which contributes to much of the health care disparities not only in WV, but also in many other regions of this country."
"9580619","Abstract  In New York, the achievement of 90-90-90 goals is jeopardized not by limited access to affordable care and treatment, but by persistent disparities in HIV viral suppression (VS). Complex behavioral and structural barriers to achieving and maintaining VS require coordinated, combination approaches to meet medical and social service needs. In 2009, at 28 Ryan White Part A (RWPA)-funded agencies, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) launched a multi-component HIV Care Coordination Program (CCP) directed toward the most vulnerable, high-need persons living with HIV (PLWH) in NYC. A systematic CCP effectiveness study began in 2013 (R01 MH101028; PIs: Irvine, Nash). Findings to date suggest that the CCP is superior to usual care for high-need subgroups of PLWH, but there remains substantial room for improvement in short- and long-term VS. In an immediate evidence-to- practice feedback loop, the DOHMH is implementing a refined CCP model in 2018. Greater focusing, tailoring and cues for delivery of key components are expected to increase CCP engagement, reach, fidelity, scalability, effectiveness and impact. The aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Estimate the effectiveness of the revised (vs. original) CCP on timely VS (?4 months), using experimental methods (Aim 1); 2) Estimate the effectiveness of the revised CCP (vs. `usual care') on longer-term VS, including VS at 12 months and durable viral suppression (DVS) at 24-36 months, using rigorous observational comparison group methods (Aim 2); and 3) Identify attributes and drivers of provider and client engagement in the intervention and provider and client preferences for future revised-CCP delivery and receipt (Aim 3). Prior studies have not demonstrated any intervention to be effective at improving short- and long-term VS among the many PLWH with major barriers to HIV care continuum engagement. The proposed study, to be conducted on a large scale in real-world HIV service settings, will document the rollout and effects of evidence-informed implementation course corrections to an intervention model focused on these most vulnerable PLWH. In this way, the work will advance a second generation of interventions capable of strengthening the care continuum among PLWH who have been unable to achieve desired ART outcomes in existing interventions, due to major structural or psychosocial barriers."
"9452649","Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic mental illness with high rates of relapse. BD is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder, especially in veterans. More than 130,000 veterans in the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system have been seeking treatment for BD. Individuals suffering with BD are likely to have diminished quality of life due to characteristics of symptoms which manifest as a result of the disorder. Suicide is a major concern within the VA healthcare system, and veterans suffering with BD are at high risk for committing suicide.  Despite the prevalence of BD and widespread research efforts, its pathophysiology remains complicated and obscure. Although various therapeutic modalities have been developed, about one third of BD patients have demonstrated an inadequate response to treatment. There exists a critical need to bridge the gap between neurobiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations of BD. Past research has shown magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in patients with BD to be an effective approach to learn more about the nature of BD.  Oxidative stress induced by neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as a potent cause of BD based on ample prior research. Moreover, it has been reported that oxidative stress could be aggravated by hypobaric hypoxia at altitude. This may result in an increased suicide rate in BD above 2,000 feet altitude according to several recent publications. Additionally, there are animal studies supporting altitude?s effects on BD. Rats exposed to simulated hypobaric hypoxia exhibited brain chemistry similar to that seen in individuals with BD, in addition to demonstrating increased depressive behavior.  In our recent study, we found a difference in the brain chemistry of subjects living in moderate altitude compared to those living at low altitude (sea level); however, we found no difference in bioenergetic metabolites between BD subjects and healthy controls. In this proposed study, we will compare the difference in how veterans with BD compare to healthy controls in how their brains compensate for the shortage of energy enduring hypoxic conditions using MRS techniques. A total number of 88 subjects are planned for recruitment: 44 veterans with BD and 44 healthy controls. All subjects will undergo MRS brain scans to measure brain bioenergetics (phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphates levels) in breathing 16% and 25% oxygen concentrations (equal to oxygen at 10,000 feet and sea level, respectively).  It is hypothesized that coping with decreased energy production as a result of hypoxia may be less efficient in the subjects with BD, relative to healthy controls. The anticipated results of the current proposed study will elucidate the oxidative stress in BD and suggest new therapeutic targets for BD."
"9448379","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Three major contributors to therapeutic resistance that have been difficult to overcome in pancreatic cancer (PDAC) are mutations in the KRAS oncogene, the presence of a dense desmoplastic stroma that acts as a barrier to drug delivery and effector immune cell infiltration, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that renders the tumor ineffective to immunotherapy. Our efforts at targeting downstream effectors of oncogenic RAS, have shown that MEK inhibition (MEKi) results in reciprocal activation of STAT3 signaling, which confers therapeutic resistance and continued PDAC cell growth. Combined inhibition of JAK/STAT3 (STAT3i) and MEKi overcomes therapeutic resistance following RAS inhibition that is mediated through parallel feedback loop activation. We have now identified a novel mechanism showing that combined MEKi and STAT3i also inhibits tumor fibrosis and enhances CD8+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL) infiltration to the tumor while downregulating immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME, resulting in reduced tumor burden and improved survival in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMs) of PDAC. In addition, we show that the tumor suppressive effects of MEKi and STAT3i are T cell dependent. This change in the TME, however, is accompanied by sustained PD-L1/PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression. Our preliminary results further show that combined MEKi and STAT3i with PD-1 inhibition can harness the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors for an enhanced anti-tumor response. Therapeutic strategies that reprogram the tumor stroma to activate T-cell anti-tumor immunity and reverse immune tolerance are of paramount importance as they have the potential to revolutionize treatment for pancreatic cancer and improve clinical outcomes.  Our central hypothesis is that MEKi and STAT3i will reprogram cellular components of the PDAC TME to stimulate infiltration of CD8+ CTLs and overcome the immunosuppressive milieu of PDAC to enhance the effects of checkpoint inhibition (CPI) for a durable and sustained anti-tumor response. This will be proven by the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine if checkpoint inhibition with MEKi and STAT3i will improve survival in GEMs of PDAC. Safety and efficacy of MEKi/STAT3i and anti-PD1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies treatment response will be determined in two different GEMs of PDAC. Aim 2: Determine if changes in the stromal and immune microenvironment induced by MEKi/STAT3i and checkpoint inhibition result in a durable and sustained anti-tumor immune response in PDAC in vivo. In this aim, multiplex flow cytometry will be used to detect the changes in the cell types and activation phenotypes to determine if the differences pre- and post-treatment predict response. Aim 3: Determine the effects of PDAC cell specific and CAFs specific knockdown of MEK and/or STAT3 signaling on changes in the stromal and immune microenvironment in PDAC. This aim will elucidate the mechanism of cell-specific knockdown of MEK and/or STAT3 mediated changes in that result in increased infiltration CD8+ T cells and suppression of suppressive MDSCs and Tregs. This work will not only evaluate a novel treatment strategy for PDAC, but may uncover potential biomarkers of response to checkpoint inhibitors."
"9312112","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to develop and validate novel compressed sensing (CS) approaches to dramatically improve the spatial and temporal resolution of quantitative dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). CS exploits prior information (assumptions) about MR images to infer missing data and produce high-quality images from significantly less data than previously thought possible. CS has already proven extremely successful in MR angiography and cardiac MRI, where it has accelerated some acquisitions by up to 10- to 100-fold, but is relatively unexplored in cancer imaging. DCE-MRI involves the serial acquisition of heavily T1-weighted images before and after the injection of a contrast agent to increase water relaxation rates in tissues. The resultin data can then be analyzed with appropriate pharmacokinetic models to extract quantitative parameters reporting on, for example, vessel perfusion and permeability, and tissue volume fractions. DCE-MRI has been applied to predict the early response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer, but the technique is not yet robust and accurate enough for the clinic. A fundamental practical limitation of DCE-MRI is the necessity to simultaneously acquire high temporal resolution, to adequately sample the contrast time course, and high spatial resolution, which is required for clinical morphological assessment and accurate tumor delineation. In traditional Cartesian MRI acquisitions, one must choose between high spatial or high temporal resolution before the scan. With a golden ratio acquisition, the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution is eliminated. A single DCE-MRI scan may then be used for both accurate kinetic modeling by slicing the data at high temporal cadence, while also allowing a high spatial resolution image to be formed by taking the data as a whole. Thus, a golden ratio acquisition coupled with CS has great potential to enable a clinically relevant DCE-MRI protocol that provides adequate temporal resolution for kinetic modeling without sacrificing the spatial resolution required for morphological evaluation. This project has three aims: (1) to develop a compressed sensing based high temporal resolution protocol for quantitative DCE-MRI, (2) to develop a compressed sensing based high spatial resolution T1-weighted anatomical imaging protocol for morphological evaluation, and (3) to apply the developed CS-based protocols in vivo for validation and evaluation. If this project is successful, it will significantly improve te ability to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, provide new CS methods for the community to apply to other in vivo applications, and validate CS in an important cancer imaging application."
"9417087","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyloid light chain (AL) or primary amyloidosis is the most prevalent systemic amyloidosis worldwide. More than half of patients with AL amyloidosis present with cardiac involvement, resulting in the development of a rapidly progressive AL amyloid cardiomyopathy, with limited response to current therapies and median survival of 13 months. We have identified a potent cardiotoxic response in cardiomyocytes to human amyloidogenic light chain (AL-LC) isolated from patients with AL amyloid cardiomyopathy, as a critical component of the disease's pathogenesis. However, the mechanism underlying AL-LC induced cardiotoxicity have remained unclear. We have recently found that AL-LC cardiotoxicity culminates on the mitochondrial. Using comprehensive metabolomics approaches, we have found that AL-LC results in selective antagonism of mitochondrial ?-oxidation of long chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFA) with compensatory upregulation of an ER pathway of ?-oxidation, with marked increase in byproducts of ?-oxidation present in cellular models of AL-LC cardiotoxicity and patients with AL amyloid cardiomyopathy. In this proposal, we will leverage study of the largest amassed cohort of patients with AL amyloid cardiomyopathy, established cellular and animal models of AL-LC cardiotoxicity, and state of the art mass spectrometry based metabolomics to (1) define the in vivo metabolite signature of AL amyloid cardiomyopathy and to identify a first early diagnostic metabolite biomarker for this disease; (2) determine the functional significance of shifting lipid metabolism from mitochondrial ?-oxidation to ER ?-oxidation and the contribution of this process to the pathogenesis of AL-LC cardiotoxicity; and (3) to determine if bypassing or restoring mitochondrial ?-oxidation using approved agents may serve to protect against the development of AL amyloid cardiomyopathy. Our project is centered in line with the recent NIH's PA announcement (PA-13-286: Systemic Amyloidosis: Basic, Translational and Clinical Research [RO1]) and will provide unprecedented mechanistic, diagnostic and therapeutic insight into this disease process."
"8976973","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability among veterans, and Department of Veterans Affairs health care users are the most severely affected.  There is ample evidence that exercise improves pain, function, and other outcomes among patients with knee OA.  However, the vast majority of individuals with knee OA are physically inactive.  There is clearly a need to develop and implement programs that efficiently and effectively foster regular physical activity and improve key patient-centered outcomes among veterans with knee OA.  The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness a novel STepped Exercise Program for Knee OsteoArthritis (STEP-KOA).  This will be a randomized controlled trial of n=345 veterans with symptomatic knee OA in two VISN 6 sites, with participants assigned to two study arms: STEP-KOA and Arthritis Education Control (AE).  STEP- KOA will begin with three months of access to a low-resource internet-based exercise training program that uses patient-specific information to determine and deliver an appropriate personalized exercise plan (Step 1).  Participants who do not meet response criteria for clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function after three months of Step 1 will additionally receive telephone calls from an  exercise counselor for three months, to facilitate adherence and address barriers to physical activity (Step 2).  Participants who still fail to meet response criteria after Step 2 will receivein-person physical therapy visits, which address specific functional impairments and further tailor exercise recommendations (Step 3).  Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months (primary outcome time point).  Veterans in the AE group will be offered participation in STEP-KOA after completing study assessments.  The primary outcome will be the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a measure of lower extremity pain, stiffness and function.  The secondary outcomes will be objective measures of physical function.  The main study analyses will compare the STEP-KOA intervention to the AE control condition at follow-up time points.  We will also evaluate patient characteristics associated with the need for progression to each Step and will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of STEP-KOA.  This stepped exercise intervention is matched with patient needs, and it also provides the VA with a potential approach for focusing limited physical therapy resources toward patients who do not respond adequately to initial, less resource intensive and costly strategies to improve physical activity and related outcomes."
"9617164","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using oral embriticitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) decreases HIV acquisition among men who have sex with men and adult heterosexual men and women. Based in part on evidence generated by the iPrEx trial, led by this team of investigators, oral FTC/TDF PrEP has received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, and the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control have issued recommendations for its use. The subsequent iPrEx Open Label Extension (OLE) ecis the first PrEP demonstration project to evaluate factors associated with uptake of PrEP, effective use of PrEP, and sexual practices during open label access. All phases of the pioneering iPrEx studies were completed in June 2014. The project proposed here will leverage the uniquely valuable collections of specimens and data from the recently completed iPrEx studies to answer key unanswered questions about how antiretroviral drug exposure in HIV exposed persons could attenuate the course of infection, and by what mechanisms. There are now precedents that early exposure to antiretroviral drugs can alter the course of infection (eg: the Visconti cohort) or cause prolonged viral remission (eg: the Mississippi infant). We found that seroconversion in the first 12 weeks of PrEP use, associated with detectable viral RNA detection prior to PrEP use, was less frequent in the active arm compared with placebo arm in two PrEP trials (iPrEx and CAPRISA 004). Trends toward this imbalance are evident in all PrEP trials, suggesting that nascent infection may be attenuated in some people who achieve high concentrations of antiretroviral drugs, as might occur in the rectal mucosa after oral FTC/TDF dosing or in the vaginal mucosa after use of a tenofovir vaginal gel. In aim 1, we will seek evidence of aborted HIV infection among more than 1000 iPrEx participants who started oral FTC/TDF and never seroconverted, even during gaps in PrEP use. The impact of PrEP medications, and viral exposure during PrEP use, on the host will be explored using an analysis of global host gene expression that optimally utilizes the uniquely valuable specimens from these trials. We will learn how exposure to PrEP drugs could diminish immune activation in a manner that contributes to PrEP's protective benefit. We will also learn whether diminished immune activation and expression of intrinsic anti-viral factors in the absence of PrEP are associated with subsequent susceptibility to HIV infection. These hypotheses will be evaluated in aim 2 using state-of-the-art global assessment of the human transcriptome at baseline prior to PrEP use, after HIV infection, and after antiretroviral exposure Taken together, this project will leverage the uniquely valuable iPrEx specimen bank and database to test specific hypotheses that bear directly on PrEP activity, HIV cure, persistent infection, host factors governing susceptibility to infection."
"9417686","Title: Ultra Low Energy Computing for Next Generation  Implantable Smart Cardiac Pacemakers Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases are one of the major causes of all human deaths. Arrhythmia related human cardiac mortality and morbidity can be reduced by the implantable artificial pacemakers that are designed to monitor the cardiac status and to regulate the beating of the heart. Not many years ago, the functionality of a pacemaker was mostly limited to monitoring signals from the heart and assisting its operation via artificial pacing when any predefined abnormality was detected. Recently, pacemaker manufacturers have started incorporating advanced features to make the pacemaker smarter and more user friendly. With low energy wireless connectivity, the pacemakers can be programmed to automatically activate alerts to the cardiologist or to the hospital via the connected smart phone or network when an emergency occurs. In the future, the wireless connectivity may also enable the cardiologist to remotely adjust the settings of the pacemaker to address the emergency or to recommend other corrective measures. Unfortunately all the added new features come at the expense of increased power consumption. Also, the wireless connectivity of the implantable devices opens up the possibility of hacking. In the case of pacemakers a hacker will be able to maliciously reprogram the pacemaker. These device security threats lead to the need for secure communication channels. The entire computational task inside a pacemaker is done by a dedicated processor. The upcoming generation of pacemakers is expected to both diversify the processor work-load and demand significantly increased computational capabilities. This research aims to develop low-energy computation methods and design methodologies that can enable future cardiac pacemakers to become a reality. A novel concept of dynamic computing is developed as a part of this research which will enable the reduction of pacemaker power consumption by detecting and eliminating repetitions of low level arithmetic/logical operations both in software and hardware implementations. By identifying overlapping computational steps and predictable data flow patterns present in most implantable cardiac pacemaker workloads, the proposed design methodologies promise enhanced performance and improvement in battery life. Applicability of the developed techniques will be investigated and tested in the context of pacemaker signal processing, security, and reliability workloads. Nearly 225,000 permanent pacemakers are implanted annually in the United States. The battery in a pacemaker can last 8-10 years and the pacemaker itself is replaced during a surgical procedure. The development of ultra-low energy computing techniques for pacemakers is expected to extend the battery life further, which in turn will reduce the frequency of the surgical procedures needed to replace the pacemaker. The reduced number of surgical procedures will also bring down the associated health care coast. The low energy computing techniques could also enable the future pacemakers to add more advanced features without sacrificing the battery life. ."

"9449458","PROJECT SUMMARY Dendrites exhibit immense diversity in their macrostructure (arbors), which stipulates the availability of a neuron to circuits and its computational properties, and microstructure (dendritic spines), which dynamically support and shape synaptic function. Arbor and spine/synapse development must be coordinated to form functional dendrites. Though synaptic activity plays a crucial role, the heterogeneity of developmental responses to activity indicates that other mechanisms are required. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor (A-GPCR) brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1/ ADGRB1) coordinates dendritic arbor and spine development through differential activation of multiple signaling pathways. This hypothesis is based on our published and preliminary data showing: (i) that BAI1 mediates growth arrest of dendritic arbors via a novel pathway coupling to the Rho-family small GTPase RhoA; (ii) that BAI1 promotes excitatory synaptogenesis in cortical and hippocampal neurons via the Rho-family small GTPase Rac1 and trans-synaptic signaling; and (iii) that BAI1 differentially affects dendrite development in an age-dependent manner and that altering BAI1 configuration has age-dependent effects on downstream signaling pathways. We propose a multidisciplinary approach to define the roles of BAI A-GPCRs in regulating and coordinating dendritic arbor and spine/synapse development utilizing in vivo and cultured neurons, genetic models, molecular replacement, live imaging with fluorescent reporters, mixed culture assays, biochemistry and electrophysiology. The pathways that we are defining include proteins implicated in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder (Bcr), autism spectrum disorder (neuroligin-1 and IRSp53), and schizophrenia (BAI3). Thus, success of this proposal will not only provide material advances in the study of dendrite development and synaptogenesis, but also test a novel and powerful hypothesis regarding the coordination of these processes and provide new therapeutic targets against widespread human mental diseases."
"9453453","Abstract Abnormal oncogenic activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is a key trigger in inducing various types of cancers including lung cancer, which is recognized as one of the most important active targets for NSCLC treatment. The application of EGFR-targeted inhibitors has provided significant benefit for lung cancer patient treatment. However, the acquisition of resistance to EGFR-targeted inhibitors in cancer cells is the major challenge for clinicians and oncologists. In addition to known genetic alterations such as EGFR secondary mutations causing EGFR-TKI resistance, compensatory activation of signaling pathways without interruption of genome integrity remains to be defined. Our preliminary data showed a persistent S6K1 activation in resistant non-small lung cancer cells upon EGFR-TKIs treatment, but not in sensitive cells. Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1, RPS6KB1), a member of AGC family of serine/threonine protein kinases and a key effector of the mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1), is known to regulates protein synthesis, cell cycle, cell growth and survival in response to growth factors, and cytokines under both physiological condition and pathological condition. Deregulation of S6K1 is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in lung, colorectal, ovarian, and breast cancer. However the link of S6K1 with drug resistance remains to be elucidated. We hypothesize that S6K1 activation contributes to the acquired resistance to EGFR target therapy in NSCLCs. We plan to test this hypothesis through three aims. Aim 1 is to investigate if S6K1 activation is a new mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR target therapy in NSCLC. Aim 2 is to investigate molecular mechanism of EGFR-TKI- resistance through S6K1 pathway. Aim 3 is to investigate the effect of S6K1 inhibitor PF4708671 for overcoming EGRF-TKI resistance. The proposal will help to understand new mechanism in response to EGFR-TKI and to identify S6K1 and its signaling as potential new druggable target(s). The successful completion of proposed study will provide a potential therapeutic strategy by overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance for lung cancer treatment in the future. "
"9458067","Advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) have accelerated the discovery of the genetic basis of numerous human diseases and conditions, including congenital disorders. These conditions affect a wide range of physiological systems, including cardiovascular, craniofacial, nervous, genital/urinary, in addition to general defects growth and dysmorphology. However, the process of ascribing causality to a given variant can be challenging and remains a major bottleneck in our understanding of human disease. Animal model validation is a powerful tool to evaluate the causality of a given variant, and the mouse provides the ideal mammalian system to model developmental disorders. CRISPR/Cas9 technology has simplified and reduced the timelines for mouse model creation, but breeding time will still typically take up to a year or more before phenotypes can be examined. Thus, a validation platform that directly examines this founder population (F0 generation) promises to massively reduce the time and expense required for validation of new human disease mutations in the mouse. Our preliminary work provides proof-of-principle evidence that this approach is feasible, however challenges remain before such an approach can be applied to a wide range of human developmental conditions. Direct screening of F0 embryos provides a means to examine more difficult engineering and breeding challenges, include dominant mutations that are predicted to be lethal in the mouse, and modeling multigenic causes of disease. Moreover, a F0 platform can provide a tool for rapid, direct genetic interrogation of pathways through multiplex mutagenesis. Challenges remain, however, before this approach can be effectively implemented as a robust platform. For example, while generation indels and deletions through error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair is highly efficient, editing of specific mutations through homology directed repair (HDR) occurs at a much lower rate. Additionally, founders and F0 embryos are typically mosaic and the tools to quantitatively assess both the spectrum of alleles and the mutagenesis rate for each require further development. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to build upon our proof-of-principle studies to optimize our F0 screening platform and implement it to model structural birth defects. We will test our hypotheses that 1) modification of parameters of the CRISPR mutagenesis protocol can improve the efficiency and reduce the mosaicism of HDR; and 2) that we can apply the platform to specific unique congenital disease challenges not easily modeled with standard mouse genetics approaches. This will take advantage of several key resources, including a high-throughput embryonic phenotyping pipeline developed for the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) and the large-scale mouse production capabilities of The Jackson Laboratory. The long-term goal is to integrate our screening platform with large- scale precision modeling initiatives, providing a rapid and robust means to evaluate new genetic variants in a mammalian model system. "
"9445279","Project Summary More than 50% of adults treated for diabetes, hypertension, or lipid disorders have suboptimal medication adherence, a prominent barrier to continued improvement in chronic disease care in the United States. Primary care providers (PCPs) often fail to identify medication nonadherence and/or have insufficient time and training to address underlying reasons for it. In this project, we propose a patient-centered and technology-driven strategy to identify patients with adherence issues and apply a team approach to help them achieve evidence- based personalized goals for glucose, blood pressure, or lipids. This intervention extends the use of a widely available clinical decision support (CDS) infrastructure to support a model of care that, for the first time outside of a fully integrated care environment, will integrate retail pharmacists within the primary care team. The intervention relies on a continuous health informatics loop to do the following: (a) identify high-risk patients with adherence problems at the point of care by expanding the capability of an electronic medical record (EMR)-linked CDS to capture pharmacy claims data and measure adherence; (b) establish and maintain an auto-populating up-to-date registry of patients identified for proactive pharmacist outreach at retail pharmacy locations; (c) implement a pharmacist outreach strategy based on an information-motivation-behavioral framework recommended by the World Health Organization with demonstrated ability to influence adherence across a variety of clinical applications; and (d) coordinate care and adherence information by incorporating pharmacist assessment and action plans into CDS at subsequent office encounters. The intervention was conceptualized and designed with extensive input from PCPs and in collaboration with pharmacy leaders to ensure efficient integration with existing clinic staff and workflows. We will test the effectiveness of this intervention using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 20 primary care clinics with approximately 50,000 adults with suboptimally controlled diabetes, hypertension, or lipid disorders. We will evaluate intervention impact on objective measures of adherence (proportion of days covered) and changes in hypertension control, glycemic control, and statin use. We will assess health care costs and long-term cost-effectiveness using microsimulation modeling, and in secondary analysis, assess intervention impact on primary nonadherence, 10-year cardiovascular risk, the care experience from the provider, patient, and key stakeholder perspectives, and on patient-reported medication adherence measures. This project builds upon previous National Institutes of Health funded research conducted by our team and (a) extends the capabilities of EMRs already used in the care of tens of millions of Americans, (b) electronically integrates pharmacists within the primary care team, (c) has the potential to significantly improve chronic disease care and translate massive investments in health information systems into tangible health benefits for large numbers of patients."

"9626559","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-risk neuroblastoma (NB) remains a major challenge in pediatric oncology accounting for 15% of all pediatric cancer mortality with an overall 5-year survival of less than 50% for this aggressive embryonal malignancy. As with 90% of all solid tumors, the primary cause of death for NB is relapsed drug-resistant disease. Significant improvements in cure rates for NB will require novel biologically specific approaches since chemotherapy at maximal tolerated doses still fails in over half of theses cases. Models of cancer stem cells (CSCs) now suggest that treatment failure and relapse is often driven by a small drug-resistant subpopulation of self-renewing tumor initiating cells. Our therapeutic goal is to combine anti-CSC therapies with current chemotherapy approaches to both improve initial drug responses and prevent recurrent metastatic disease. Preliminary Data: We have recently demonstrated the isolation and characterization of a highly tumorigenic subpopulation based on the expression of CD114 (the surface receptor for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)), which fulfills the major phenotypic requirements for tumor initiating CSCs. This tumor subpopulation is highly enriched (up to 10-fold) after chemotherapy in NB tumors resected after 3 cycles of chemotherapy and has gene expression, microRNA expression, and epigenetic profiles which recapitulate those of iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells) and ESCs (embryonic stem cells). STAT3 activation through phosphorylation (pSTAT3) is the canonical downstream effector of G-CSF ligand binding to its receptor (CD114). pSTAT3 has a central role in regulating the maintenance of normal and malignant stem cell populations in part through transcriptional regulation of microRNAs involved in reprogramming and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT). We demonstrate within the CD114+ CSC-like cells, G-CSF dependent pSTAT3 activation results in increased expression of STAT3 target microRNAs. We also demonstrate that the CSFR3 gene (encoding CD114) is a direct transcriptional target of pSTAT3, suggesting a feedback loop for maintenance of expression of this receptor. We therefore hypothesize the following: a) the G-CSF/STAT3 signaling axis promotes the maintenance, drug resistance and metastatic potential of CD114+ NB cells b) Targeting CD114+ cells, either directly or via G- CSF/STAT3 pathway inhibition will limit tumor proliferation and the development of metastasis. C) Concomitant targeting of both the CD114+ and CD114- subpopulations in neuroblastoma should significantly augment chemotherapies by preventing regeneration of CD114- cells from the CD114+ precursors. In Specific Aims 1 and 2, we will block the G-CSF/STAT3 axis in CD114+ NB cells using by several independent approaches (anti-receptor antibody, JAK/STAT small molecule inhibitors) to determine the role of G-CSF signaling in CD114+ driven NB tumorigenesis and metastasis. In Aim 3 we will determine how STAT3 target microRNAs contribute to the stemness phenotype of CD114+ cells."
"9473425","Summary: Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide and is linked to a variety of co- morbidities including Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), and Obesity. Work over the last 20 years by our group and others have identified the Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor (AT2R) as a key player in the development and pathogenesis of cardiac and vascular structural damage. Clinically, in men, loss of Agtr2 expression is associated with increased arterial stiffness, impaired kidney function, and increased pulse pressure. Literature shows that female-specific increase in AT2R expression protects murine female models from vascular injury. Healthy female (ZL-F) rats have higher cardiac expression of the X-linked Agtr2 compared to male (ZL-M) rats; but T2DM suppressed cardiac Agtr2 expression only in ZDF-F (female), not in ZDF-M (male). We posit that increasing Agtr2 expression in ZDF-F rat heart will render protection from cardiomyocyte loss and scarring and this treatment will be of particular benefit to women suffering from CVD. However, there are no AT2R agonists that can increase Agtr2 expression. We observed that NP-6A4, a novel peptide agonist of AT2R, could increase Agtr2 expression in rat and human CV cells and mitigate cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and capillary rarefaction in male Zucker obese rats. Our conceptually novel central hypothesis is based on these observations and states that NP-6A4-AT2R-signaling offers a new therapeutic approach to mitigate sex differences in CVD by increasing Agtr2 gene expression. We discovered two new cross-talks induced by NP- 6A4-AT2R; first is activation of ALK2-ALK1 pathway that mitigates capillary rarefaction, and the second is suppression of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) involved in pathological CV remodeling. In Aim 1, we will validate our hypothesis that NP-6A4 improves structural and functional cardiac and vascular parameters in rat models with chronic CVD induced by T2DM via increasing Agtr2 expression and signaling. We will use our new methods of detecting subclinical damage and subsequent protective remodeling via speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in combination with histopathology, and extensive molecular signaling approaches. In Aim 2, we will investigate if NP-6A4 mitigates cardiac and vascular structural damage caused by acute mechanical- and drug-induced injury. We will also investigate a) the role of cross-talk between NP-6A4-AT2R and the Activin-like kinases (ALK2-ALK1 pathway) in improving capillary density, and b) the significance of the cross-talk between NP-6A4-AT2R and MR in mitigating pathological cardiovascular remodeling. Collectively, positive results of this study will have high clinical relevance since they validate a) the efficacy of NP-6A4 as a novel therapeutic for acute and chronic CVD, and for mitigating sex differences in CVD, and b) the efficacy of STE-based diagnosis of the progression and mitigation of T2DM-induced subclinical cardiovascular damage."
"9541895","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Focused Ultrasound (FUS), in conjunction with microbubbles, remains the sole technique that can induce localized BBB opening noninvasively and regionally. Intranasal (IN) administration has emerged as a promising approach for drug delivery to the brain. Traditionally, it has been successfully used as a convenient method for drug delivery to the systemic circulation, because IN administered drugs can be absorbed through a rich vascular network in the nasal cavity into the systemic circulation. Although most drugs absorbed into the blood circulation cannot enter the brain parenchyma because of the BBB, it has been demonstrated feasible in animal and clinical studies that drugs can be directly delivered from the nose to the brain, bypassing the BBB. Over the past few years, our team has shown that the BBB can be reproducibly opened using FUS and intravenously (IV)-administered microbubbles in a specific subcortical region associated with neurodegenerative disease. Molecules on the order of 0.5 kDa-4 MDa, including Dextran, neurotrophic factors and viral vectors, have been shown to be successfully delivered and localized within the intracellular space of neurons triggering signaling pathways within the neuronal cell. In this study, we hypothesize that the BBB opening can be applied entirely noninvasively (i.e., injection-free) while reducing the risk of systemic toxicity. FUS and intranasal delivery are therefore combined for the first time for enhancing the delivery efficiency of intranasally administered drugs to a targeted region while nanodroplets (ND) substitute microbubbles due to their smaller size that should facilitate intranasal delivery (FUS+IN+ND). We propose to develop an entirely noninvasive approach for trans-BBB deliver that offers the advantages of 1) an injection- free approach due to the intranasal (inhalation) administration , 2) higher selectivity due to the nanodroplet vehicle used and 3) lower toxicity due to both intranasal and nanodroplet approaches. The specific aims are thus to: 1) demonstrate feasibility of BBB opening using nanodroplets administered intranasally; 2) demonstrate efficacy of facilitating protein and gene therapy in a Parkinsonian mouse model. Intranasal delivery of both the vehicle (nanodroplet) and the drug (protein or virus) in combination with FUS could provide an entirely noninvasive, more targeted and less toxic alternative to the currently used methodologies facilitating thus clinical translation and acceptance."
"9519340","ABSTRACT Involuntary muscle activity (spasms) is the most debilitating aspect of spasticity after spinal cord injury (SCI) because the contractions interfere with everyday tasks, and limit rehabilitation. Treatments are not always effective, lowering health- related quality of life. Our long-term Objective is to use closed-loop control of tendon vibration to implement clinically meaningful management of muscle spasms, and to understand the spinal circuits responsible for spasm generation. Specifically, we aim to build on our existing capabilities and collaborations to: 1a) Refine the design of the housing in our wearable device to deliver vibration to the Achilles tendon by using consumer-oriented input; 1b) Determine the vibration parameters that reduce spasms in leg muscles paralyzed by SCI in the laboratory using the wearable device. In either a seated or reclined position, spasms will be detected using electromyography (EMG), then the Achilles tendon will be vibrated at different frequencies, durations and amplitudes to dampen the spasms in real-time using closed-loop control; 2) Examine the efficacy of tendon vibration in altering muscle spasms by treating spasms as they occur, which personalizes the intervention for maximal clinical and user impact. The acute (chronic) effects of vibration on spasms will be evaluated during 24-hour EMG recordings by comparing unconditioned to conditioned spasms at baseline, during the vibration intervention, and post intervention. Pre/Post measures of different aspects of spasticity will provide insight into the site(s), magnitude, and time-course of changes that occur with vibration; and user perspective on the effects of the therapy. Combining the power of non-invasive physiological recordings with functional, clinical and participant reported outcomes will also reveal neural and muscular plasticity, the mechanisms underlying the action of vibration on spasms, and importantly, the rationale to improve this novel approach to spasm management after SCI and other neurological disorders. Many individuals with SCI may find non-pharmacological treatment for spasms attractive because it may lead to reductions or elimination of spasm medications."
"9414687","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Initiative for Maximizing Student Development at Vanderbilt University exists to increase the number of Ph.D.'s awarded to graduate students in biomedical research who are underrepresented, as broadly defined by the NIH. Our nation faces many challenges in biomedical research to find better treatments and hopefully cures for a range of debilitating and/or fatal diseases such as cancer, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. The innovation and problem solving needed to make progress in these areas requires a diverse group of talented scientists, because diversity generates greater numbers of new perspectives and more inventive solutions. For these reasons and given the demographic shifts in the population, the Vanderbilt IMSD has a key mission to ensure that the most talented of this country's increasingly diverse youth are trained for careers in biomedical research, especially those whose talent would be otherwise unrecognized or unrealized. We want to ensure our diverse Ph.D. trainees are well prepared to enter a range of career paths, but particularly the professoriate where, as scientific leaders, they will be responsible for drivig novel problem-solving approaches and training the next generation to follow. By implementing a holistic admissions approach, we have fully achieved the goal of enrolling a diverse group of graduate trainees, now ranging from 20-28% URM in our first-year graduate programs. Moreover, the Vanderbilt IMSD program, which began in 2007, has so far produced 13 Ph.D. graduates who have gone on to either academic postdoctoral positions at research-intensive universities, biopharma, or in one case a tenure-track faculty position at a minority serving institution. Nearly two dozen more advanced IMSD graduate students will be completing their Ph.D. training in the next 2-3 years ahead. We propose to maintain all of the support and development programs and comprehensive mentoring, especially peer mentoring, that have been vital to our IMSD program's success. Taking our cue from the adage begin with the end in mind, we are planning a new initiative Joining the Professoriate that will focus on the development of leadership skills through both explicit training (in collaboration with the Vanderbilt Owen Graduate School of Business) and frequent exposures to highly successful visiting URM faculty role models. Although URMs now comprise one-third of the US college-age population, they earn only 15-17% of the B.S./B.A. degrees in STEM fields. Thus, in order to sustain our progress, we need to address the undergraduate pipeline. In collaboration with the Vanderbilt Center for Science Outreach, we have designed an innovative pre-college summer science outreach program to offer URM pre-college students an opportunity to begin developing a science identity while still in high school. Simultaneously, the IMSD graduate students who design, direct, and implement the program will gain valuable leadership and teaching skills. We plan regular summative and formative assessments of all our programs to ensure they are adding value and aligned with our mission."
"9607382","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the proposed work is to determine how the Sall1 transcription factor and its associated chromatin remodeling complexes control gene regulation to generate a normal endowment of nephrons. This will illuminate mechanisms that underlie human genetic syndromes and common sporadic birth defects, such as renal hypoplasia (small kidneys with reduced numbers of nephrons), which result in kidney failure.  Formation of the proper complement of nephrons requires a balance between expansion of multi-potent renal progenitor cells and differentiation. Genetic deficiency of Sall1 alters gene expression in the developing kidney, accelerating nephron differentiation leading to a depletion of nephron progenitor cells and renal hypoplasia. These uncommitted nephron precursors, termed cap mesenchyme, must respond to canonical Wnt/ß-catenin signals by either undergoing self-renewal or mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition to form most tubular segments of the nephron. The transcriptional mechanisms that control these opposing responses of the cap mesenchyme are not known, but current evidence argues that Sall1 is pivotal in this critical developmental decision.  Our recent studies provide evidence for a novel paradigm. We propose that Sall1 cooperates with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) chromatin remodeling complex, to determine nephron progenitor cell fate by regulating the transcriptional output in response to Wnt/ß-catenin.  This application will test key predictions of this model using a combination of genetic, genomic, and biochemical approaches. Six2 is an inhibitor of nephron differentiation. In Aim 1, we will determine if Sall1 directly up-regulates Six2 expression in cap mesenchyme to restrain differentiation of progenitor cells. Expression of Wnt9b, the main differentiation signal, is increased in Sall1 mutants. We will determine if the combination of increased Wnt9b and reduced Six2 expression are sufficient to cause accelerated nephron formation, and exhaustion of self-renewing progenitor cells. Aim 2 will determine how Sall1 and NuRD control the transcriptional output in nephron progenitor cells to determine whether the uncommitted precursor cells undergo self-renewal or initiate nephron differentiation. The mechanistic insights gained from these studies will advance efforts to propagate nephron progenitors in vitro and/or promote regeneration of mature tubular epithelial cells in order to correct nephron deficits."
"9619780","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors comprise two different classes, nucleos(t)ide RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside RTIs (NNRTIs), which act by entirely different mechanisms. However, their extensive use has led to the emergence of drug resistance mutations that may affect use of new RTIs. As new drugs like rilpivirine (RPV) become increasingly available to patients infected with HIV strains of subtypes other than B (HIV-nonB), it is important to understand how RPV resistance-associated mutations determined in HIV-1B samples (RAMB) affect susceptibility patterns in both drug-naïve or -treated HIV-nonB patients. This proposal aims to understand differences in drug resistance among different HIV subtypes (HIV-1B vs. HIV-nonB). Recent collaborative clinical data (with A. Sönnerborg and U. Neogi) identified RAMBs in treatment-naïve (6- 11%, depending on subtype) and nevirapine (NVP) or efavirenz (EFV)-based therapy-failed patients (22-34%, depending on subtype). Hence, it is hypothesized that patients who failed NVP/EFV-based therapy are more likely to fail RPV-based therapy. Moreover, patients treated with TDF/FTC/RPV failed therapy through RPV- associated mutations in ~9% of HIV-1B patients compared to ~25% of HIV-nonB patients. Preliminary analysis of RT sequences from clinical cohorts of HIV-1B and HIV-nonB patients that are treatment-naïve or -failed (NVP/EFV-based) showed an increase in prevalence of predicted RAMBs. Hence, it is also hypothesized that RPV resistance emerges through different mechanisms in various subtypes. Furthermore, until recently, it was thought resistance to one class of RTIs was unrelated to the other. However, RT connection subdomain mutations (CSMs), namely N348I in HIV-1B, have been identified, which give multi-class drug resistance (MCDR) to both NRTIs and NNRTIs. It is hypothesized that CSMs affect MCDR differently in various HIV subtypes. The following aims will be addressed: SA 1. Determine how the presence of CSMs and RAMBs affect RPV susceptibility of HIV-1B and -nonB SA 2. Virologically characterize the contribution of CSMs and RAMBs on fitness and multi-class resistance in multiple subtypes SA 3. Unravel biochemical and structural mechanisms of the MCDR phenotype in HIV-1B and HIV-nonB The goal of this application is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying MCDR and how CSMs may impact the RPV susceptibility of different HIV subtypes, providing important insights into the feasibility of RPV as first-line therapy in HIV 1B and HIV-nonB patients."
"9465805","Project Summary/Abstract Single-cell technologies have contributed to the understanding of underlying order in heterogenous samples, providing a platform to identify rare cell types with implications to human disease. These platforms are largely based on analyses of single-cell suspensions and do not provide a spatial context to the findings. It is becoming increasingly evident that the tissue architecture is a critical parameter and contributes significantly to the overall biological state of a sample. High-parameter imaging technologies enable the identification and localization of rare cell types in heterogenous tissue samples. Currently available high-parameter imaging technologies are time-consuming, limited in the number of parameters that can be reproducibly imaged and/or are cost-prohibitive for broad use in the scientific community. Akoya Biosciences Inc. has exclusively licensed a new high-parameter imaging technology termed CODEX (CO-Detection by indEXing) that is robust, inexpensive and can quickly acquire fluorescence data across tens of parameters. The CODEX platform consists of a set of specialized biologic reagents, including tagged antibody and oligo products, as well as a fluidics robot that can be attached to any inverted microscope. The broad applicability of this technology will enable any lab, ranging from small academic labs to large pharmaceutical research entities, to acquire high-parameter imaging data. These analyses will enable a deep understanding of disease mechanisms, therapeutic targets and overall tissue architecture. The goal of Akoya Biosciences Inc. is to commercialize this technology through the production of the fluidics robot as well as reagent kits for antibody staining and signal rendering. The current version of the technology was developed for the analysis of fresh-frozen (FF) tissue samples; however, most tissue samples are stored as formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE). The conditions for analyzing FF tissues using the CODEX platform do not result in effective antibody staining for FFPE tissues. The goal of the research outlined in this grant proposal is to develop conditions and methodologies that enable the analysis of FFPE tissues with the CODEX platform. This will increase the overall applicability of the technology and drastically increase the customer base for Akoya Biosciences Inc. We plan to use the information learned in this Phase SBIR I grant proposal to develop antibody panels validated for FFPE tissues that will be commercialized. This greater development effort will be the focus of a follow-on Phase II SBIR grant application."
"9426647","Abstract  Congenital heart diseases are the most common type of human birth defects, and many of these diseases feature structural abnormalities that emerge during development. In order to meet an increasing physiological demand of the growing embryo, the developing heart undergoes complex morphogenetic changes to optimize its ventricular myoarchitecture for more efficient contraction. This proposal is focused on ventricular maturation that is characterized by the formation of muscular protrusions called cardiac trabeculae. Our prior studies revealed that cardiac trabeculation is initiated by directional cardiomyocyte migration from the compact layer, and that ErbB2 cell-autonomously regulates this process. We also found that biomechanical forces generated by the functioning embryonic heart is required for cardiac trabeculation. However, several outstanding questions remain to be addressed, including those related to 1) the mechanism by which mechanical stimulus is sensed and translated into spatial and temporal signals to regulate cardiac trabeculation and 2) the exact function of cardiac trabeculae in the heart. It has been recognized that there exists an intimate relationship between cardiac function and cardiac form. In this research program, we hypothesize that mechanical-biochemical interaction is essential for cardiac trabecular formation and induces pathological hypertrophic remodeling in the absence of trabecular formation. In support of this hypothesis, we found that primary cilia-mediated flow sensing is required for trabeculation through activation of Notch signaling in the ventricular endocardium. While biomechanical forces are required to initiate trabeculation, our preliminary study also revealed an essential role of cardiac trabeculae in handling the mechanical forces generated by cardiac contraction. To test our hypothesis, we propose to further delineate the mechanical-biochemical cellular signaling responsible for 1) trabecular formation, and 2) cardiac dysfunction due to trabecular malformation. The successful completion of this proposal will not only define the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ventricular maturation but also provide further mechanistic insight into the inter-relationship between cardiac function and cardiac form."
"9522814","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Master of Science in Occupational Health degree - Industrial Hygiene program ((MSOH-IH) was originally founded in 1985 and currently is offered by the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine in the College of Medicine and Life Sciences at the University of Toledo Health Science Campus. This IH Program has been continuously accredited by the Applied Science Accreditation Commission - Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ASAC-ABET) for full (6- year) cycles since1996; with the last cycle approved for the period 2014-2020. The primary goal of the Program is to provide master-level education and training to full- and part-time graduate students and members of the public for the purpose of increasing their knowledge, comprehension, skills and attitudes essential to the advancement of occupational health and safety science, practice and research. This is accomplished via a combination of theoretical, practical and applied (i.e. case-based; problem-based) classroom, laboratory, and field teaching and research activities. The program educates and trains individuals mainly from Northwest Ohio region. In turn, graduates are employed as occupational health and safety specialists in the region. In addition, the program accepts students from outside the region and several alumni are employed in other areas throughout the USA, Canada, and Middle East countries. The Industrial Hygiene program adopted the ABET definition for Program Educational Objectives, that is, what the program graduates will be qualified to practice at the time of graduation and what most graduates will be able to achieve (e.g. certification; advanced degree; job promotion) a few years after graduation. The three Program Educational Objectives for the MSOH-IH program are: (1) AII graduates are expected to be qualified to practice comprehensive industrial hygiene. (2) Most graduates are expected to practice in the field of Industrial Hygiene or related areas of Environmental and/or Occupational Health and Safety and to meet the relevant and appropriate needs of their employers. (3) When eligible, based on degrees and post-graduate work experience (i.e. 4 years post-graduation), most graduates who pursue applicable certification in occupational health and safety (i.e. CIH; CSP; CHMM) will pass. The program is designed to educate and train 15-20 full-time (FT) or part-time (PT) students (~8 FTE) per year, with funding requested for the FT equivalent of 5 NIOSH trainees per year. Because the applicants to our Program are usually employed full-time and our classes are offered in the evenings and Saturdays, the NIOSH originally allowed us to award the scholarships to both FT and PT students. Since the last round of TPG funding (2009-2014) of the Program by NIOSH/CDC, the program has graduated 25 industrial hygienists (25/5=5/yr); 15 of those (60%; 3/yr), FT or PT, have been awarded scholarship from the funding. The program expects 16-17 IH students to be enrolled in the Program during the Fall semester 2014. As documented in this application, the IH program (a core discipline) at the University of Toledo has filled a critical gap in the Northwest Ohio workforce needs. ."
"9465330","ABSTRACT This project will create the first objective measurement tool, the VisBox, for the vision subtype of concussion (VSC). This will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye-care professional, for referral to a vision specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendations. The persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties. A lack of accessible, objective vision diagnostics are critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatment. The VisBox will be a software product that is used with the OcuTracker, Oculogica?s proprietary eye-tracking hardware platform. The VisBox will input eye movement measurements from the OcuTracker, calculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve function affected during a concussion, and use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this study. The VisBox will be used by non- vision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussion: convergence insufficiency (CI), accommodative insufficiency (AI), and saccadic dysfunction (SD) in under 4 minutes, during the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosed. The long-term goal is to develop an objective assessment of vision characteristics, that will enable physicians that are non-specialists in vision to 1) screen for concussion-related vision disorders; 2) identify VSC; 3) make decisions about the necessity of a referral for a comprehensive vision examination; 4) monitor the effectiveness of vision treatment. Phase I Hypothesis. VisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBI- related vision disorder, i.e., VSC, by leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking system. Specific Aim I. Generate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI-related vision disorder in 250 pediatric concussion patients. Specific Aim II. Develop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CI, AI, and SD using OcuTracker data. Plans for Phase II. The VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective randomized clinical study. Phase II will be a multi-armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive to vision therapy. Commercial Opportunity. VisBox customers are non-eye care specialists including neurologists, pediatricians, emergency room physicians, sports medicine physicians, and concussion specialists. The total addressable market is $400M, assuming 4M annual scans at $100/scan needed for concussions in the US."
"9520841","Project Summary:  Ovarian cancer (OCa) is the fifth leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States. Intrinsically resistant and recurring ovarian cancers are a terminal disease that cannot be cured with existing therapeutics. Considering the molecular and genetic heterogeneity of tumors, we hypothesize that efficacious OCa therapy can be developed by determining the genetic abnormalities found in tumors of individual OCa patients and designing personalized therapy that can overcome patient-specific multi-drug resistance (MDR). We propose to develop robust nanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) for the co-delivery of front-line and second-line OCa chemotherapeutics (cisplatin or cisplatin plus gemcitabine) and siRNA cocktails targeting MDR genes. A unique endosomal escape mechanism will be elucidated and is expected to be generally applicable to the rational design of nanocarriers for efficient delivery of biologics in vivo. This project will not only provide new fundamental insights nanomedicine research, but also holds great promise for clinical translation for the personalized treatment of resistant OCa. Aim 1: Develop NCP/siRNAs and evaluate their in vitro effects on resistant OCa cell lines. Two NCP/siRNAs formulations with chemotherapeutics in the core and siRNAs targeting MDR in the shell will be developed and characterized. The in vitro gene silencing and cytotoxicity will be evaluated in resistant OCa cells. Aim 2: Evaluate the anticancer efficacy of NCP/siRNAs in orthotopic mouse tumor models of resistant OCa. The general toxicity and anticancer efficacy of NCP/siRNAs will be assessed in mouse models. Aim 3: Actively target NCP/siRNAs by incorporating Her2/neu antibody fragments into the NCP/siRNAs shell. Small protein Her2/neu antibody fragments will be conjugated to a lipid and incorporated into the outer shell of NCP/siRNAs and the resulting nanoparticles will be tested in Her2/neu high expressing and Her2/neu low expressing resistant OCa tumor models to evaluate changes in pharmacokinetics, tumor deposition, and efficacy. Aim 4: Evaluate the anticancer efficacy of NCP/siRNAs and NCP/siRNAs/H2A in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models of resistant OCa. The expression of MDR-associated genes will be analyzed in OCa tumor PDX samples collected by the Mayo clinic. Personalized therapy will be designed entailing chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the choice of siRNAs targeting MDR genes. Confirmed platinum-resistant tumor cells will be used to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of NCP/siRNAs in orthotopic PDX OCa mouse models. Tumors from Her-2/neu receptor positive and negative patients will be further evaluated for anticancer efficacy by NCP/siRNAs/H2A.  Through these aims we seek to establish a new paradigm for the treatment of resistant OCa. NCP/siRNAs can provide personalized therapy for OCa patients and achieve greatly enhanced anticancer efficacy in resistant OCa. As the standards of care for cervical and other cancers, cisplatin-based NCP/siRNAs can have broad impact on treating other resistant cancers."

"9425844","PROJECT SUMMARY Neonatal pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious condition that affects up to one third of premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This entity, known as BPD-associated PH (BPD-PH), is fully established by 1-3 months of age and incurs a four-fold increased risk of death. Survivors of BPD-PH have prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations, and are at risk for chronic cardiopulmonary and metabolic problems. We are committed to developing targeted strategies to prevent BPD-PH in premature infants. Two promising therapeutic targets are the histologic marker, placental maternal vascular underperfusion (MVU) and the intermediate cord blood-derived fetal monocytes (iMNC) that circulate at birth. Our central hypothesis is that fetal iMNCs are adversely programmed by the chronic fetal hypoxia of placental MVU, and contribute to early delayed lung angiogenesis leading to BPD-PH. In Aim #1, we will elucidate the mechanism by which MVU leads to delayed neonatal angiogenesis. Using fetal growth restriction (FGR, birth weight <5th percentile) as the proxy for chronic fetal hypoxia, we will compare iMNC VEGFR1 expression via flow cytometric analysis of 100 cord blood samples from the following groups of infants: 1) preterm MVU with FGR; 2) preterm MVU without FGR; 3) preterm no MVU with FGR; 4) preterm no MVU no FGR (preterm control); 5) term no MVU no FGR (term control). In isolated iMNCs, we will use PCR Array to compare the gene expression profiles of these groups and identify novel gene targets and pathways driven by MVU. In Aim #2 we will identify the perinatal mechanisms by which MVU-exposed fetal iMNCs contribute to delayed neonatal lung angiogenesis: In cultured iMNCs exposed to experimental hypoxia and hyperoxia, we will evaluate VEGFA and VEGFR1 gene and protein expression. We will perform chemotaxis assays to compare iMNC migration in response to exogenous treatment with placental growth factor (PIGF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), and we will compare iMNC expression of VEGFR1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from intubated preterm infants. Lastly, in Aim #3 we will transplant iMNCs from the 5 patient groups into newborn human GM-CSF knock-in (humanized) mice, and follow the lung histology and PH parameters after chronic hyperoxia exposure (85% oxygen x 14 days). We will test the hypothesis that transplantation of cord blood-derived iMNCs from non-MVU, non-FGR infants (controls) will aid in the prevention of BPD-PH."
"9497038","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) causes profound loss of quality of life and over $10B of expense to the US healthcare system annually. Treatment options are primarily limited to corticosteroids, antibiotics and surgery. CRS is conventionally divided into two major forms, one without nasal polyp formation (CRSsNP), and one with nasal polyp formation (CRSwNP). A particularly severe form of CRSwNP is Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD). Patients with AERD suffer from both nasal polyposis and asthma, usually in severe forms. The fundamental hypothesis to be tested by this proposal is that a combination of defects in the immune barrier along with activation of inflammatory and structural cells drives pathogenesis in CRS and AERD. Secondary central goals of this proposal include advancement of our knowledge of pathogenesis of CRSwNP and AERD, development of a new microparticle (MP) based tool for diagnosis of AERD and assessment of the importance of hormones and cytokines in epithelial activation in CRS pathogenesis. We will use a combination of large, robust studies of patients undergoing surgery for CRS and cutting edge laboratory-based and bioinformatics approaches to study CRS pathogenic mechanisms. The proposed work is divided into three specific aims. In the first aim, we will test the hypothesis that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a hallmark feature of CRSwNP reflecting underlying endocrine disturbances and associates with severity and outcomes in CRSwNP. We will relate the extent of EMT in epithelial scrapings from CRSwNP, AERD and controls to disease endpoints to test our hypotheses that hormonal changes, Oncostatin M and Epiregulin play important roles in CRS- associated EMT and CRS pathogenesis. In the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that inflammatory leukocytes, structural cells and mast cells are activated in CRSwNP and AERD and contribute to symptoms and disease activity. We will use an innovative MP assay combined with flow cytometry and RNASeq (Drop-Seq) to assess activation of basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, endothelial cells and epithelial cells in controls and patients with CRSwNP or AERD. We will relate cell activation to disease severity assessed using CT, endoscopy, treatment history, questionnaires and tissue pathology. We will link inflammatory endpoints to EMT and important clinical endpoints. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that greater activation of eosinophils, basophils, mast cells and platelets explains the greater severity of disease in AERD. In aim three, we will use the MP assay to identify patients with undiagnosed AERD among a large cohort of patients with CRSwNP and comorbid asthma. We will confirm or eliminate diagnosis of AERD with aspirin challenge to validate the MP test. These studies will advance knowledge of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of CRS and AERD and bring us closer to new diagnostics and therapeutic interventions."
"9452489","Burkholderia mallei and B. pseudomallei are bacterial pathogens and causative agents of glanders and melioidosis, respectively. At present, effective vaccines for prevention of glanders or meliodosis have not been developed. However, renewed attention has been directed toward development of Burkholderia vaccines because of the pathogens' seemingly ideal characteristics for malicious use as a biowarfare weapon. Additionally, a vaccine will also have significant value for the immunization of at-risk populations in melioidosis/glanders endemic areas of the world. Therefore, our long-term goal is to develop a platform that allows for the efficient generation of a multicomponent vaccine which is able to protect against both glanders and melioidosis. Our approach will use glycoconjugates coupled to gold nanoparticles (NP) and test their protective properties in clinically relevant models of infection. The central hypothesis tested indicates that protein antigens of B. mallei or B. pseudomallei coupled to NP polysaccharides will elicit protection in relevant mammalian species, and that these antigens will correlate with clinically important serologic/immunologic readouts. The hypothesis will be evaluated by developing different protein-polysaccharide NPs and comparing their efficacy in vivo. The flexible NP platform will allow us to additionally incorporate novel antigens identified by other groups as further enhancing protective immunity. We will establish an optimal immunization procedure and test the efficacies of protein-polysaccharide NPs in a clinically relevant and highly controlled aerosol murine model of infection. Finally, we aim to identify the correlates/biomarkers of protection induced by protein- polysaccharide NP vaccination. This proposal is innovative because it capitalizes on the use of a subunit-NP vaccine, which could be easily licensable because of its lower cost and more widely disseminated vaccinations for at-risk populations. Together, these outcomes will help us to identify correlates of protection from protein- polysaccharide nanoparticles and provide optimized vaccination strategies."
"9461923","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Brain tumor is the leading cause of solid tumor death in children and one of the top leading causes of cancer death in young male and female adults with ages of 20-39 . Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults with an overall incidence of 20% of all primary brain tumors. Despite current standard of care, which includes surgery and chemo-radiation, the median survival is only 14.6 months. Due to the highly invasive nature of GBM cells, standard treatment with gross total resection of the tumor is insufficient to achieve a cure because of the high rate of recurrence by tumor cells outside the tumor resection margins. Moreover, there is an unmet need in the ability of clinicians to identify patients with lower survival times and high risk of recurrence. Developing novel prognostic tools for determining patient survival and for identifying cell subpopulations that have a significantly increased motility and aggressiveness, and drive recurrence is of utmost importance. Intriguing data based on a retrospective study of our GBM patients reveal that: 1) our novel Microfluidic Invasion Network Device (MIND) predicts survival in GBM patients based on the increased percentage of invasive cells in the heterogeneous population; 2) we are able to separate the invasive from non-invasive cell using MIND device, which will allow us to understand the underlying molecular differences of the more aggressive subpopulations; 3) the targetable transcription factor TEAD4 is selectively overexpressed and hyperactive in GBM and promotes confined GBM migration. In light of these findings, we propose to: i) establish our MIND platform as an adjunct tool to the clinical management of GBM patients prospectively, ii) uncover novel drivers of GBM cell invasion, and iii) utilize it as a high-throughput assay for screening potential therapeutic drugs. To achieve these goals, we will pursue the following specific aims: to determine the prognostic power of confined space migration in a prospective cohort of GBM patients using MIND (Aim 1); to characterize the molecular drivers of confined space migration of phenotypically aggressive brain cancer cells using MIND (Aim 2); to evaluate the in vivo translational efficacy of 42 chemotherapeutic agents tested in MIND (Aim 3). In vitro experiments will be conducted using prospectively collected patient-derived primary GBM cell lines from over 100 patients. Our proprietary and novel MIND platform will be used to study confined- space migration from these patients to identify poor prognosis and high recurrence prospectively with the future goal of achieving personalized treatments for patients. In vivo studies will be conducted using our established orthotopic human brain tumor initiating cell-derived GBM model in mice. The results obtained from this study will to lead to the development of a platform for precision medicine with the ability to test drugs in a high throughput fashion using freshly isolated human tissue."
"9466839","PROJECT SUMMARY  The long-term objective of this application is to bring a trachea patch to the market to treat tracheal stenosis, or narrowing of the airway, which left untreated is a life-threatening condition that affects both young children and adults. Currently, otolaryngologists have only two major options for treating tracheal stenosis. One is a complex surgical procedure known as slide tracheoplasty that few surgeons in the country are truly qualified to perform. The other is to open the trachea wider and hold it open with a graft of rib cartilage. Both are difficult, time-consuming procedures with potential complications.  We have a U.S. patent application submitted on a trachea patch biomaterial that overcomes the four major technical hurdles required to replace rib cartilage grafting: 1) mechanical integrity, 2) suturable, 3) resorbable, and 4) air-tight. There is currently nothing on the market even remotely resembling the idea of a synthetic patch for tracheal stenosis. While the academic tissue engineering community has focused primarily on regenerating an entire trachea with highly complex strategies, arguably leading to technology in search of an application, we have focused instead on identifying a specific patient indication with an unmet need and designed a technology to fill that void.  Co-inventors Weatherly and Detamore have worked together for a decade, and after preliminary studies in 38 rabbits and 5 sheep, and partnering with Nanofiber Solutions in 2012, together as a team we are at an inflection point where key refinements of the technology are crucial to moving forward to a Phase II SBIR project and then onward to the clinic. The chief hypothesis is that refinement within the device realm will improve airway opening relative to the original device. We have three parallel aims to test in a single in vivo study with rabbits, each testing a different, more specific hypothesis regarding solutions to improve the technology. The Specific Aims are to test the hypotheses that each of the following will improve airway opening: 1) a faster-degrading polymer, 2) a more favorable biomaterial- cell interaction, and 3) an anti-microbial peptide.  Compared to rib cartilage grafting, our trachea patch holds the following advantages: 1) No surgery to remove rib tissue, saving operating room time and cost, and eliminating potential complication/infection and morbidity at the rib site (attractive to patients and insurance companies), 2) Easy to use, as it is ?plug and play? for surgeons who perform rib cartilage grafting (attractive to surgeons), 3) No biologics or drugs are required (attractive to investors for FDA approval). For several reasons, we focus initial clinical translation on the pediatric population with laryngotracheal stenosis. In the simplest terms, our goal is to fix tracheas for kids around the world with narrowed airways to help them survive and breathe normally again."
"9414679","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High quality, real-time data is essential in public health crises. Yet, traditional survey methods that rely on random-digit-dialing are expensive, difficult to deploy instantly, and fail to sample hard-to-reach populations without landline telephones, such as young adults (18-30) and minorities. In contrast, these groups heavily use social media. Twitter, in particular, is widely available and immediate, providing a rich data source that can be used to pilot hypotheses at minimal cost. These hypotheses can then be modified prior to a more in-depth study. Social media data pose challenges for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data. We will therefore develop and test an innovative computational tool that overcomes these challenges. This tool will supplement traditional survey techniques by facilitating real-time data gathering and rigorous quantitative analysis of social media data related to health narratives, attitudes, and behaviors. We will validate our tool by comparing existing survey data to social media data about influenza vaccination among adults 18-30, adult African Americans, and non-White Hispanics of all ages - three demographic categories with the highest rates of social media use, lower rates of participation in survey research, and lowest rates of seasonal flu vaccination. Thus, our tool will enable theory building. We will test hypotheses derived from the health communication literature, especially regarding how group attitudes form and change, categorize attitudes and collective narratives by existing theories and conceptual models, and build new theory to capture emerging and previously unidentified concepts. Finally, we disseminate our results and novel techniques using a website, vaccinetrends.org, that provides processed social media data to the research community. Our approach offers inexpensive, immediate access to the attitudes of these groups, transcending traditional constraints of time, money, and data access. Our approach is novel because it combines the strengths of social media analysis with those of validated survey techniques. We will draw upon two complementary population samples, representing different timescales and demographics, in order to test hypotheses in a manner that is rapid yet rigorous. In addition, our social media analysis will draw upon novel techniques to infer demographic information and social group membership, enabling the extraction of master narratives - attitudes and content that are associated with rationales for vaccine refusal and, ultimately, behavior. In addition, we will develop tools and techniques that can be adopted by researchers throughout the social, computer, and health sciences. Finally, we draw upon a much more extensive data source than has been found in previous work, including billions of Twitter messages and public forum information that will enable in-depth automated content analysis of vaccine refusal rationales."
"9350144","Military environmental exposures are pervasive in Iraq and Afghanistan, including particulate air pollution levels that are 10 times higher than urban cities in the United States. Although a causal relationship is unclear, respiratory symptoms are frequently reported both during and following deployment, and deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan is associated with an increased risk of respiratory conditions. Despite the presence of symptoms, the majority of Veterans have normal lung volumes and airflows as detected by spirometry. However, spirometry may be insensitive in this population and does not assess the primary function of the lung which is gas-exchange. Gas-exchange is assessed at rest via the measurement of lung diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), and our preliminary data suggest that DLCO is commonly reduced in Veterans despite normal spirometry. The pattern of normal lung volumes and airflows but low DLCO ? i.e., an isolated reduction in DLCO ? suggests early pulmonary vascular or parenchymal lung disease. An isolated reduction in DLCO has previously been reported in exposure-related bronchiolar disorders, including a case series of active duty soldiers with dyspnea on exertion. We hypothesize that exposure to particulate air pollution during deployment results in deposition of small particles in the distal airways, resulting in focal pulmonary vascular injury, release of vasoactive mediators and systemic vascular dysfunction which manifests as respiratory symptoms and dyspnea on exertion. Our aims are: Aim 1) To non-invasively assess resting and exercise gas-exchange as well as the pulmonary hemodynamic response to incremental and maximal exercise, and Aim 2) To identify systemic markers of vascular injury, including circulating levels of vasoactive mediators and systemic vascular reactivity. Pulmonologists in the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense have recognized the biggest challenge in evaluating post-deployment respiratory symptoms is the individual with normal spirometry; therefore, we will focus on this group of post-9/11 Veterans. Specifically, we will recruit two groups of Veterans with normal lung volumes and airflows, but with (Normal PFT) and without reduced DLCO (Low DLCO). By classifying Veterans into groups based on pulmonary function patterns (Normal PFT vs. Low DLCO), we will be able to discern whether an isolated reduction in DLCO is an unusual variant or a harbinger of deployment- related lung disease. To complement our aims, we will conduct exploratory follow-up evaluations (annually over the duration of the award) on a subset of Veterans to determine how pulmonary vascular function and systemic markers of subclinical pulmonary vascular disease progress over time. Through these studies, we expect to uncover new knowledge about deployment-related respiratory disease as well as the short- and long- term consequences of military environmental exposures, which may facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic post-9/11 Veterans."
"9441311","Abstract There is growing evidence that moderate exposure to alcohol during development can lead to behavioral and cognitive deficits that can persist throughout the lifespan. Cognitive impairments associated with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) include abnormalities in learning and memory, executive control and social behaviors and are often characterized by a hyper-focus on one particular task or aspect of a task, to the detriment of other important behaviors. We have recently shown that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can impair executive control in adulthood and that behavioral impairments are accompanied by significant alterations in coherence in the orbitofrontal cortex during choice. Both behavioral deficits and cortical alterations are found when GluN2B subunit containing N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptors (NMDAR) are lost in the OFC. Given preliminary data that GluN2B is significantly reduced in the OFC after PAE, we propose to investigate whether impairments in behavioral flexibility are driven by alterations in cortical coherence mediated by alterations in NMDAR expression and function and whether these deficits can be rescued. We propose to integrate a well-established voluntary drinking paradigms for moderate PAE with touch-screen behavioral assays, in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology and optogenetic stimulation. First, we will express channel rhodopsin (ChR2) in the cortex of PAE and SAC mice and examine whether direct stimulation will rescue behavioral flexibility impairments in PAE mice. Next, given evidence that GluN2B is downregulated after PAE and that his subunit contributes to establishing cortical coherence, we will investigate whether behavioral deficits in the model are mediated by alterations in GluN2B subunit expression and recruitment required to induce plasticity and support behavioral flexibility. Finally, we will examine whether changes in connectivity between OFC and dS drives asynchrony and perseveration. We will use retrograde expression to fluorescently tag OFC-dS neurons and characterize function of NMDAR via ex vivo slice physiology. Then we will utilize retrograde expression of ChR2 to test if stimulation restricted to OFC-dS neurons is sufficient to rescue the behavioral deficits. Taken together the completion of these aims will elucidate the mechanisms of cognitive impairment in FASD and provide an important tool for developing more effective therapies for executive dysfunction."
"9541550","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Neurological disorders such as Alzheimer?s disease, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and schizophrenia impact important cognitive processes and behavior. While the symptoms of these severe diseases vary, they share disruptions in synapse development or spine formation4. Dendritic spines are small, dynamic, post- synaptic protrusions on neurons that respond to changes in presynaptic activity1. Although spine dynamics have been well studied, very little is known about the genes involved in spine formation and maintenance. Recently, my laboratory discovered spiny projections on a group of GABAergic neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using C. elegans as a model system, the goal of this project is to dissect cellular and molecular components important for dendritic spine formation and maintenance. Specifically, in the first aim, I will define the structural dynamics, and cellular components that drive development and maintenance of these spine-like protrusions. In my second aim, I will utilize findings from a genome-wide genetic screen to investigate the role of unc-14, a cargo adaptor protein in these spine-like structures, and elucidate the molecular identity and functions of 2 additional spine mutants, 21-6-1K and 31-6-1G2. Given the strong homology between C. elegans and mammalian genes, I expect that my approach will identify conserved mechanisms underlying dendritic spine formation. These studies will address fundamental questions about dendritic spine biology and offer valuable training in microscopy, genetics, and molecular approaches that will advance my scientific development and provide a foundation for my future scientific endeavors."
"9606769","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polycystic kidney diseases (PKD) are a group of inherited nephropathies characterized by the formation of fluid-filled cysts along the nephron. Autosomal Recessive form of PKD (ARPKD) has an incidence of 1 in 20,000 live births; infants with this disease that survive beyond the perinatal period develop chronic renal failure by adolescence and eventually require kidney transplantation. This proposal focuses on the sodium transport regulation in the renal collecting ducts in ARPKD and potential means of pharmacological intervention with the cysts' progression. Specifically, we have determined that Epithelial Sodium Channels (ENaCs), which are expressed in the collecting ducts and represent the rate-limiting step of sodium reabsorption in this nephron segment, are involved into the process of cystogenesis in the ARPKD setting. Our preliminary data indicate that ENaC expression and activity are significantly lower in the cystic epithelial cells of a rat model of ARPKD, as assessed with immunohistochemistry and single channel analysis in isolated cysts; furthermore, chronic administration of the ENaC-specific inhibitor, benzamil, aggravated cyst formation. Thus, we propose that ENaC inhibition exacerbates PKD progression. Using a novel enzymatic microbiosensors approach we established that concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was significantly higher in PCK rat cortical cysts compared to control rats. ATP was shown to inhibit ENaC via signaling cascades initiated by binding to its receptors. Therefore, we hypothesize here that accumulation of excessive levels of ATP in the lumen of the dilated collecting ducts affects specific purinergic receptors in the cystic cells (primary candidates being P2Y2 or P2X7) and results in ENaC inhibition; this suppresses normal sodium reabsorption in these collecting ducts, and thus promotes fluid accumulation and cysts' expansion. The integrative experimental approach used in this study will include single nephron electrophysiology, in vivo animal studies, genetics, biochemistry, biosensors amperometry and confocal microscopy and will address the clinically relevant problem of cyst expansion in ARPKD. Specifically, this proposal will identify the involvement of the ATP- triggered signaling into regulation of sodium reabsorption in this setting. This proposal will address the following specific aims: 1. Determine the relationship between ENaC activity and cystogenesis in ARPKD; 2. Elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanism by which excessive levels of ATP modulate sodium transport, promoting cyst growth; and 3. Explore if P2 receptor agonists/antagonists and suppression of the ATP levels can affect cystogenesis."
"9439640","Aberrant signal transduction resulting from dysregulated phosphorylation is a hallmark of human cancer. Targeted cancer therapies are predominantly inhibitors of oncogenic kinases. While these drugs have had some clinical success, an alternative approach ? inactivation of kinase signaling by stimulating endogenous phosphatases ? has received minimal attention. Recently, our group has developed a novel series of small molecule activators of the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a negative regulator of multiple oncogenic signaling proteins, as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancers. PP2A is a heterotrimeric complex whose substrate specificity is dependent on one of 23 different regulatory subunits that can bind to form over 60 distinct holoenzyme complexes. Broad inhibition of holoenzyme formation using specific PP2A inhibitors, specifically the overexpression of the small T antigen of the SV40 tumor virus, renders cells resistant to SMAP therapy. This suggests that the formation of PP2A trimeric complexes is necessary for SMAP activity. However, from these studies the specific role of individual regulatory subunits in regulating the biological effects of SMAP activation of PP2A remains unclear. Preliminary data generated by targeted knockdown of a series of PP2A regulatory subunits demonstrated that specific subunit knockdown of PR72 attenuated SMAP activity in both cellular and in vivo models systems. Specifically, targeted reduction of PR72 but not B55 and B56 regulatory subunit family members resulted in blunted induction of PARP cleavage in SMAP treated cells. Additionally, stable PR72 knockdown resulted in abrogation of SMAP activity in a H358 xenograft model. Collectively, this data suggests that the PR72 regulatory subunit plays a critical role in small molecule mediated activation of PP2A's tumor suppressive activity. Here we propose to test the role of a single PP2A regulatory subunit, PR72, in mediating PP2A-dependent apoptosis using gain and loss of function experiments. The three interconnected specific aims are specifically directed at (1) determining the dependence on PR72 for PP2A-mediated cell death, (2) determining the signaling events regulated by the PR72 holoenzymes, and (3) defining the effect of SMAP binding to PP2A on PR72 holoenzyme stability."
"9468136","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Mobile Genetic Elements and Genome Plasticity organized by Drs. Marlene Belfort, Evan E. Eichler, Henry L. Levin and Lynne E. Maquat. The conference will be held February 11 -15, 2018 at the Eldorado Hotel & Spa in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Transposable elements are potent sources of genetic variation that also regulate the expression of large gene networks. They constitute the majority of genomic DNA in many eukaryotes, and they dramatically shape genetic content by causing insertions, deletions, rearrangements and sequence duplications. Of increasing significance is the link of these mobile elements to diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Sequencing of human populations demonstrates that active transposable elements are substantially more prevalent than previously appreciated. The aims of this conference are to: 1) Apply recent innovations in high-throughput sequencing and genome analysis to the study of transposon biology and genome dynamics; 2) Discuss the discovery of cellular systems that inhibit transposon activity as examples of the evolutionary arms race between mobile DNA and their hosts; 3) Describe active transposition during neurogenesis and in tumor cells and raise questions about the role of mobile DNA in brain development and cancer; and 4) Discern mechanistic aspects of element mobility from bacteria to humans. This symposium will foster ties between leaders in the field of transposon function and biology with the pioneers of genome analysis, a link that is still tenuous and nascent. Discussions of transposon activity and genome dynamics will focus on mechanistic models. Methods applied to these problems will include molecular structures, biochemistry, expression studies and bioinformatic analyses. The transposons and hosts represented in this meeting include diverse examples from eubacteria, archaea, protists, plants and mammals."
"9444103","SUMMARY Chronic lung disease, including fibrosis, is the fourth leading cause of mortality worldwide. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a debilitating pathology that impedes overall tissue function. A common comorbidity in fibrosis is vasculopathy, characterized by remodeling and loss of microvessels, which substantially worsens prognosis and limits survival, most current therapeutic strategies being largely palliative. The relevance of neovascularization to the pathophysiology of fibrosis has never been resolved as conflicting evidence depicts angiogenesis as both, reparative or pathologic. Therefore, we must begin to understand and model the underlying pathobiology of PVD, alone and with fibrosis, to define cell interactions necessary to maintain normal function and promote repair. We have identified a novel model of vasculopathy dependent on the function of adult pulmonary resident mesenchymal pericyte progenitors (ABCG2pos MPC). The MPC regulate microvascular function during tissue homeostasis and the extent of vasculopathy in lung tissue. Therefore, lung MPC is a previously unstudied target that should be exploited to identify new mechanisms and therapeutic targets relevant to the pathobiology of PVD associated with fibrosis. A premise for this proposal is that that ABCG2pos lung MPC are key constituents of the microvascular niche, as such, disrupted ABCG2pos MPC differentiation accounts in part for the deregulation of microvessel function and remodeling associated with PVD and exacerbation of fibrosis. We hypothesize that ABCG2posMPC regulated loss of microvessel function drives the development of persistent vasculopathy, which exacerbates the onset and development of fibrosis in the lung. In this proposal, we will test that activation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling in MPC exacerbates the onset and persistence of fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. We hypothesize that MPC derived DKK1 modulates MPC-MVEC interactions via regulation of direct cell - cell communication and paracrine effects on MVEC function. We will also test that modulation of DKK1 expression and signaling activity in ABCG2pos MPC will restore microvascular function and attenuate fibrosis. Both in vivo and in vitro we will repurpose drugs currently approved and utilized as chemotherapeutic agents with WT, IPF, PVD MPC & murine models. Successful completion of the proposed studies will define the therapeutic potential for targeting the Dkk1/Lrp6 signaling pathway identified in MPC to restore microvessel function and decrease fibrotic remodeling. We are poised to complete these studies with combined expertise and tools specific to our group."
"9415411","Project Abstract  Many psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, depression, and autism, are associated with disrupted sleep. Disrupted sleep may contribute to negative cognitive symptoms, as sleep is crucial for maintaining and restoring healthy brain function. In particular, the slow (0.1-1 Hz) oscillations characteristic of deep sleep are thought to play essential roles in the restorative functions of sleep, and these oscillations have complex spatial properties that may be important for their effects on cognition. However, determining how slow oscillations influence brain function has been challenging due to our current inability to measure slow oscillations with spatial precision throughout the whole brain.  This project exploits the recent development of accelerated multi-slice imaging methods to measure fast (>0.2 Hz) fMRI signals. This work is centered around an innovative use of accelerated fMRI with simultaneous EEG to directly measure slow oscillation dynamics throughout the human brain simultaneously, and use this information to create the first whole-brain maps of slow oscillations. We will first optimize imaging and analysis methods for localizing slow oscillations. We will then test a hypothesis for how slow oscillations affect cognitive function: namely, that spatially localized slow oscillations in cortex and thalamus lead to reorganized information transfer across cortical networks, and thereby influence cognitive function.  The candidate has expertise in systems neuroscience of arousal regulation, anesthesia pharmacology, electrophysiology, and signal processing, providing a strong foundation for conducting this advanced imaging study of sleep states. The K99 will provide necessary training in 1) functional and anatomical MRI; 2) simultaneous EEG-fMRI during sleep; and 3) human sleep neurophysiology. The research will take place at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center, a highly collaborative environment equipped with state-of-the-art facilities for neuroimaging. The primary mentor Prof. Bruce Rosen will provide mentorship in neuroimaging and in transitioning to an independent position. In addition, the co-mentor Prof. Robert Stickgold will provide training in sleep neurophysiology, as well as exposure to clinical contexts of how sleep is affected in psychiatric disorders, and how disrupted sleep can contribute to cognitive deficits. Additional advice from Dr. Jonathan Polimeni and Dr. Jeff Duyn on imaging and analysis techniques will ensure high-level training in these methodological approaches. This methodological and scientific training will enable the candidate both to successfully complete these aims and to develop an independent research program focused on the systems neuroscience of sleep and arousal regulation, how sleep circuits and sleep-modulating pharmaceutical agents influence cortical function, and how sleep deficits lead to disrupted cognition. The results of this research will contribute to improved methods for imaging dynamics in the human brain, and shed light on the effects of sleep deprivation, which have significant negative effects both on the general population and particularly in patients with psychiatric disorders."
"9499766","Abstract  Cellular RNAs can serve as powerful biomarkers of diverse disease states. Recent developments in probe technology enable the detection of RNAs with single-molecule sensitivity by fluorescence in situ hybridization (sm-FISH). This technology holds great promise in clinical diagnostics for the detection of pathogens and cancers. However, its utility for imaging pathological sections is presently limited, because in order to obtain single-molecule sensitivity, imaging needs to be performed with high magnification objectives that have a limited field of view, permitting the observation of only a few cells at a time. The relatively low intensity of these signals also limits the utility of sm-FISH when the cells are analyzed by flow cytometry, because rare cells, such as immunological memory cells or stem cells, which express a low level of mRNA markers, cannot be detected. A further limitation is that single nucleotide variations cannot be detected.  We are developing a new generation of sm-FISH in which the signals is amplified without any amplification of background. In our approach, that we refer to as strictly target-dependent amplified FISH (stamp-FISH), when a pair of binary probes bind to the target a sequestered sequence is exposed. The exposed sequence then serves as an initiator of a hybridization chain reaction, which leads to creation of a large, highly fluorescent DNA cluster that remains tethered at the target. We obtain as much as 10-fold amplification of signal without any enhancement in background. Furthermore, the probes yield exquisite discrimination between single nucleotide variations.  We will develop this technology further and apply it for detection of point mutations in EGFR and BRAF mRNAs. Currently, about fifteen percent of the copies of target mRNA that are present within the cells can be detected. We will improve this efficiency using strategies aimed at increasing the binding of probes to the target mRNAs. Probe sets will be developed for an exemplary set of mutations within the EGFR and BRAF genes and then cell lines and cancer tissues, in which these mutations are expressed, will be imaged using these probe sets. We will also develop multiplex assays that will detect three mutants and the wild-type mRNA simultaneously. In addition, for T cell profiling we are proposing to detect 15 RNA markers in multiplex in T cells. With this expansion of the multiplexing range to 15 targets, we will be able to detect subtypes of cells that differ from each other by the expression of chemokine/cytokines, transcription factors, or metabolic markers. This development will create powerful new analytical possibilities for diverse fields in both research and clinical settings and thus will be of broad utility."
"9391617","?     DESCRIPTION:      Current U.S. Veteran demographics reveal an aging population with significant cardiovascular dysfunction. This ultimately manifests as mobility limitation, inactivity, and a subsequent worsening of cardiovascular disease (CVD) that often leads to death. However, despite this clear negative cycle of events, there is not a single clinically accepted, and therefore routinely utilized, method of assessing vascular health. As nitric oxide (NO) is anti- atherogenic and cardioprotective, identifying an in vivo bioassay of NO bioavailability has significant worth in ths arena. Passive leg movement (PLM) and the subsequent blood flow increase, measured non-invasively by ultrasound Doppler in the common femoral artery, is emerging as a method by which vascular endothelial function and therefore NO bioavailability can be determined, however, this method is still in its infancy. Here, we propose the validation and characterization of PLM, as a novel, clinically relevant, method to determine vascular health and guide rehabilitation. With the growing interest in personalized medicine, the development of tools, such as PLM, that allow individualized assessments to guide the physician, the patient, and the rehabilitative team, are essential. Therefore two specific aims are proposed that will address the Central Hypothesis that PLM is an NO-dependent, reproducible, and clinically relevant tool to assess vascular health across the human lifespan. The ultimate goal of the proposed studies will be to assist in catalyzing the transition of the assessment of endothelial function by PLM from research to clinical practice."
"9429077","PROJECT SUMMARY Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a human gamma-herpesvirus, is the causative agent of AIDS malignancies like KS and primary effusion lymphomas (PEL). In recent years it became clear that pathogenic herpesviruses including EBV, KSHV, and MHV68 express numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) many of which are in antisense orientation to protein coding transcripts. The function and structure of these RNAs is largely unknown. In addition, these viruses express microRNAs (miRNAs). While characterizing the KSHV miRNA targetome, we identified several hundred host cellular lncRNAs as putative miRNA targets. Furthermore, infection of endothelial cells with wtKSHV induced dramatic dys-regulation of host lncRNAs including the down-regulation of 533 lncRNAs. Of these 126 were rescued when cells were infected with a KSHV recombinant that lacked 10 of 12 KSHV miRNAs. Together these data strongly suggest that both KSHV encoded proteins and miRNAs contribute to dysregulation of host lncRNAs. Importantly, ten lncRNAs that are perturbed following KSHV infection, including HOTTIP, ANRIL, Meg3, and UCA1 are reported to be associated with human cancers. We demonstrate that up-regulation of UCA1 affects proliferation and migration of KSHV infected endothelial cells. Additionally, we provide experimental evidence that the anti-sense LANA transcript is bound by EZH2/PRC2 complexes and may contribute to the regulation of viral latency. These data suggest that viral lncRNAs are important regulators of viral gene expression and hence may be important for viral pathogenesis and/or tumorigenesis. To understand the role of lncRNAs in viral biology we propose to functionally study viral lncRNAs and to determine underlying mechanisms and phenotypical consequences of host lncRNA dysregulation in KS pathogenesis. Importantly, experimental findings observed in appropriate tissue culture models of lymphoid and endothelial origin, will be validated using clinical specimens from AIDS malignancies in collaboration with Dr. Chris Parsons. Moreover, this project will be performed in close collaboration with Projects 2 (EBV) and 3 (MHV68), with the goal of identifying pathways that are commonly regulated by cancer-associated gamma-herpesvirus lncRNAs. Identifying such common regulatory pathways may point to novel virus-specific therapeutic strategies. We note that to date several miRNA and lncRNA based therapeutics are in different stages of clinical development."
"9392589","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) and tremor.  Additionally, humanitarian device exemptions for dystonia and obsessive-compulsive disorder have been established and studies are underway for depression and epilepsy.  Although a highly successful therapy, there remain many challenges to the field.  One of such challenges is the large number of surgical targets, stimulation settings, and electrode configurations that have to be attempted in the search for therapeutic clinical outcomes.  A wide range of factors such as neurologic state, electrode placement, brain shift, tissue encapsulation, and stimulation parameters can affect the clinical outcomes of DBS.  As such, there is a critical need for DBS systems that can compensate for some of these uncontrollable factors.  For example, by using the brain's dynamic environment to guide electrode placement and stimulation programming, thereby resulting in a DBS system that can be tailored to individual patients and symptoms.  Characterization of electroactive neurochemicals in charge of modulating critical therapeutic neural activity will allow us to use real-time neurotransmitter concentration measurements to identify these optimal locations for electrode placement, as well as to identify optimal stimulation parameters after the electrode has been implanted.  We propose to study the neurochemical dynamics of DBS by characterizing striatal dopamine responses evoked by STN stimulation.  We also propose using these responses to develop a closed-loop system for modulating dopamine concentration.  In Aim 1, we will develop an inexpensive animal model for acute characterization of striatal dopamine release evoked by DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in anesthetized healthy pigs.  In Aim 2, we will use techniques developed using the less-expensive pig model to develop a closed-loop controller for modulating dopamine concentration in healthy anesthetized non-human primates (NHP).  Finally, in Aim 3, we will use a NHP model of PD to develop a neurochemically-mediated closed-loop DBS system for sustained therapeutic response in a dynamic environment.  Characterization of the neurochemical dynamics of dopamine evoked by DBS represents an important step forward toward understanding the underlying mechanisms of DBS.  In the future, closed-loop systems building on the system proposed here will reduce the need for frequent clinical interventions in the form of DBS programming and medication adjustments.  Undoubtedly, this technology will have a profound impact on both basic and clinical neuroscience approaches to the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disease, and will provide the rationale for expanding the neurologic and psychiatric conditions that can be treated with DBS."

"9417792","Role of the Mitochondrial Peptide Humanin in Regulating Aging and Healthspan Diet and the GH/IGF axis are central to aging and longevity. We identified a key role for the novel mitochondrial- derived peptide (MDP), humanin, which is encoded from a small open reading frame (sORF) within the mitochondrial genome (16S rRNA gene) in this regard. Dietary manipulations, administration of H2S-donors, and IGF-I reduction lead to increases in humanin levels, while humanin itself mimics dietary restriction (DR) in multiple ways including suppressing IGF-I, increasing IGFBP-1, improving insulin sensitivity, and reducing weight. Humanin levels fall with age and correlate with lifespan, and humanin overexpression or administration to various organisms leads to healthspan and lifespan extension. Similarly to dietary interventions and H2S, humanin protects from a variety of insults, and its administration prevents the development of diseases of aging. Our collaborative studies with Projects 1 & 3 indicate that humanin is a central connecting link between dietary restriction, IGF reduction, and H2S expression, integrating stress resistance and fitness during aging. Our central hypotheses are (1) humanin is a mitochondrial hormone whose expression is directly regulated by aging-modulating interventions such as dietary manipulations, H2S, and IGF-reduction, (2) Humanin regulates circulating IGF-I (mimicking DR) by direct activity on the hypothalamus leading to a central-hepatic effect that inhibits IGF-I production in liver (3) humanin administration can act similarly to DR and fasting mimicking diets or protein restriction cycles, H2S, and GH/IGF-blockade, to promote healthspan and possibly longevity. We will study the mechanisms by which diet, IGF-I, and H2S regulate humanin expression; and study the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the humanin-sORF. We will decipher the mechanisms involved in the DR-mimetic effects of humanin action through hypothalamic-mediated suppression of hepatic IGF-I; as well as through direct protective effects on target tissues. We will characterize the effects of humanin on healthspan and identify the mechanisms involved, using novel humanin-transgenic mouse models, GP130- inhibitors, and IGF-add-back experiments. Together, this project will demonstrate the physiological significance of humanin as a mediator and regulator of healthspan and longevity pathways including those related to diet, IGF-I, and H2S. We hope to demonstrate that HN is necessary and sufficient for healthspan/lifespan enhancement."
"9394010","Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases."

Successful translation of BCIs to actual clinical use by such people depends on close and productive multidisciplinary interactions, and requires recognition of and attention to a set of crucial issues. The International BCI Meeting Series (1999, 2002, 2005, 2010, 2013 and 2016) convened a wide range of research groups and disciplines vital to BCI research and triggered many productive interactions and collaborations. This proposal, for the Seventh International BCI Meeting: ?BCIs: Not Getting Lost in Translation,? will be organized under the leadership of a Program Committee appointed by the BCI Society. The meeting will encourage and facilitate the development and translation of BCIs into clinically- viable devices through the following specific aims: 1) Convene and foster productive interactions among all the disciplines and constituencies whose cooperation is crucial to successful BCI research and development. No other venue brings them all together. 2) Present a concise and comprehensive update of the current state of BCI research and development. 3) Address in focused workshops the major topics critical for continued progress in BCI research and development. Additional topics of broad interest will be chosen based on workshop proposals and abstracts submitted by participants. 4) Promote the education and development of new researchers through the participation of many graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Networking events will encourage interactions between new and established researchers and particularly target underrepresented groups of researchers. 5) Convene the new BCI Society and encourage the involvement of young scientists in the society. This is crucial to generating new and fresh ideas in addition to translating state-of-the-art BCIs to clinical use. 6) Maximize the immediate and long-term Meeting impact through publication by the journal Brain Computer Interfaces of a special issue of peer-reviewed primary articles and focused reviews derived from the meeting.  In summary, this meeting will assemble scientists, engineers, clinicians and policymakers involved in BCI research and clinical use, review the present state of the field, address key issues critical to further progress, and promote the education and participation of young researchers. This meeting and the resulting comprehensive publications should, like its predecessors, contribute greatly to BCI research and development."
"9541099","Project Summary/Abstract Over the past 20 years, remarkable progress has been made in our understanding of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and of the congenital and acquired neurointestinal diseases that result from abnormal development or maintenance of the ENS. Many of the advances in understanding ENS development have been made by cell, molecular, and developmental biology studies and genetic analyses using a variety of species, including avians, rodents, zebrafish, and humans. These fundamental studies have contributed not only a detailed appreciation of the complexities of ENS development, but are now also yielding novel opportunities to develop cell-based therapies for treating enteric neuropathies. Researchers studying ENS development gathered in New York in 2006 for their first international symposium. This triennial meeting was subsequently held in London (2009), Hong Kong (2012), and Rotterdam (2015). The symposium brings together clinicians and researchers, including developmental and cell biologists, pathologists, geneticists, physiologists, pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons, and stem cell researchers, who all share a common interest in the development and pathophysiology of the enteric nervous system and the diagnosis and treatment of neurointestinal diseases. All of the Symposia have been very successful, each hosting approximately 150 participants from 20 different countries from around the world. The 5th International Symposium on ?Development of the Enteric Nervous System: Cells, Signals, Genes and Therapy? will be held in Boston in April, 2018. This will be the first meeting focused on ENS development to be held in the U.S. in 12 years and builds on the success of the prior meetings and the growing importance of ENS research. The specific aims of this R13 application are as follows: (1) To encourage the participation of young investigators, particularly women and minorities under-represented in science, at this 5th International Symposium by offering 10 Travel Awards to offset registration costs and travel expenses; and (2) To enhance the likelihood of long-term success for young investigators pursuing academic careers by establishing mentored relationships with select faculty and members of the meeting?s Organizing Committee. It is our expectation that this meeting will help to build lasting mentorship and collaborations that will help to advance the career development of the Travel Award recipients."
"9402011","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Peripheral nerve injury is a frequent source of disability and a particular challenge for rehabilitation in the Veteran population. Although techniques for surgical repair have progressed, outcomes remain unpredictable. In the past, connections of the periphery to the brain had been thought to be fixed in adults, but there is a growing recognition of plasticity in brain function associated with removal of peripheral sensory input. For instance, it is known that sensory cortex associated with denervated body regions become reassigned, and disordered cortical function persists after repair of a surgical lesion. However, successful use of the limbs requires not just brain connections to peripheral targets, but also the coordinated participation o numerous activities within the brain, including interaction with other sensory sites as well as motor, visual, and cognitive areas. We therefore hypothesize that disruption of interactive brain activity underlies rehabilitation challenges after nerve injury repair. New noninvasive technology now exists to assess the integrated performance of the brain. Specifically, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can indicate coordinated activation of various brain loci, while resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fMRI) reveals patterns of communication between brain sites in the absence of stimuli. Our preliminary data show substantial disruption of coordinated brain function following experimental nerve injury and repair. We have the long-term goals of defining this phenomenon in temporal and anatomic detail, which would lay the groundwork for developing an imaging biomarker that could guide personalized rehabilitation that targets appropriate specific functions. We have the additional goal of testing whether artificially maintaining afferent sensory neuron activity to the brain during the healing phase after repair may lessen or prevent brain disorganization. In the work proposed in this SPiRE application, we will obtain initial observations to substantiate our hypotheses by defining brain responses to nerve injury/repair with and without supplying replacement afferent activity, in a limited number of animals in a longitudinal fashion, using our novel techniques. Further, we will develop the means to achieve neuronal stimulation for treatment of untethered animals using implantable optogenetic light sources that activate photosensitive channels expressed in sensory neurons after viral gene delivery. We believe that extending the rehabilitation perspective beyond the nerve repair to include brain function may open the door to a new level of refined rehabilitation assessment, planning, and success."
"9415737","The Marshall University Imaging Core will support the imaging activities of five junior investigators and potential pilot investigators as part of the project titled Appalachian Center for Cellular transport in Obesity Related Disorders (ACCORD). The five junior investigators have identified abnormalities in cellular transport related to disease states which are particularly associated with obesity, including cancer, hypertension and skeletal malformations. With the long-range goal of minimizing the health impact of dysregulated transport, or even blocking or reversing processes related to these transport mechanisms, these researchers seek to develop molecular level descriptions, which will lead to an understanding of the transport mechanism and the mechanism by which external factors can affect transport. The Imaging Core will support the long-range goals of these investigators by providing visualization tools and techniques which will enable them to determine the relative numbers and distributions of the specific proteins they have determined are associated with transport anomalies in selected disease states. The principle imaging tool which will be applied for the visualization tasks is a Multiphoton Fluorescence Microscope, which will enable high resolution optical imaging of tagged proteins. The multiphoton capability increases the quality of optical imaging in tissue, and will be used in studies comparing normal and abnormal tissues. This imaging capability will be enhanced, for researchers developing suitable model systems, via the production of custom tagged proteins suitable for use in live cell imaging. Live cell imaging will provide the opportunity to observe changes in protein concentrations and/or distributions within a cell occurring in response to a physiologically relevant cue or resulting from introduction of a pharmacological agent. Techniques enabled by fluorescent protein tagging, including FRET (fluorescence resonant energy transfer) and FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) may be employed to test developing hypotheses of protein transport mechanisms and their anomalies. Additional capabilities, including single molecule fluorescence imaging and atomic force microscopy will be available for addressing evolving project requirements."
"9319934","During infection the adaptive immune response has two primary goals, a short-term goal to eradicate the present infection and a long-term goal to establish immunological memory and protect against re- infection. These two goals are fulfilled by generating a heterogeneous pool of activated T and B cells that contain both short-term effector cells and memory cell precursors that persist long-term to seed a  + pool of memory cells and provide exceptional protection agianst reinfection. Because cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are critical for clearing many types of intracellular infections and tumors, the development of many vaccines (e.g., HIV and plasmodium) are aimed at generating protective memory CD8 T cells. The question of how different types of memory T cells form during infection and vaccination and what genetic pathways and epigenetic changes control this process remains paramount. This past decade represents the dawn of a molecular understanding of memory CD8 T cell development, which largely through the use of well-characterized infection models in mice has discovered critical transcription factors and cytokine signaling pathways involved in this process. This work has delivered unprecedented insight into the genetic pathways that control memory T cell differentiation, but we are still in a discovery phase as only a handful of factors (cytokines and transcription factors (TFs)) have been identified that modulate effector and memory CD8 T cell differentiation in vivo during infection. Moreover, it is unclear how such factors cooperate or combat one another activities or to regulate the epigenetic states that specify effector and memory T cell fates. Elucidating these genetic and epigenetic networks is necessary to understand how the effector and memory T cell differentiation is controlled. It is likely that we will only really start to understand how T cell fates are specified and how the inherent heterogeneity and plasticity observed in T cells is controlled through studying the epigenome of T cells. Thus, the overarching goals of this MERIT extension are to elucidate genetic and epigenetic control of effector and memory CD8 T cell differentiation, plasticity and heterogeneity. This proposal will not only provide new insight on novel genetic regulators of effector and memory T cell development, but it will also reveal how effector T cell plasticity or commitment to terminal fates is regulated at the genomic level.

"9481409","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The stability and plasticity of synapses are both important for cognitive functions. Plasticity is necessary for learning, while stably formed synapses are believed to encode for long term memory. Yet it is unclear how neurons can maintain this delicate balance and achieve both stability and plasticity in synapses just a few microns apart. Clearly, a high level of compartmentalization is required, which makes polarity proteins ideal candidates to function in this capacity, as they serve to separate and maintain distinct membrane domains. Indeed, we previously showed that a class of polarity proteins called Par (partitioning defective) proteins plays a key role in dendritic spine morphogenesis, with Par1, Par3 and Par6 important for this process. Interestingly, our preliminary studies show that most of the spines in mature neurons are dominated by Par3 and Par6, whereas a smaller fraction of spines are dominated by Par1. This distribution pattern resembles that of Par proteins in developing zygotes and epithelial cells, where Par1 and the Par3/6 complex show opposite localization by mutually excluding each other from their respective domains. Furthermore, our previous studies suggest that Par3 and Par6, which form a complex with atypical PKC (aPKC), promote spine stability and maturation, whereas our preliminary results suggest that Par1 promotes spine plasticity. These data raise the exciting possibility that the Par3/6 complex and Par1 regulate the balance between stability and plasticity of spines, with Par3/6-dominant spines being more stable and Par1-dominant spines being more plastic. We plan to test this overarching hypothesis through two aims. In aim1, we will test the hypothesis that Par1 promotes synaptic plasticity and that plasticity is maintained by increasing the dynamics of the PSD scaffold and by excluding the Par3/6 complex. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the Par3/Par6/aPKC complex promotes synaptic stability and that stability is maintained in part by excluding Par1 from the spines. We will utilize advanced molecular imaging techniques, including FRET, FRAP, fluorescent light-inducible proteins (FLIPs) and 2-photon glutamate uncaging. In addition, we will use 2-photon imaging in live mice to directly test our hypothesis in behaving animals. We will combine these imaging approaches with biochemical analysis as well as electrophysiology. This interdisciplinary approach will allow us to gain fundamental insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of synaptic stability and plasticity. Moreover, multiple lines of evidence are pointing to an important role for Par polarity proteins in neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Thus, our studies will provide mechanistic insight into synaptic plasticity and stability and may shed light on several devastating abnormalities that affect the human brain."
"9523255","Krabbe disease (Globoid-cell leukodystrophy, GLD) is an inherited childhood disease caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme, galactosyl-ceramidase (GALC). In the absence of GALC activity a highly cytotoxic lipid, galactosyl-sphingosine (psychosine, Psy) accumulates and preferentially causes the death of oligodendrocytes. Krabbe disease affects the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS) leading to irritability, sensory deterioration, motor defects, seizures, and cognitive deficits beginning at 6 months of age and death occurs by 2-5 years of age. There is currently no effective therapy for Krabbe disease. In addition, all the evidence from years of research in authentic animal models of Krabbe disease shows that no single treatment provides meaningful long-term benefits. However, we recently showed that a combination therapy approach that simultaneously targets the primary pathogenic mechanism (GALC deficiency) and secondary consequences of GALC deficiency (psychosine accumulation, inflammation, etc) dramatically and synergistically increases efficacy. Although Krabbe disease was described over 100 years ago and the murine model has been available for nearly 40 years, we know surprisingly little about the pathogenesis of the disease. This is largely to the confounding effects of cross-correction. We have created a chimeric form of GALC that retains enzyme activity, prevents the accumulation of psychosine and is incapable of cross- correcting surrounding cells. This novel reagent will now enable us to determine both the contribution of cross- correction to various therapeutic strategies and the role of specific cell types in the pathogenesis of Krabbe disease. The goals of this proposal are to 1) determine the efficacy of newly developed substrate reduction therapy drugs alone and in combination, 2) determine the mechanism/s by which certain therapies interact to synergistically increase efficacy, 3) determine the role of specific cell types in the pathogenesis of Krabbe disease, and 4) determine the mechanism/s by which psychosine is generated and potentially uncover a new substrate reduction target. We will accomplish these goals with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: We will determine the therapeutic efficacy of a CGT-specific SRT drug, BMNS202, alone and in  combination with HSCT and AAV-mediated gene therapy. Aim 2: We will determine the role of HSCT in the synergy observed when combined with CNS-directed AAV-  mediated gene therapy in the murine model of Krabbe disease. Aim 3: We will determine the role of specific cell types in the pathogenesis of Krabbe disease. Aim 4: We will determine the role of acid ceramidase in the catabolic production of psychosine and the  pathogenesis of Krabbe disease."
"9415547","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Unbalanced bone remodeling often causes bone loss and leads to osteoporosis. Wnt/?-catenin signaling is essential for commitment and differentiation of bone forming osteoblasts from mesenchymal progenitors. Changes in mechanical loading can also influence bone formation. Osteocytes, former osteoblasts buried in bone matrix, are thought to be the cells that perceive mechanical signals and orchestrate bone remodeling. However, the molecular mechanisms by which osteocytes perceive and transduce mechanical signals are not fully understood. YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif), two related transcriptional co-factors that shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, have emerged as potentially important transcriptional regulators in mechanotransduction. Their activity is dependent on their subcellular localization, which is tightly regulated by different extracellular cues. Cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ promote proteosomal degradation of ?-catenin and thereby inhibit Wnt signaling. Mechanical signals emanating from rigid extracellular matrix or from fluid flow promote YAP and TAZ translocation into nucleus where they stimulate transcription. Our preliminary studies show that deletion of YAP and TAZ from osteoblast progenitors increased osteoblast formation in mice, and this was associated with increased Wnt signaling. In contrast, deletion of YAP and TAZ from differentiated osteoblasts and osteocytes decreased osteoblast number and bone formation. These results suggest that YAP and TAZ perform different functions in mesenchymal progenitors versus mature osteoblasts and osteocytes. Based on this, we hypothesize that the less rigid environment of osteoblast progenitors retains YAP and TAZ in the cytoplasm, promotes ?-catenin degradation, and thereby inhibits osteoblast differentiation. In contrast, the more rigid environment of osteoblasts and osteocytes, together with other mechanical inputs (such as fluid shear), favors nuclear retention of YAP and TAZ and thereby increases osteoblast number. To test this hypothesis, we will determine whether YAP and TAZ in osteoblast progenitors inhibit their differentiation by promoting ?-catenin degradation using genetically modified mice in which YAP will be restricted to the cytoplasm or the nucleus (Aim 1). In addition, we will examine whether YAP and TAZ expression in osteocytes mediates the effects of changes in mechanical loading on osteoblast number using tail suspension and cyclic compression models (Aim 2). Further, we will perform in vitro studies to identify YAP and TAZ target genes in osteoblasts and osteocytes that are responsible for their effects on osteoblast number using genome-wide mRNA expression analysis (RNA-seq) in osteoblastic and osteocytic cells before and after suppression of the endogenous YAP and TAZ genes (Aim 3). Successful completion of these studies will shed light on novel mechanisms that control bone formation and will advance knowledge of how the skeleton responds to changes in mechanical load."
"9493778","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This NIH S10 High-End Instrumentation grant application requests funds to purchase a SIEMENS Next Generation PET/CT scanner. The SIEMENS Next Generation PET/CT scanner which we intend to purchase with this grant will be the only commercially available long-bore 8-ring PET/CT system with SiPM detectors; this scanner will replace our much-used current research PET/CT scanner, a 10-year-old SIEMENS Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner housed in our 8,900 square foot Washington University Center for Clinical Imaging Research (CCIR). Washington University has a long history of expertise in PET imaging. Creating the foundation for expertise in PET, Washington University's research in imaging sciences dates back to physicist and Nobel laureate Arthur Holly Compton's discovery of gamma ray/electron scattering interactions in 1922. This ground-breaking research continued with the installation of a cyclotron in 1938, the first in the world for biomedical applications. In the early 1960s another biomedical cyclotron was used to produce short-lived isotopes of oxygen (15O) and carbon (11C). This dovetailed with the development of the first human/clinical use positron emission tomography (PET) scanner by Michel Ter-Pogossian and team at WU in the mid 1970s. It is especially important for universities performing basic high-impact PET research and first-in-human radiotracer studies, and participating in large-scale single center and multicenter PET/CT trials to have the most advanced PET/CT equipment available. Currently, Washington University (WU), despite 69 PET/CT basic science studies and clinical research trials, multiple first-in-human studies and 4 functional cyclotrons, does not have a research PET/CT system with TOF and optimal count rate performance required for the better image quality and sensitivity needed to detect subtle findings and improve quantitative accuracy in small lesion tracer uptake measurements. The Next Generation PET/CT scanner will be installed in the CCIR, a Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University clinical research NIH recharge facility locate centrally in the main teaching hospital of the Washington University School of Medicine. The CCIR provides a substantive support system for its users, 70% of whom are non-radiologists. The director of this facility, Pamela Woodard, M.D., is the PI of this grant. As Sr. Vice Chair for Radiology Research Facilities, she also oversees other facilities (with their own directors) supportive of this instrument, including the Cyclotron Facility."
"9529981","Tuberculosis (TB) is an ongoing global health problem, causing an estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2014. In spite of growing drug resistance, few new drugs are in the development pipeline. Functions required by pathogen and host for disease to be established and progress would offer a broad range of novel targets. However, our understanding of the relevant functions remains limited, necessarily limiting our ability to target them with new therapies. Upon infection with the bacterium that causes TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), macrophage recognition of bacterial products triggers innate immune programs. One response induced following Mtb-mediated permeabilization of the phagosomal membrane is the type I interferon (IFN) response. ESX-1-mediated protein secretion, required for Mtb growth in macrophages and mice, was previously known to be required for phagosomal permeabilization. In recent work, we have determined that additional Mtb factors required for growth in the host are required to induce the type I IFN response, suggesting that loss of type I IFNs can serve as a surrogate marker for loss of critical bacterial functions. Whether type I IFNs play a causative role in TB pathogenesis or are simply a marker of phagosomal permeabilization is an area of active scientific debate, and small molecules that block this response would be useful tools for definitively answering this question. In the proposed work, we will (1) optimize a high-throughput assay to quantitate macrophage type I IFNs upon Mtb infection (2) apply that assay to a 50,000 compound library to identify small molecule inhibitors of the type I IFN response and (3) use secondary and tertiary assays to prioritize compounds for further study and development as potential anti-TB agents. Our screening assay will couple high-throughput ELISAs with imaging based quantitation of macrophage number to capture both type I IFN quantity and compound-related macrophage toxicity in the initial read-out. To prioritize compounds confirmed by retesting to be true hits, we will apply a series of secondary assays. We will first use in vitro growth assays to determine whether each compound has an effect on Mtb growing in culture alone. To determine which hits restrict Mtb intracellular growth, we will then use a high-content imaging assay to quantitate Mtb growth in compound- treated macrophages. We will then use a genetic tool to determine which hits impair Mtb-mediated phagosomal permeabilization. We will prioritize compounds for further study and development based on potency and toxicity, activity in secondary assays, predicted targets, and structural diversity. At the end of this work we anticipate having a series of small molecules that will serve both as tools to ask and answer critical questions about the role of the type I IFN response in TB infection and as starting points for the development of new anti-TB drugs targeting entirely novel bacterial and host functions."
"9471229","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past decade, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) has worked in collaboration with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) towards the goal of increasing state- based occupational health surveillance capacity. A long-term goal of the CSTE Occupational Health Subcommittee is to build, in collaboration with NIOSH, minimum capacity for the surveillance of work-related injuries and illnesses at the state level. The Western States Occupational Network (WestON) meeting convenes state-based occupational health epidemiologists and scientists from 19 western states, NIOSH and OSHA federal partners, and the NIOSH-funded Education and Research Centers (ERCs) and Agricultural Research Centers located in the western states. The overall goal of this meeting is to strengthen state-based occupational epidemiology in the Western region through capacity building and scientific collaboration, including the ongoing surveillance of work-related injuries and diseases, investigation of cases and outbreaks, and dissemination of information for public health prevention. The WestON meeting aligns with several NIOSH NORA Sector and Cross-Sector Program goals, including Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing (AFF); Mining; Oil and Gas Extraction; Health Hazard Evaluation; and Surveillance. The goals within these Sectors are designed to guide research and research-to-practice through 2016, and are achieved through strong involvement of partners and stakeholders throughout the entire research continuum (conceiving, planning, conducting, translating, disseminating and evaluating research). The WestON meeting has presented topics for discussion and analysis and provided opportunities for collaborations among State-based epidemiologists, academic partners from the ERC/Agricultural Centers, and NIOSH scientists. At its core, the overarching goal of the WestON meeting is to engage a crucial set of NIOSH stakeholders (State occupational health programs) towards the NORA goal of translating and disseminating research findings. As such, CSTE seeks five-year funding to continue the WestON meeting from 2016 through 2020. WestON meetings will continue to be co- sponsored by the Mountain and Plains Education and Research Center (MAP ERC) and the NIOSH Western States Division. CSTE is requesting travel funding for participants who would not otherwise have the opportunity to attend the WestON meeting due to lack of funding within their state. The WestON meeting provides a unique opportunity for this group of professionals to meet and address common workplace safety and health issues and to further develop collaborations and partnerships to enhance state-based epidemiology, surveillance and prevention of work-related injuries and illnesses."
"9537241","Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) continue to be major health burdens, each year causing millions of illnesses and tens of thousands of hospitalizations & deaths in the U.S. Although designed to reduce this burden, influenza vaccine has variable effectiveness (VE) from year to year due to host factors, environment, and virus & vaccine characteristics. Data from the US Flu VE Network helps CDC to evaluate vaccine policy, WHO to select vaccine strains and clinicians to use antivirals.  We propose a test-negative case-control (TNCC) study to determine influenza VE in UPMC, which serves diverse populations in 500 clinical sites. UPMC wins awards as one of the most wired health systems in the U.S. UPMC preferentially uses high-dose vaccine for persons >65 years, routinely records vaccination status in its electronic medical record and has a two-way interface with the state immunization registry.  Our proposal has a strong foundation of current participation in the US Flu VE Network with a multidisciplinary research team with the highest follow-up survey completion rate and enrollment numbers exceeding requirements. Our award-winning, high-throughput lab proposes analyses of influenza, RSV and HMPV. Each virus season definition is supported by >14,000 clinical multiplex respiratory virus tests and ongoing syndromic surveillance. We add agent-based modeling at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center. We are a CDC inpatient VE network site, thus we can compare VE for outpatients and inpatients.  Specific aims include: 1) Using TNCC methods, determine annual influenza and RSV (after licensure) VE against laboratory-confirmed, medically-attended, acute respiratory infections among outpatients in 3 age groups: 6 mos.-18 yrs., 19-49 yrs., and >50 yrs.; 2) Determine the annual, population-based burden of influenza, RSV and hMPV in the same age groups, using the participating primary care sites as the source population, conduct sensitivity analyses and agent-based modeling on the impact of vaccination options; 3) Prepare for studies related to an influenza pandemic, describing the epidemiology, effectiveness of antivirals and/or pandemic vaccines, including pilot studies on patient portal/phone enrollment."
"9527631","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) has the opportunity to expand upon a recent pilot study conducted in conjunction with team members from University of Rochester and their subcontractors at Google[X] and Answer Informatics working with a social media monitoring software (SoMMS) entitled nEmesis. The software nEmesis identifies tweets suggestive of foodborne illness by following a user for up to two weeks after the user posts from a food establishment. The nEmesis software then assigns a score to the food establishment based on the quantity and severity of sick tweets. In the pilot program, researchers are observing whether restaurants with high scores also tended to have worse health inspection outcomes as compared to blind assigned controls.  In the proposed research, SNHD plans to expand the software by incorporating existing foodborne illness data, including foodborne illness complaints and customer's sanitation complaints, into the software and allowing it to influence the score. The score will then be used as a tool to determine when and where a regulatory response is needed such as a routine inspection, or an epidemiological investigation, depending on the severity.  By using this novel technology, SNHD will potentially be able to identify cases of unreported foodborne illness faster and investigate cases and potential outbreaks quickly resulting in the reduced spread of disease in the community. Furthermore, if the intervention of unifying the nEmesis software with other foodborne illness predictors is able to identify foodborne illness outbreaks more quickly, less valuable time will need to be spent in the field investigating foodborne illness concerns.  In the proposed research study, SNHD will evaluate whether the intervention has an effect on foodborne illness in the community by monitoring rates of lab?confirmed salmonellosis and E. coli O157:H7, quantity of foodborne illness reports, and quantity of customer complaints on restaurant sanitation. Secondly, SNHD will evaluate whether the intervention has an effect on time spent investigating verified foodborne illness complaints and verified customer sanitation complaints. This data will be collected over the life of the research and then compared to baseline data and analyzed for differences."
"9415741","Along with one of the highest rates of obesity in the country, hypertension, frequently associated with obesity, is highest in West Virginia, occurring in 41% of adults. Important in the pathogenesis of hypertension is altered handling of salt by the kidney. It appears that tight junctions (TJ) have an important role in our body?s handling of salts. In the kidney, the molecular composition of TJ determines the permeability and ion selectivity of different nephron segments. In particular, the TJ in the proximal tubular segment are quite permeable to Na+ and more ?leaky? than TJ in the distal tubular segment. These differences in permeability are consequences of the specific expression of different claudin isoforms. While proximal tubules express claudin 2, distal nephrons have claudin 4 as their major claudin isoform. Interestingly, changes in claudin expression are noted in renal tubules from salt- sensitive hypertensive animals. Consistently, knockout of claudin 4 causes hypotension. Clearly, properly controlled expression of claudins is essential for the intact animal to express maximal natriuresis, and impairment of this regulatory process contributes to salt-sensitive hypertension. However, little is known about what controls the composition of TJ along the nephron. Preliminary studies have shown that the signaling function of Na/K- ATPase (NKA) is a key to this regulation, and thus a key to paracellular selectivity and permeability in renal epithelial cells. The signaling NKA works through the activation of Src, feed forward amplification of ROS (reactive oxygen species), and downstream regulation of other protein and lipid kinase pathways. We have also learned that NKA and Src are highly expressed, and form a protein complex in renal epithelial cells. Moreover, we have demonstrated a dysregulation of this pathway in animal models of obesity and hypertension. On this scientific premise, we propose to test our central hypothesis that NKA regulates the selective permeability of TJ by altering the expression of claudins through its interaction with Src. We further contend that this NKA-mediated regulation is altered in salt-sensitive hypertension, resulting in changes in TJ structure and function in renal tubules. Therefore, Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that NKA regulates TJ permeability, complexity and ion selectivity through a specific Src-caveolin-claudin pathway in renal epithelial cells. Aim 2 will assess whether NKA differentially regulates the expression and trafficking of claudin isoforms. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate human relevance and assess the potential role of NKA-mediated regulation of TJ in hypertension by studying the differentiated kidney organoids from human iPS cells with NKA point mutation generated through the CRISPR technology, and nephron segments derived from animal models of salt-sensitive hypertension. Once completed, the proposed studies will provide novel molecular insight into NKA-mediated regulation of paracellular transport activity in kidney. The finding may lead to novel therapeutic options for hypertension. Finally, participation in the COBRE will provide the necessary enhanced career and scientific mentoring to become a successful independent scientist."
"9496248","Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the US. Yet, its acute severity is not explained by traditional risk factors. Additionally, while infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis are at very high risk for incident asthma, little is known about the mechanisms linking these two conditions. These major knowledge gaps have hindered efforts to develop bronchiolitis treatment strategies and to prevent asthma in this high risk population. The 35th Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration (MARC-35) study (U01AI087881; Camargo, PI) is an ongoing 17-center cohort study that enrolled 1,016 hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis during 2011- 2014. In this racially-, ethnically-, and geographically-diverse cohort, investigators have collected high-quality biospecimens, including nasopharyngeal airway samples at the index hospitalization. Follow-up data include biannual parent interviews, medical record reviews, and in-person exam at age 6 years, with >90% follow-up to date. The present R01 project would extend this large well-characterized bronchiolitis cohort by profiling the gene expression of both nasopharyngeal airway microbiome (metatranscriptome) and host response (transcriptome) in the setting of bronchiolitis, and by examining their relations to both acute (bronchiolitis severity) and chronic (incident asthma) outcomes. In Aim 1, we will examine the relations among the airway microbiome profiles, host transcriptomic profiles, and acute severity of bronchiolitis. In Aim 2, we will determine the relations among the airway microbiome and host transcriptomic profiles in infants with bronchiolitis, and the risk of developing childhood asthma. Finally, using a systems biology approach, Aim 3 will define bronchiolitis endotypes by integrating clinical, virus, immunology (e.g., IgE), microbiome (composition and function) and host transcriptome data, and determine their associations with both the acute and chronic outcomes. Our pilot data lend compelling support to our hypotheses. The present R01 project will provide a unique opportunity to define the pathobiology of bronchiolitis through examining the functional activity of microbiome and host response in the airway. Furthermore, we will also determine the mechanisms linking bronchiolitis to asthma, by investigating young infants with bronchiolitis (median age, 3 months) ? a natural experiment during a critical period of lung development. The project will provide a strong evidence base for developing targeted interventions for acute bronchiolitis treatment and asthma primary prevention (e.g., through modulation of microbiome and immune responses). The investigators are NIH-funded researchers with international expertise in all relevant fields. The study matches well with the 2013 NIAID Strategic Plan."
"9415739","Obesity and hypertension (HTN) have additive effects in increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death in the developed world. Obese individuals commonly have HTN, and obesity appears to be an important cause of treatment-resistant HTN. Oxidative stress and impaired renal Na excretion are strongly associated with obesity induced HTN. Nevertheless, it is not completely known how oxidative stress affects renal Na handling and blood pressure (BP). We have demonstrated a novel mechanism by which Na/K- ATPase, serving as an amplifier for reactive oxygen species, regulates renal proximal tubular (PT) Na transport and then blood pressure through Na/K-ATPase signaling. Pilot studies have shown that protein carbonylation, a widely accepted marker for oxidative stress, is pervasive in renal PT Na/K-ATPase in hypertensive and obese mice. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that obesity is complicated by chronic oxidant stress within the kidney. This leads to pervasive carbonylation of the proximal tubular Na/K-ATPase ?1 subunit which impairs proximal tubular Na/K-ATPase-Src-ROS signal transduction and ion transporter redistribution. As a result, animals with such chronic oxidant stress have impaired natriuresis in response to increases in dietary Na and become hypertensive. We will test this hypothesis through both in vitro and in vivo studies. In Aim 1, we will investigate the effect of chronic oxidative stress induced by glucose oxidase on Na/K- ATPase-mediated renal PT Na transport. In Aim 2, we will use diet induced C57BL/6 obese mice and polygenic obese TALLYHO/JngJ mice for covering a broader spectrum of human disease mechanisms. We will test the effect of chronic oxidative stress induced by obesity on Na/K-ATPase signaling-mediated renal Na handling and BP as well as effect of the specific Na/K-ATPase signaling antagonist, pNaKtide, on this process. The novel findings of this study may allow for the identification of new targets for interventions in the clinical treatment of obesity related hypertension. Finally, as COBRE junior investigator I will receive scientific and career mentoring while generating important novel preliminary data to apply for NIH R01 funding to become an independent investigator."
"9406105","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the course of accomplishing the previous specific aims, we found that a relatively brief expression of a mitochondrial targeted restriction endonuclease, ubiquitously in mice, generates double strand breaks (DSB) in the mtDNA of the different tissues. MtDNA levels recovered from this transient event and no abnormal phenotypes were observed in the weeks following the molecular insult. However, later in life mice developed a phenotype resembling accelerated aging. Initial characterization showed a reduction in progenitor cell pools. These observations, together with other recent reports led us to hypothesize that progenitor cells are targets of mtDNA damage. We also obtained preliminary data showing that p53-associated pathways are involved in the mechanism leading to a reduction of progenitor cell pools after mtDNA transient insults. We propose a series of experiments to rigorously test this hypothesis in mouse and cultured cells. We will also develop a valuable model of mice with heteroplasmic mtDNA deletions, which will be used to unveil the role of mtDNA deletions in aging. These models will be shared with the research community. We expect that these studies will increase our understanding the role of mtDNA damage in aging."
"9509911","Project Summary  Capsular polysaccharides are essential to the virulence of many organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the major cause of community-acquired pneumonia and an important cause of sepsis, meningitis, and otitis media (middle ear infections). In this bacterium, capsules provide resistance against host- mediated opsonophagocytosis and are important in both infection and nasopharyngeal colonization. Ninety- eight distinct capsular serotypes have been identified, each consisting of unique combinations of sugars and linkages. All but two of the serotypes are synthesized by the Wzy polymerase-dependent mechanism in which repeat units built on the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane are transported to the outer face of the membrane where they are polymerized into polysaccharide. Nearly all capsules in Gram-positive bacteria, and a large percentage capsules in Gram-negative bacteria, are synthesized by this mechanism.  Knowledge of specific factors and mechanisms that could potentially disrupt capsule or its synthesis and thereby abrogate virulence is lacking. In studies of the Wzy pathway in S. pneumoniae, we detected a novel inhibitory activity that reduces capsule levels in multiple serotypes by more than ten-fold. Initial characterization showed the inhibitory component to be a small, heat stable molecule, likely a peptide. The inhibitory activity was present in a complex mixture that is readily available and amenable to biochemical, analytical, and physical analyses. The aims of the proposed project are to: 1) identify the inhibitor, and 2) initiate studies to determine the mechanism by which it affects capsule.  The results of these studies will have particular significance to understanding novel mechanisms affecting capsule synthesis. Importantly, they could lay the groundwork for identifying inhibitors capable of reducing capsule levels during infection, thereby reducing virulence of the organism. Because mechanisms for synthesizing capsule are shared by many bacteria, the results may also have broad impact. Consequently, these and follow-up studies will have a high potential to positively impact point of care of patients infected by capsule-producing bacteria, including those resistant to antibiotics."
"9537243","Summary/Abstract Although influenza vaccination is the best available tool for reducing illnesses and deaths due to influenza, influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary substantially from year to year, depending on the antigenic match between circulating viruses and vaccine strains. To guide the ongoing development of influenza vaccination recommendations, we propose to conduct annual estimates of influenza VE, influenza burden of illness, and cases prevented by vaccination. We will conduct active surveillance for medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza in a predefined cohort. We will identify patients seeking ambulatory care for acute respiratory illness; eligible and consenting patients will be enrolled in the study. We will collect specimens for respiratory virus testing from all participants, which will be tested for influenza (including type, subtype, and lineage) via nucleic acid amplification. We will determine risk factors for influenza, and illness outcomes, through a combination of questionnaires and administrative healthcare databases. We will determine subjects' influenza vaccination history through self-report, validated using an immunization registry. Data will be shared with CDC and other participating sites to provide mid-season and end-of-season VE estimates. We will estimate VE using a test-negative design, comparing the odds of vaccination among subjects who test positive for influenza with the odds among subjects testing negative. We will provide annual estimates stratified by virus type/subtype/lineage and by age group. Because we are identifying patients with influenza from a defined cohort, we will also estimate the incidence of medically attended influenza in our study population, and estimate the number of influenza cases averted by vaccination.  This project will also serve as a resource for studying VE and epidemiology of a novel influenza virus, should an influenza pandemic occur during the study period. We will work with CDC and other sites to prepare and pilot-test protocols for pandemic studies. In addition, this project provides a platform for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) surveillance, which can provide important data on the epidemiology of RSV prior to licensure of RSV vaccines. We will test specimens for RSV and estimate the incidence of medically attended RSV in our study population. Finally, we will use data collected from this study to further explore potential biases and limitations of the test-negative design and to anticipate possible effects of RSV vaccine licensure on influenza VE estimates from test-negative studies.  The proposed research will 1) generate data to guide influenza prevention actions and recommendations; 2) provide baseline data on RSV incidence prior to vaccine licensure; and 3) enhance our understanding of the test-negative study design."
"9470405","Abstract Title: Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Oseteopontin Isoform-Induced Neovascularization  Coronary artery and peripheral arterial disease (CAD and PAD) remain leading causes of mortality in the United States and both result in ischemia downstream of vessel occlusion sites. The body's endogenous response to ischemia is to increase neovascularization to recover blood flow through the formation of a functional collateral vessel network. One of the mechanisms by which collateral vessel formation occurs is through arteriogenesis, which is defined as the enlargement of existing capillaries and arterioles into larger conductance arteries downstream of vessel occlusion sites. Arteriogenesis requires cytokine signaling, macrophage recruitment, matrix remodeling, and Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration. We previously demonstrated that osteopontin (OPN), a secreted, multifunctional, glycol-phospho-protein that can act as a cytokine, is highly upregulated in response to ischemia and is a critical mediator of collateral vessel formation. OPN primarily signals through CD44 and integrin receptors and has been linked to cell survival, proliferation, migration and adhesion, all of which are required for collateral formation. Unlike rodents, humans expresses three OPN isoforms as a result of alternative splicing: OPNa, OPNb, and OPNc. Our preliminary data demonstrate that these human OPN (hOPN) isoforms have divergent effects on functional collateral formation in vivo and cell migration in vitro, despite intact integrin and CD44 receptor binding domains in all 3 isoforms. However, how OPN isoforms differentially promote collateral vessel formation and cell migration and what different OPN isoforms are expressed in human ischemic tissues remain undefined. OPN is subject to extensive post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation and glycosylation, which could have significant implications for its intrinsic biological function. Therefore, we hypothesize that differences in phosphorylation of OPN isoforms may significantly alter OPN isoform receptor binding to CD44 and/or ?v integrins and, thus, contribute to differences in OPN isoform intrinsic biological function in cell migration and neovascularization. This project will determine determine the OPN phosphorylations necessary for OPN isoform-specific receptor binding to promote OPN-induced VSMC migration and collateral formation. Understanding the mechanisms by which human OPN isoforms differentially promote collateral formation and cell migration could ultimately provide mechanic insights into the development of novel therapeutic targets to treat patients with obstructive arterial disease, enhancing blood flow and retain tissue function."
"9582129","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A grand challenge in biomolecular research is to rationally design antibodies that bind to target antigens with high affinity and specificity. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate principles for designing the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibody fragments to mediate recognition of aggregated proteins with conformational and sequence specificity. Our proposal is based on our recent discovery that single-domain antibodies can be designed to recognize A?42 oligomers and fibrils using the same molecular interactions mediating A? aggregation associated with Alzheimer's disease (Perchiacca et al., PNAS, 2012). We find that hydrophobic A? peptides can be grafted into a single CDR loop, and the resulting Grafted AMyloid-Motif AntiBODIES (gammabodies) bind to A? oligomers and fibrils with nanomolar affinity. Based on these discoveries, we posit that additional A? peptides capable of mediating gammabody binding can be predicted based on their relative amyloidogenicity. We also hypothesize that the binding affinity of gammabodies will be maximal at small to intermediate CDR lengths that are sufficiently long to display A? self-recognition peptides but not long enough to disfavor binding due to increased entropy. In addition, we posit that our design approach is not limited to A? and can be extended to other amyloidogenic polypeptides, including IAPP (type 2 diabetes) and ?-synuclein (Parkinson's disease). Finally, we hypothesize that even higher-affinity gammabodies can be designed by grafting multiple amyloidogenic peptides into anti-parallel CDRs that are oriented in the same manner as the corresponding peptides at the growing (templating) ends of fibrils. Therefore, in Aim 1, we propose to determine how the length and sequence of CDR3 impacts the binding affinity and specificity for two A? gammabodies (A?15-24 and A?33-42). Then, in Aim 2, we propose to evaluate our predictions of additional A? peptides that mediate gammabody binding to A? aggregates when grafted into CDR3. Next, in Aim 3, we propose to extend the analysis performed in Aims 1 and 2 to evaluate our predictions of peptide segments from two other amyloid-forming polypeptides (?-synuclein and IAPP) that mediate gammabody binding to their corresponding aggregated conformers when grafted into CDR3. Finally, in Aim 4, we propose to evaluate whether the affinity of the A? and IAPP gammabodies developed in Aims 1-3 can be increased by grafting two different amyloidogenic peptides into anti-parallel CDRs to match the orientation of the corresponding peptides at the growing ends of fibrils. A significant outcome of our studies will be the elucidation of how self-complementary, amyloidogenic peptides can be used to mediate antibody-antigen recognition. We expect that our findings will lead to rules for designing of similar single- and multidomain antibodies with specificity for diverse amyloidogenic proteins, including those linked to human aggregation disorders such as Huntington's and prion diseases."
"9597333","Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives Abstract: Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.  In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:  ? the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,  ? a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and  ? the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.  The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane. CEGS NGRID, NIH P50 MH106933, PI: Isaac Kohane also supported these shared tasks.  This proposal aims to organize a series of workshops, conference proceedings, and journal special issues that will accompany the shared-task challenges in order to disseminate the knowledge generated by the challenges."
"9412778","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients who develop sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) before age 65 (~5% of all AD patients) pose a clinical challenge and a scientific enigma. From a clinical perspective, early-onset (EO) patients often present with primary executive, language or visuospatial symptoms (with relative sparing of memory), and accurate diagnosis is challenging due to overlap with non-AD dementia and non-degenerative conditions. Emerging AD biomarkers could facilitate accurate diagnosis but have rarely been studied in this population. The performance of biomarkers in studies of typical late-onset (LO) AD cannot be generalized to EO patients because of differences in degenerative patterns and reference ranges. From a scientific perspective, EO syndromes show a striking dissociation between amyloid-beta (A?) pathology, which is diffuse and symmetric in all syndromes, and brain degeneration, which parallels symptoms and can be asymmetric or focal. This raises fundamental questions about the mechanisms that drive clinical and anatomic diversity in AD. This proposal applies detailed clinical phenotyping and multi-modal neuroimaging to optimize the diagnosis of EO syndromes, and to study mechanisms of heterogeneity in AD. Leveraging the specialization of the UCSF ADRC in early-onset dementia, the study will include 150 mildly impaired (CDR 0.5-1) EO AD patients, 50 each with a predominant executive/memory, language and visuospatial clinical phenotype, and 40 patients with LO-AD. A positive amyloid (PIB) PET scan will be required for inclusion. Patients will undergo structural MRI, functional connectivity (resting state) MRI (fcMRI), FDG-PET and CSF analysis. Comparative data from matched normal controls (NC) and non-AD dementia patients will be obtained from other ongoing studies. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that neurodegeneration in all AD variants converges in temporoparietal regions that comprise the posterior portion of the default mode network (DMN), a core, selectively vulnerable network in AD. Aim 1 tests the diagnostic applications of this hypothesis by comparing the sensitivity and specificity of temporoparietal versus hippocampal MRI/FDG measures in discriminating EO-AD versus NC and non-AD dementia, and compares the performance of imaging biomarkers in EO vs. LO-AD. Aim 2 applies fcMRI to test the hypothesis that the posterior DMN is affected across EO syndromes and in LO-AD, while the relative involvement of other functional networks drives the clinical phenotype in each AD variant. Aim 3 investigates how functional connectivity in healthy adults relates to the patterns of amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in AD variants, in order to test a model in which A? deposition is driven by nodal stress in cortical hubs, while neurodegeneration originates in syndrome-specific epicenters within the DMN that initiate the trans-neuronal spread of disease and drive the clinical phenotype. These investigations will facilitate the early and accurate diagnosis of EO AD variants, and will further our understanding of the relationships between clinical phenotype, structural and functional brain changes and molecular pathology in AD."
"9413336","Project Summary/Abstract Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a very common, inherited disease affecting the world's population with a frequency of approximately 1:500. No approved treatment to slow or halt disease progression is currently available in the US. The disease progresses slowly to renal failure, typically in the 4-6th decades of life. However, for unknown reasons the rate of progression greatly varies from patient to patient even within the same family suggesting that environmental factors may affect disease progression. Recent results from animal studies suggest that renal insults are required - in addition to the gene mutation - for renal cysts to arise. However, rare forms of renal injury are unlikely to account for the constant pace of disease progression in humans.  Our results suggest that a much more prevalent form of sub-clinical renal insult is the trigger of renal cyst formation that determines the rate of progression in ADPKD: microcrystals that are sporadically lodged in renal tubule lumens. We show that deposition of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals in renal tubules leads to rapid activation of the mTOR and Src/STAT3 signaling pathways, both of which are also strongly activated in ADPKD. In addition, CaOx crystal deposition leads to rapid tubule diameter widening that can be blocked by mTOR inhibition. Our results suggest that tubule dilation is a purposeful, and previously unrecognized, protective mechanism that facilitates crystal excretion. After crystal clearance, tubule diameters return to normal within a week. However, in mice lacking PC1 - the protein affected in ADPKD - CaOx challenge leads to persistent tubule dilation that ?overshoots? to cystic progression. This suggests that PC1 is required to re- establish normal tubule diameters after insults. We hypothesize (1) that tubule dilation is an innate renal protective mechanism against tubular crystals; and (2) that this mechanism inadvertently acts as a trigger for tubule dilation leading to cyst formation in ADPKD. If correct - these ?ndings immediately open a new and highly feasible avenue for therapeutic intervention because well-established treatments for recurring nephrolithiasis (dietary changes, increased water intake, citrate) should also be effective in slowing the progression of ADPKD.  Using mouse and rat models of CaOx nephrolithiasis we will investigate tubule dilation and signaling pathway activation in response to crystal deposition and test whether citrate treatment prevents these effects (Aim 1). Using pharmacological inhibitors and genetic mouse models we will determine if tubule dilation is required for effective crystal clearance (Aim 2). Using conditional knockout mice for the ablation of cilia or PC1, respectively, we will determine if tubular crystal deposition acts as a trigger for cystogenesis (Aim 3). Using a mosaic PC1-KO mouse model and a rat model of PKD we will determine if crystal burden modulates disease severity in PKD."
"9449266","Project Summary Regulatory T (Treg) cells characterized by the expression of the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) play a central role in the control of immune tolerance to self-antigens, allergens, and commensals as well as immune responses to pathogens and tumors. mTORC1 is a master growth regulator that is essential for Treg cell function in vivo, as mice with Treg cell-specific loss of mTORC1 develop rampant autoimmune disease and die at an early age. mTORC1 integrates signals that reflect the availability of growth factors and the nutritional status of an organism. Amino acids is an essential nutrient metabolite that makes up the majority of mammalian cell mass and functions as critical regulator of mTORC1 signaling. Nevertheless, whether amino acid sensing plays a role in Treg cell function remains elusive. To this end, this proposal will study the role of the Rag GTPases dependent amino acid-sensing pathway in Treg cell homeostasis and function. Preliminary studies revealed that constitutive activation of this pathway resulted in deregulated Treg cell homeostasis and precipitated immune activations in mice, most prominently at sites where Treg cells are constantly bathed in fluctuating levels of nutrients, such as the liver and the intestine. It is thus hypothesized that repression of the amino acid-sensing pathway is essential for Treg cells to maintain stable expression of Treg cell characteristic molecules and suppressive function, and the lack of this negative regulation results in overt immune activation. This proposal seeks to characterize how constitutive activation of the amino acid-sensing pathway affect Treg cells by characterizing the proliferation, survival, and suppressive function of Treg cells. Furthermore, this study will investigate if deregulation of the amino acid-sensing pathway bypasses the stringent requirement of strong T cell receptor and IL-2 signaling in proliferating Treg cells, resulting in the generation of defective Treg cells. Finally, this study will investigate if constitutively activated amino acid sensing affects Treg cell functions in chronic viral infection and cancer. Together, this research will shed light on how the sensing of amino acid affects Treg cell homeostasis and function. From a clinical standpoint, altered Treg cell homeostasis can contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases including infections and cancers. Thus, this proposed research may uncover ways to modulate immunity and inflammation for therapeutic benefit."
"9598011","Poverty disproportionately impacts minority and rural populations and is very strongly correlated with poor health over the life cycle, and has been hypothesized to lead to a shorter, less healthy aging process. Poverty is associated with a greater burden of disease than smoking and obesity combined and accounts for the bulk of health disparities by race. It is widely believed that an anti-poverty policy?such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)?could improve healthy aging among working-age low-income adults over the life cycle. It does so by increasing material hardship and psychological stress?two risk factors that are strongly correlated with biological markers of premature aging (e.g., shorter telomeres, higher cholesterol levels, and higher blood pressure.) However, the literature linking poverty to health is largely built on correlational data, which is subject to confounding and reverse causation. The experienced research firm MDRC has secured private and public funding for a groundbreaking multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that examines the causal impacts of quadrupling EITC for working adults without dependent children in Atlanta, GA and New York City, NY called Paycheck Plus (PP). Randomization exposes the treatment group to up to $2000 in PP compared to up to $496 in the control group. However, MDRC is not studying the impacts of PP on health. We propose leveraging MDRC?s existing infrastructure and our long history of collaboration with MDRC to add clinical, survey, and administrative measures to explore whether PP improves the health and survival of adult recipients without dependent children. Timed with launch of the study in Atlanta, we propose in-person health screenings with collection of important biomarkers of chronic disease, such as blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood glucose, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (measures that are conceptually linked to poverty). For both the NYC and Atlanta Cohorts, we propose adding survey data that measures health-related quality of life and depression. Since not everybody randomized to the treatment group will file taxes (a requisite for the treated group to receive PP or the control group to receive traditional EITC), we will analyze our health outcomes using an Intent to Treat (ITT) versus Treatment on the Treated (ToT) analysis. This will produce Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) estimates of the unbiased impact of increased PP on health. In addition, we will collect long-term follow up data on mortality for both treatment sites. We will do so by linking individual identifiers administrative mortality data from the National Death Index. Finally, we will model the health and longevity gains associated with PP relative to traditional EITC. This project is innovative for exploiting a planned and fully funded social science experiment to explore outcome measures that were not originally considered by the policymakers. This project is also innovative for being a RTC of an anti-poverty program that uses administrative and clinical health data at a very low cost. We anticipate that PP will be an efficient approach to promoting healthy aging by lifting adults without dependent children out of poverty."
"9614558","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative treatment for hematologic malignancies and other diseases. Donor-derived T cells are capable of identifying and attacking host tumor cells, producing the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effect that is crucial for the effectiveness of HSCT for cancer patients. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) may develop when donor T cells damage the genetically distinct normal host tissues, and remains a major obstacle for more successful applications of allogeneic HSCT. The goal of this work is to examine a new paradigm regarding Granzyme B (GzmB) function after allogeneic HSCT. This proposal is built on our novel discovery of the counter-intuitive role of GzmB in GVH and GVL responses. Using murine models, we have learned that while GzmB is required for CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to cause GVHD, it unexpectedly diminishes the GVL effect. Remarkably, this dual detrimental role may reveal GzmB as a long-desired target, allowing separation between GVH and GVL responses. Notably, hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were shown to initiate both GVH and GVL responses. However, professional APCs (e.g., CD8a+ dendritic cells) may be more important for GVL than GVH responses. That is, GVL response may require cross-presentation by APCs because tumor cells often escape immunosurveillance via defective antigen presentation, while non-hematopoietic tissue cells may be sufficient to induce GVHD in the absence of professional APCs. In this context, our own preliminary data and the findings of others show that CTLs can use GzmB to kill host professional APCs, which serves as a negative feedback mechanism for the control of CTL expansion in viral infection models. Together, these findings prompt us to hypothesize that GzmB-mediated damage of professional APCs (or specific subsets) may diminish GVL response without affecting GVH response, while GzmB also damages other host tissues thereby causing GVHD. To test this hypothesis, we will use transgenic mice that overexpress or are deficient for Spi6 (the non-redundant GzmB inhibitor) to make chimeras in which either resistance or sensitivity to GzmB is confined to hematopoietic vs. non-hematopoietic tissues. This unique system will allow us to determine the mechanisms by which donor T cells use GzmB to damage hematopoietic APCs and other normal host tissues thereby skewing GVL and GVH responses. In addition, we will perform comprehensive but compartmentalized analyses to examine the clinical relevance of Granzymes A and B activation in various lymphocyte subsets in HSCT patients. In summary, this study delves into novel mechanisms of a fundamental T cell pathway, and aims to construct new intervention strategies that can separate GVHD from the beneficial GVL effect. These new concepts and intervention strategies may have the potential to lead to better survival and improved quality of life for HSCT patients."
"9648213","Project Summary/Abstract This R34 resubmission proposes to develop and examine a mental health service model for families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay that reduces risk for mental health problems, and in turn, enhances readiness for preschool. Infants/toddlers with developmental delay exhibit significantly higher rates of disruptive behaviors, peer problems, impulsivity, and academic failure. Their parents also are at elevated risk for mental health problems and child maltreatment. Families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay are more likely to live in poverty with limited access to services, and most receive government-funded, home- based Early Intervention (EI) services (i.e., Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). We propose to leverage the unique position of Infant-Toddler Developmental Specialists (ITDS), front-line providers of EI services, to support parent-infant/toddler interactions and reduce family risks for mental health problems. Based on a rich empirical literature, we selected Child-Directed Interaction (CDI), the first phase of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, as an evidence-based intervention to increase positive parent-infant/toddler interactions and reduce negative interactions. CDI aligns with the training, role, and function of ITDS, and responds to the needs of referred families. We will collaborate with EI provider agencies toward a service model that emphasizes initial training, ongoing supervision, and quality assurance to facilitate infant/toddler mental health (social, emotional, behavioral competence) and parent mental health (anxiety/depression, parenting stress, caregiver strain). We will examine feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of the proposed model to identify facilitators and barriers to service delivery, and we will examine its promise compared to services as usual (n = 4 agencies, 16 ITDS, 112 families). In light of the extensive needs and depleting resources faced by families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay, the proposed work provides a unique opportunity to enhance the natural role and capacity of a skilled EI workforce to provide high quality services that minimize mental health problems and facilitate healthy child and family trajectories."
"9632352","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The in vivo activities of microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes in the intestine toward endogenous compounds are not well studied and their potential impact on normal intestinal function or disease risk is poorly understood. Many P450 enzymes are expressed in the intestine, where they potentially play important roles in maintaining homeostasis of endogenous compounds and influence the susceptibility to intestinal injury induced by drugs and other xenobiotics. Our broad, long-term objective is to determine the metabolic and biological functions of intestinal P450 enzymes and P450 reductase (CPR, required for activities of all microsomal P450s), particularly concerning their impact on disease risks, including susceptibility to adverse drug responses. Studies of the current funding cycle have provided clear evidence for a major role of intestinal P450 in controlling systemic bioavailability of a number of clinically important oral drugs and ingested xenobiotics, and in drug-induced intestinal toxicity. In preliminary studies on intestinal epithelium (IE)-specific Cpr null (IECN) mice, we discovered a role of intestinal CPR/P450 in modulating sensitivity of the colon toward dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, a widely used animal model of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These findings led to the current proposal, to identify the mechanistic link between intestinal CPR/P450 and inflammatory responses of the colon in an animal model of experimental colitis (Aim 1), and to explore more broadly the capacity of mouse and human intestinal CPR/P450 enzymes in the production or degradation of endogenous compounds in the intestine (Aim 2). In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the hypersensitivity of the colon in IECN mice to DSS-induced colitis is mainly due to a loss of abilit of the IE cells to increase production of corticosterone (CC) in response to DSS-induced inflammation, and that a global decrease in CPR expression, as expected in human individuals with CPR deficiency, and as represented in a Cpr-low mouse model, also leads to decreases in intestinal CPR-dependent CC synthesis, and consequently increased vulnerability to experimental colitis. In Aim 2, we will use a unique metabolomics approach to search for additional endogenous compounds, potentially including novel metabolites, that are produced or degraded by intestinal microsomal CPR/P450, and whose tissue levels are impacted by the loss (or decrease) of IE CPR. We will also characterize the ability of human intestinal microsomes to catalyze the synthesis or degradation of the various identified endogenous compounds; the results are expected to provide valuable information concerning human relevance of the findings from our animal studies."
"9418085","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K24 application proposes a mentorship program in patient-oriented research in multi-level contributors to pediatric asthma health disparities, wih a focus on sleep and immune balance. The K24 Candidate is an Associate Professor (Research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, with a history of funding in behavioral interventions and longitudinal research aimed at improving asthma outcomes in urban children and addressing health disparities in pediatric asthma. Training Plan: The candidate will obtain additional training in asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, including state-of the art methods to assess immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep, and in-lab methods to assess sleep phenomenology through experimental approaches. Research Plan: The research proposed involves an innovative investigation of the effects of experimental sleep disruption on immune balance (Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio-Th1/Th2R; plasma IL-6 -pIL-6), and associated changes in asthma- related lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) and daytime performance in urban children with persistent asthma (8-10 years old). Forty children and their primary caregiver will each participate in a within-subjects protocol, with two experimental sleep conditions: baseline sleep (1 overnight, in-lab polysomnographic (PSG) sleep study), followed by sleep fragmentation (1 overnight, in-lab PSG). Prior to each condition, children will follow a 6-day sleep stabilization schedule at home. We will monitor sleep and lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) daily to confirm eligibility and adherence to sleep criteria, and assess asthma status. We include assessments of immune biomarkers and daytime performance following each condition. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers opportunities for mentorship of postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty with interests in POR. Mentees will be involved in ongoing longitudinal and intervention studies on pediatric asthma disparities, including the proposed research, which will focus on biological-based processes that contribute to asthma and sleep in urban children. A strong emphasis is placed on the recruitment and selection of minority mentees. This overall plan capitalizes on the rich resources and training opportunities available to postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty at Brown Medical School, including several T32 fellowship programs, numerous junior faculty with K awards and small grants, a commitment to diversity in training, seminars in research design, ethics, and statistics, and an established infrastructure for evaluation."
"9391607","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The population of senior Veterans prone to heart failure (HF) is expanding rapidly. Exercise intolerance and dyspnea are common symptoms that detract from independence and quality of life and also predispose to increased mortality and morbidity. Peripheral pathophysiology, particularly involving skeletal muscle (SkMx) and vascular perfusion, likely exacerbates limitations such that HF symptoms and poor outcomes relate to combined effects of central and peripheral mechanisms. While HF therapeutic guidelines emphasize cardiac therapeutic parameters, goals to modify HF SkMx function may provide vital complementary gains.  This proposal focuses on benefits of exercise training for HF and evolves from a pilot analysis we began three years ago. Preliminary data show reduced functional capacity (both aerobic and strength) in older HF patients (mean age 66?10 yrs) compared to age-matched healthy controls. SkMx expression of certain genes controlling ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in muscle correspond to the decreased aerobic and strength indices; lean muscle mass also correlates inversely to reduced strength. We now propose to compare four different exercise regimens (i.e., aerobic, strength, combined aerobic-strength, and inspiratory training) to explore how each modality changes function/symptoms in relation to specific peripheral training effects, i.e., exercise effects on SkMx biology (histology, gene expression), peripheral perfusion, and body composition.  Male and female (N=200) systolic HF patients (LVEF d40%) aged e50 years will be studied. Patients will be randomized into one of four 12-week, three weekly training regimens. A comprehensive battery of functional assessments (aerobic, strength, and integrated performance), symptoms, and physiological indices (SkMx histology, gene expression, and perfusion, body composition, and serological measures of inflammation, cytokines, and adipokines) will be assessed before and after training.  Specific aims are: (1) To assess differences in functional outcomes relative to the different training regimens (aerobic vs. strength vs. aerobic-strength vs. inspiratory). We hypothesize that aerobic-strength will be superior to aerobic or strength alone. We also hypothesize that inspiratory training will match the affects of traditional aerobic-strength as it imparts aerobic and strengthening physiology to the diaphragm. (2) To assess gene expression and SkMx perfusion in relation to the different training regimens. We hypothesize that proteolytic genes (FoxO, Ubiquitin) will be over-expressed in relation to diminished function and that the genes counteracting SkMx proteolysis (IGF-1, PGC-1?) will increase in relation to functional gains. Consistently, we will compare how different training regimens modulate gene expression patterns. We hypothesize that exercise modes that directly stimulate SkMx function (strength and inspiratory) will best decrease proteolytic and in- crease anabolic gene expression patterns, and exercise modes that stimulate central cardiac performance and vascular relaxation (aerobic and inspiratory training) will induce relatively greater changes in SkMx perfusion."
"9289521","Despite important advancements in medical and surgical cancer treatments that prolong survival, veterans with oropharyngeal head and neck cancer (OP HNC) are faced with chronic, intractable dysphagia resulting in persistent drastic alterations in diet, the need for feeding tubes, and increased risk for aspiration pneumonia ? a life threatening infection. We must devote research and clinical efforts to mitigate these devastating impairments because currently our rehabilitative intervention options are severely limited. As such, and in keeping with the VHA?s Blueprint for Excellence Transformative Actions, the need for the development of effective swallowing interventions that show potential for rapid translation to clinical practice is imperative. Respiratory-swallow coordination is an essential element of airway protection during swallowing and facilitates many key aspects of swallowing physiology. This key coordinative event is significantly disrupted in patients who are dysphagic following medical and surgical treatments for OP HNC. [Our preliminary trial tested an innovative swallowing treatment approach developed in our clinical laboratory, respiratory-swallow training (RST), that targets respiratory-swallow coordination directly and resulted in compelling improvements in physiologic swallowing outcomes in veterans suffering from dysphagia that persisted long after traditional behavioral swallowing intervention(s). The goal of this proposed trial is to extend our preliminary study using a rigorous, randomized cross over design and determine the impact and durability of RST on clinical outcomes essential for eating, drinking, health, and quality-of-life in veterans with OP HNC. As such, positive results from the proposed trial have high significance and clinical relevance for veterans? health and well-being.] A total of 88 subjects will be recruited and randomly assigned 1:1 to either RST (intervention arm) or no active treatment (control arm), which is considered standard of care in this patient population. Data obtained will be used to evaluate clinical efficacy and durability. Data obtained from [an additional 11] subjects randomized to RST + home practice (HP) will be used to assess the feasibility of adjuvant HP program and to obtain preliminary data on its added impact on efficacy and response durability. The primary efficacy endpoint is Functional Oral Intake Scale level, and the secondary endpoint will be respiratory-swallow phase patterning. We will also elaborate on the impact of RST by detailing the physiological, airway protective, and morphometric changes that occur. We will use reproducible, reliable, and validated metrics that include the Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile, Penetration-Aspiration Scale, and Computational Analysis of Swallowing Mechanics to distinguish the mechanistic effects of RST. Further, adherence to a novel HP component using self-guided practice will be introduced and tested for feasibility and contribution to the degree and durability of the RST intervention effect. Our overarching goal is to provide two parallel tracks of knowledge generation: 1) provide immediate clinical translation of experimental findings to improve the lives of veterans, and 2) drive model generation on fundamental mechanisms of motor coordination. Basic knowledge will drive clinical application and vice-a- versa. As such, this is an ideal experimental and clinical context that will fuel knowledge generation in this highly significant area of science and clinical practice."
"9628464","Abstract: Corneal surface injuries are painful and expose the eye to infections that can destroy vision. During our previous funding period, we characterized a model for the study of recurrent corneal erosions in mice and showed that subbasal nerves (SBNs) fail to reinnervate the cornea prior to erosion formation. In addition, we showed that we could induce SBN reinnervation by treating debridement wounded corneas with mitomycin C (MMC). The long-term goal of our research is to identify the factors that prevent the corneal epithelium from reforming an intact stable barrier after trauma. One factor is failed reinnervation of the SBNs. Our data lead us to propose two hypotheses. The first (Aim A) is that corneal epithelial basal cells adhere to, protect, organize, and maintain the subbasal nerves (SBNs) that originate from the trigeminal ganglion. The corneal epithelial cells protect individual SBNs by secreting a laminin-rich ECM to insulate them from one another, organize SBNs by enclosing clusters of several SBNs within infoldings of their basal and basolateral cell membranes forming epithelial cell:axon adhesions, and maintain optimal SBN function by removing damaged SBN stubs during homeostasis and after injury by phagocytosis. We will test this hypothesis by conducting experiments to answer the following questions: 1. Do corneal epithelial cells adhere to and provide support to SBNs using adhesion complexes and proteins similar to those used by non-myelinating Schwann cells? 2. Do corneal epithelial cells phagocytose axonal debris during homeostasis and in response to SBN damage? 3. Do corneal epithelial cells respond to SBN denervation by altering expression of genes that regulate axon regeneration in Schwann cells? A second hypothesis (Aim B) proposed is to resolve corneal pathology after trauma or disease, adhesion between corneal epithelial cells, SBNs, and the basement membrane must be restored to levels present prior to development of pathology. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary data showing that MMC reduces corneal epithelial cell migration in vitro and MMP9 expression in vivo. We will test this hypothesis by conducting experiments to answer the following questions: 1. Do corneal epithelial cells at the center of the wounded mouse cornea undergo senescence? 2. Can reinnervation be accelerated by treating crush (trephine only) wounded corneas with MMC? 3. Can erosions be eliminated after they form by treating mouse corneas with MMC? 4. Can MMC improve reinnervation of corneas in mice with dry eye disease? 5. Does a prior injury (conditioning lesion) improve reinnervation after crush or debridement wounds? Comparing reinnervation after different wound types allows us to differentiate between mechanisms that permit reinnervation after crush wounds from those that prevent reinnervation after debridement wounds and will give us insight into how MMC enhances reinnervation."
"9467612","Project Summary/Abstract The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however only a moderate number of the hundreds of genes and genomic regions thought to be involved in ASD have been identified. Advances have come largely from the study of rare genetic variants, especially de novo varia- tion, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), insertion/deletions (indels), copy number variation (CNV), and larger chromosomal imbalances. A portion of the progress for ASD has come through the efforts of the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC), which represents a coordinated effort by more than 40 independent groups to rapidly identify ASD risk genes. Here we propose to continue the work of the ASC, largely by continued pro- duction and analysis of sequence data from ASD subjects and their families. The ASC benefits from substan- tial leveraging of resources, including the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) centered at the Broad Insti- tute (BI) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) of ASC samples, supported by an NHGRI Center Grant to BI, to make this renewal as low cost as possible. We also plan new avenues of research, such as integrating whole genome sequence (WGS) data and building on ideas that have emerged from the study of common variants to understand the interplay of common and rare variants to impact risk. Through this new research we will accel- erate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD genes, thereby facilitating our long-term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD emerge. Our rationale is that the identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated neurodevelopmental disorders can form the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Moreover, such variants have direct implications for patients and their families in terms of etiological diagnosis, genetic counseling and pa- tient care. Our central hypothesis ? formulated based on results over the past decade ? is that rare and com- mon variation contributes additively to risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial risk. The objectives will be accomplished with the following Specific Aims: 1) Produce and/or analyze WES of 30,000 new ASD subjects, parents and other controls, for a total of more than 50,000 samples; 2) Develop and apply approaches to find ?hidden? risk variants, and, 3) Use results from common and rare variant studies to describe the interplay of such variation in ASD risk. This contribution is significant because it represents the first step in research to understand pathogenesis of ASD and to the development of pharmacological strategies for treat- ment of core symptoms of ASD and etiologically related neurodevelopmental disorders. The research pro- posed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical methods for identify- ing risk variants and for integrating rare and common variation. This is a new and substantively different ap- proach to gene discovery in ASD that departs significantly from the status quo and provides the means to achieve these important goals."
"9415544","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) includes the establishment of the Bone Histology and Imaging Core (Core C). The scientific theme of the proposed CMDR is the identification of the molecular causes of diseases and conditions that negatively impact the musculoskeletal system or interact with this system as part of their disease process. The Bone Histology and Imaging Core is consistent with this theme in that it will deliver to the Project Leaders state-of-the-art quantitative tissue and cellular data for the characterization of the structural, tissue, and cellular changes that underlie the pathological mechanisms of the musculoskeletal diseases being studied. The Bone Histology and Imaging Core will therefore be a critical component for the success of the Project Leaders. The Core will consolidate existing equipment on the UAMS campus into a large, modern research space within the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and will hire experienced personnel on the campus, which will be supervised by a Core Leader. The specific aims are: 1) To establish the Bone Histology and Imaging Core; 2) To deliver state-of-the-art musculoskeletal imaging, biomechanical testing, and histology services and introduce new analytical technologies to CMDR Project Leaders and faculty; 3) To provide bone histomorphometry training and support educational activities. The success of the Bone Histology and Imaging Core, in conjunction with the other CMDR cores, will support the development of a critical mass of investigators that will ensure the long-term sustainability and productivity of the Center."
"9416134","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes."
"9447683","Project Summary/abstract Headaches are the most common neurologic condition, affecting more than 90% of the population at some point in their lives. Even though headaches are one of the most common indications for MRI, the optimal MRI protocol for this prevalent condition is unknown. Furthermore, patients and physicians are often worried about brain tumors, but the yield of neuroimaging in those with chronic headaches is 1-3%, which is comparable to a healthy population. In response, multiple guidelines recommend against routine neuroimaging in certain headache populations, but which factors should prompt neuroimaging is not clear. Furthermore, false positives are likely common on headache MRI, yet downstream harms of false positive findings have not been studied. We propose three potential solutions to improve the care of veterans with headaches. In Aim 1, we plan to determine the optimal set of MRI sequences for patients presenting with headaches. Our hypothesis is that FLAIR only MRI studies are non-inferior to conventional MRI for identifying brain lesions in patients with headache. Two neuroradiologists will read each MRI scan obtained in veterans with a headache diagnosis that are receiving an MRI as part of their routine care. Our primary analysis will determine the sensitivity of FLAIR-only MRI compared to conventional MRI for identifying headache-causing lesions. If our hypothesis is correct, fewer sequences may lower the incidence of false positive findings without substantially reducing the yield of true positives. Fewer false positives may also decrease the downstream harms associated with current neuroimaging practices. In Aim 2, we plan to define the incidence of downstream harms after false positive findings, which our preliminary data indicates may be quite high. False positive results will be defined as all abnormal MRI findings in the clinical radiologist's report that did not lead to a change in clinical management as determined by two neurologists with adjudication via consensus committee. Downstream harms of diagnostic imaging will be defined as additional diagnostic testing, procedures and consultations. We will also identify the patient phenotypes that are predictive of headache-causing lesions including headache characteristics, headache classification, and high risk clinical features (?red flags?). Previous small studies from selected populations have attempted to address this question, but we will be able to overcome many of the limitations of prior work. By characterizing the harms and high risk patient phenotypes, we will be able to inform rational clinical neuroimaging decisions to improve the health of veterans. Third, in Aim 3, we will identify the core reasons behind MRI overuse in the headache population but surveying providers and patients using the Theoretical Domains Framework. All three of these approaches will directly lead to future implementation studies. Our project is innovative is many ways. If we are able to determine an optimal protocol that is different than conventional imaging, our project may lead the way in changing the paradigm of current neuroimaging from an anatomical based approach (brain) to a symptoms based approach (headaches). Furthermore, we will also be the first group to comprehensively study the harms associated with current neuroimaging practices while also refining our understanding of high risk patient phenotypes. Understanding both of these factors will allow clinicians to have the necessary evidence of the risks and benefits of neuroimaging in different clinical scenarios."
