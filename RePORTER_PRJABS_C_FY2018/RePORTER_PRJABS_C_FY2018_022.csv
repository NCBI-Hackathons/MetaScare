"9414609","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the IMSD is to increase the numbers and success of underrepresented (UR) scientists (Ph.D. and MD/Ph.D.s) trained by the Graduate School of Baylor College of Medicine. $ 8.1 million in grants (1998-2014) provided educational opportunities to students to enhance UR participation and success in biomedical research careers. Since 1998, 89 UR students have earned PhDs, 12 of them MD/PhDs and 3 MDs after medical school. Currently, 87 of them are employed in science, with two others returning soon. Fifteen alumni have faculty positions at Tier 1 institutions (43% who have finished post-docs or residencies). They have acquired a few grants already, including a K99/00, an Early Independence, a R01, a Robert Wood Johnson, and 5 grants from other sources. Ten Ph.D. students are supported each year (salaries and fringe). UR graduate student education has been enhanced by creating individual development plans for each under-represented Ph.D. student with opportunities for a summer bridge program that sponsors a review of molecular and cellular biology, and a mini-review of genetics and neuroscience. Students have increased time to complete graduate coursework with tutoring support, faculty mentoring, fellowship application training, skills building workshops, including four tiers of writing workshops and scientific conference participation. Activities of the Association for Graduate Student Diversity have been enhanced; a seminar series features local and external minority scientists. The number of UR Ph.D. and MD/Ph.D. students enrolled at Baylor College of Medicine at any one time increased from 20 in 1998 to 38 in August of 2001 to 80 by August of 2007. The retention rate of UR Ph.D. students has risen from approximately 66% pre- IMSD to more than 85%. Since 1998, 89 under-represented minority students have received Ph.D.s and 10 received terminal M.S. degrees. The numbers of UR students receiving local, national and international awards has increased dramatically since 1998, to more than 220 awards, including 55 national fellowships. UR students now win research awards and fellowships at a higher rate than non-UR students (http://www.bcm.edu/diversityprogams). All alumni are progressing in their careers in science or professions where they use their scientific backgrounds."
"9447928","PROJECT SUMMARY  Our understanding of the genetics of schizophrenia is advancing at a rapid pace and an increasing number of  risk-­associated  polymorphisms  and  variants  have  been  discovered.  Because  the  majority  of  these  variants  reside  in  intergenic,  intronic  and  other  non-­coding  sequences,  a  precise  variant  or  target  gene  for  schizophrenia  has  not  been  identified.  Therefore,  a  major  challenge  lies  in  designing  testable  hypotheses  to  elucidate the potential function of disease-­associated non-­coding DNA. Many of the risk variants are thought to  affect  gene  expression  through  alterations  of  regulatory  elements,  including  long-­range  enhancer  sequences  physically interacting with transcription start sites separated along the linear genome of DNA. The aim of this  proposal is to map the regulatory sequences (or open chromatin) in discrete cellular populations (neurons and  glia) derived from two human cortical brain regions in a large cohort of cases with schizophrenia and controls,  followed  by  generation  of  a  high-­resolution  quantitative  trait  loci  (QTL)  map  of  regulatory  sequences.  In  addition,  high  resolution  expression  quantitative  trait  loci  (eQTLs),  mapped  in  the  same  samples  and  brain  regions,  will  be  leveraged  to  identify  schizophrenia  associated  non-­coding  regions  that  are  simultaneously  associated  with  differential  exposure  of  regulatory  regions  (open  chromatin)  and  gene  expression  of  nearby  genes (eQTLs). Long-­range enhancer-­promoter interactions of genes potentially regulated by open chromatin  sequences will be mapped in human postmortem brain tissue using chromosome conformation capture. Using  the  existing  schizophrenia-­related  large-­scale  molecular  data  and  the  high-­impact,  high-­resolution,  complementary datasets generated through the proposed studies, we will develop multiscale network models  causally  linked  to  schizophrenia.  The  action  of  individual  genes  on  molecular  and  cellular  schizophrenia-­ associated  processes  and  the  molecular  networks  identified  in  our  studies  will  be  validated  using  iPS-­cell-­ derived  cultures  of  human  neuronal  cell  systems.  The  multidimensional  approach  presented  here  provides  a  roadmap  to  place  schizophrenia  genetic  risk  variants  in  molecular  contexts  to  help  identify  the  underlying  regulatory and expression mechanisms through which they act.  "
"9397722","1. Objective(s): This proposal aims to profile abnormal glycosylation in prostate tumors of veterans, to determine if engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting abnormally glycosylated proteins will demonstrate efficacy against bone-metastatic prostate cancer, and to evaluate mechanisms to improve T cell trafficking to tumor sites and enhance resistance to immunosuppression. 2. Research Design: De-identified veteran prostate cancers will be assembled into tumor tissue microarrays and profiled for abnormally glycosylated proteins through immunohistochemical and histopathological techniques, evaluated for spatial N-glycosylated epitopes through MALDI-TOF imaging, and characterized for O-glycosylated through cellular O- glycome reporter and amplification. An animal model of bone-metastatic prostate cancer will be developed through engraftment of a human osteoblast scaffold to support the bone-enrichment of implanted prostate cancer cell lines in NOD-SCID IL2R null (NSG) immunodeficient mice.  ? Xenograft animals will be treated with a single intravenous dose of human CAR T cells (n=10 per treatment group) to measure the efficacy and potential treatment limitations of adoptive immunotherapy for bone metastases. Lastly, genetic engineering approaches will be evaluated to improve T cell bone homing and increase resistance to immunosuppression, including ectopic chemokine receptor expression and gene-disruption of immune checkpoint molecules. 3. Findings: Preliminary results demonstrate strong expression of Tn-MUC1 in bone- metastatic prostate cancer. 4. Clinical Relationships: CAR T cells have been explored in the clinic for over 6 years, have demonstrated remarkable success for hematopoietic malignancies, but have lacked sufficient clinical success in solid tumors. Nearly 10,000 veterans are diagnosed with prostate cancer per year and bone-metastatic prostate cancer remains a significant treatment challenge. Successful findings from this study could develop new treatment options for veterans with prostate cancer as well as improve CAR T cell adoptive immunotherapy for solid tumors."
"9170944","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Background and Anticipated Impacts on VA Patient Care: Of the 5.6 million patients treated by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in FY11, 14.6% had a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, the fourth most common health condition treated by the VHA, and the leading cause of disability in the United States.(1,2) Advanced osteoarthritis of the hip and knee is treated with total joint arthroplasty (TJA), roughly 11,000 of which were performed in VHA in fiscal year 2011. The overall risks of complications and death in total joint arthroplasty are relatively low (5% and <1%  respectively), but certain patient characteristics (e.g., diabetes, obesity, smoking, alcohol misuse) have been associated with dramatically higher risks. Currently, orthopedic surgeons in VHA have no systematic and validated way of using a patient's demographic and clinical profile to estimate their personalized risk of complications or death related to TJA. Patients also vary substantially in how much they benefit from this common and expensive procedure. As with the estimation of risks, orthopedic surgeons in VHA have no systematic and validated way to estimate patients' personalized likelihood of improvement. It is impossible to balance risks and benefits unless they can be accurately and reliably quantified, a capability currently unavailable to orthopedic surgeons in VHA.  The development and validation of a risk, benefit, and satisfaction calculator, that draws from both electronic health record and manually entered data, would allow orthopedic surgeons to easily and accurately estimate both the expected risks and benefits of TJA for each candidate. These data could then be used within a shared decision making (SDM) framework for more accurate and reliable patient informed consent, including the identification of modifiable risk factors (e.g., weight, smoking) that should be addressed before these elective procedures, and more effective SDM that maximizes effectiveness, safety, patient preferences, satisfaction, and therefore value. Aim 1: Develop and validate a total joint arthroplasty risk calculator for the VHA population. Using the most recent three years of VHA Corporate Date Warehouse (CDW) and VA Surgical Quality Improvement Project (VASQIP) data including roughly 30,000 total joint arthroplasty cases, we will merge data on outcomes, especially death and major complications, and many known and candidate predictors of outcomes. Aim 2: Develop and validate a total joint arthroplasty benefit calculator for the VHA population. Patients (n = 1200) scheduled to undergo TJA at three high volume VA facilities (Palo Alto, San Francisco, Minneapolis) will be recruited to provide pre-operative symptom, functioning, expectation, and quality of life data and then followed up for reassessment one year later. These data will then be linked with VASQIP and CDW data in order to develop predictive benefit models, especially changes in functioning and pain, based on the pre-operative and other (demographic and clinical) data. Aim 3: Develop and validate a total joint arthroplasty patient satisfaction calculator. Because the predictors of risks and benefits may be different than  the predictors of satisfaction, we will also develop a patient satisfaction model using data from the 1200 patients described in Aim 2. Aim 4: Develop and pilot test the calculator interface and related decision support functionality. Once the models are developed, we will develop and pilot test a CDW-integrated risk and benefit calculator and decision support system that might be used within a SDM framework. The goal will be to visually display where the patient exists in the risk/benefit space, identify possible opportunities to modify risk and benefit factors, and provide  resources and information to facilitate possible prehabilitation."
"9393974","Physical activity (PA) has numerous and profound benefits on health and function, yet there is limited knowledge of the mechanistic signals that underlie these benefits. Such knowledge is critical for optimizing the effective use of PA as a preventive or therapeutic intervention strategy for specific diseases and in specific populations. The overarching goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to address this knowledge gap by characterizing the molecular responses to PA. This will be accomplished through the collection of blood and tissue samples from both humans and animals, which will then be subjected to extensive ?Omics? analyses. By generating a comprehensive map of molecular responses to PA, MoTrPAC will lay the foundation for a new era of biomedical research on Precision Exercise Medicine. The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC) is exceptionally well poised to lead a MoTrPAC Adult Clinical Center and to contribute to all Consortium activities. Our investigators and collaborators have extensive experience with complex clinical PA intervention trials, including tissue sampling, in cohorts spanning the entire adult age spectrum. Our expertise extends across multiple physiological systems, diseases, and health conditions, and includes broad proficiency in physiologic, metabolic, and morphometric phenotyping. The facilities at CU-AMC for MoTrPAC activities are outstanding. The proposed MoTrPAC ? Colorado Clinical Center will accomplish the following Specific Aims (SA): SA1: Contribute to, and lead when appropriate, all MoTrPAC Phase 1 planning activities (Year 1) described in RFA-RM-15-015 through participation on the MoTrPAC Steering Committee and Subcomittees. The local goals for Phase 1 will be to accomplish tasks (e.g., obtain regulatory approvals, train staff) that will enable Phase 2 to start at the beginning of Year 2. SA2: Recruit and enroll 450 adults at CU-AMC (or the number determined during Phase 1), conduct the acute PA tests and PA intervention according to protocols established by the Consortium, and carry out all other MoTrPAC Phase 2 activities (Years 2 to 5). Highly accomplished clinical investigators will lead the seven ?teams? that will be responsible for: recruitment, screening, and retention; physiologic, metabolic, and morphometric phenotyping; biospecimen acquisition; biospecimen processing; acute PA tests; chronic PA interventions; and data management and quality assurance. SA3: As animal and human data become available from the Chemical Analysis Sites and Bioinformatics Center, we will participate in all Phase 3 activities, including data analysis, preparation of manuscripts, and dissemination of results. These activities will be guided by the MoTrPAC Steering Committee and Subcommittees. On the local level, we will host an annual 1-day local symposium on PA, Health, and Fitness to catalyze the interest of investigators at CU-AMC and other nearby academic institutions in MoTrPAC."
"9617563","Project Summary While Streptococcus mutans is often cited as the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, evidence that caries is a polymicrobial and ecological disease continues to mount. A detailed understanding of the spatial relationship and functional interaction between S. mutans and its neighbors within the dental plaque community, as well as their impact on disease etiology is still lacking, and one of the unsolved mysteries in cariology is that, while the levels of S. mutans correlate well with the disease incidences overall, there are numerous cases in which an individual has a significant burden of S. mutans, but an absence of disease. Based upon preliminary data indicating that the microbial profile of the dental plaque of healthy subjects was significantly different from that of individuals with caries, we hypothesize that the bacterial species with direct physical interaction with S. mutans within the dental plaque consortium play a critical role in modulating the physiology and pathogenicity of S. mutans. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out three interconnected aims: Aim 1: Developing a systematic approach to discover and characterize the physically interacting partners of S. mutans in a diverse dental plaque community. Three assays will be developed to determine the dental plaque species with which S. mutans physically interacts and explore the biogeography of these interactions. Aim 2: Analyzing oral microbial samples from human subjects with different caries severity and identifying the physically interacting partner species of S. mutans. Clinical samples from individuals with a high S. mutans burden and either advanced dental caries or no disease will be analyzed by the techniques developed in Aim 1, to identify how the S. mutans interacting partners and their spatial relationship within clinical dental plaque differs between the two clinical groups. Aim 3: Investigating the impact of physically interacting partners on S. mutans physiology and pathogenicity. Transcriptomic and metabolomic studies will be used to monitor the impact of interactions with specific partner species on expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of S. mutans. This study will identify the ecological fingerprints of cariogenic plaque and will greatly increase the understanding of the relationship between S. mutans and its neighbors in the dental plaque community and will also pave the way for the future study of specific S. mutans genes involved in community pathogenicity."

"9449713","Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a major threat to human health. Each year in the United States, approximately 2 million people are infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics resulting in at least 23,000 deaths. The development of novel antibiotics is needed. However, de novo antibiotic development is resource intensive. Given the poor return on investment, major pharmaceutical companies have significantly decreased antibiotic Research and Development efforts. Academic labs generally do not have access to compounds and sufficient data for rationale design. Veterans who undergo surgical procedures for trauma, including head trauma, are vulnerable to multiple surgical infection, sometimes with organisms that are unlikely to ever represent an attractive target for pharmaceutical companies.  Antibiotic development that capitalizes on existing drug designwork conducted by industry, may avoid some of the expensive missteps due to poor pharmacologic properties that can inadvertently arise in the lead selection. Our approach uses structure-based computational modeling to repurpose drugs as antibiotics. Previous work in our lab demonstrated that inhibition of a Listeria kinase, belonging to a family of Penicillin binding And Serine/Threonine kinase Associated (PASTA) proteins, can sensitize the bacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics. Bacterial Serine/Threonine kinases are signal transducers and our work suggests they are a novel drug development target. While PASTA kinases are common in some gram-positive bacteria, we found there is drug selectivity, not only between human and bacterial kinases, but also between bacterial kinases. We are targeting the subset of PASTA kinase containing bacteria with a large back pocket. We have already obtained a crystal structure of our target bacterial kinase (PknB) with a lead compound demonstrating this pocket. This information enables us to specifically modify the lead to both increase potency and maximize selectivity using previously defined structure activity relationships with human kinases. Furthermore, our atomic resolution drug: target structure will guide us on regions of the drug that can be modified to explicitly test Lipinski's rules for drug development and determine if they should be modified for antibiotic drug development. In this proposal, we will build on our existing work with the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1: Design, synthesize, and test both biochemically and microbiologically novel aminofurazan kinase inhibitors that exploit the uniquely shaped back pocket of some of the PknB family of kinases. Aim 2: Test the toxicity of these novel kinase inhibitors, as well as determine the effectiveness of  combined beta lactam antibiotics with kinase inhibition in an animal model (Danio rerio). We will  analyze the effect of our kinase inhibitors on both a panel of human kinases as well as on  embryogenesis and fertility in zebrafish. When this work is complete, we will have generated data on how to design kinase inhibitors that act poorly against human and zebrafish kinases, but are potent against certain bacterial kinases. Pathogens that include kinases with this unique back pocket morphology include diverse skin and soil bacteria that complicate traumatic and surgical infections in the VA such as Clostridia, Nocardia, Propionibacterium acnes, and Mycobacterium. Furthermore, our work will set the stage for early stage trials on treating drug resistant mycobacterial and nocardial infections as well as atypical skin organisms that can complicate surgical infections common in veterans using a novel agent that synergizes with an existing antibiotic class with low toxicity."
"9418076","ABSTRACT - PROJECT 3 Metalloproteins that contain a heme prosthetic group (hemeproteins) are essential to lung functions, including airway host defense and inflammation [inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS)], and bronchomotor tone [soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)]. We recently discovered that NO inhibits heme insertion into apo-proteins by the S-nitrosyation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which functions in heme transport and insertion. Recycling GAPDH is dependent on cellular redox and S-denitrosylase enzymes, i.e. GSNO reductase (GSNOR) or thioredoxin 1 (Trx1). These exciting findings and longstanding interactions with Program members in the study of asthma over the years made it a natural step to investigate whether the high- levels of NO in the asthmatic airway blocks hemeprotein maturation. Our preliminary results show that asthmatic airway epithelium escapes NO-mediated inhibition of heme insertion by upregulation of denitrosylase pathways, enabling the expression of active iNOS, but that airway smooth muscle cells are overwhelmed by NO at the levels produced in the asthmatic airway, with consequent loss of heme-replete sGC. New preliminary data generated in murine models of asthma and in the human precision cut lung slice model suggest that heme-independent sGC-activators are strikingly effective bronchodilators. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that thiol denitrosylase systems enable continuous airway epithelial NO production by iNOS in asthma by restoration of hemeprotein maturation, but that the NO overwhelms smooth muscle denitrosylase systems, compromising maturation & function of the sGC in smooth muscle, which results in bronchoconstriction and airway hyper-reactivity. We plan concurrent mechanistic studies and studies of the bronchodilator response to novel pharmacologic sGC agonists in (i) primary airway smooth muscle cells from healthy and asthmatic airways, (ii) precision cut human lung slice model and (iii) mouse models of asthma using genetically modified mice (including NOS1,2,&3 -/-, GSNOR-/- and smooth muscle specific sGC-/-). Also, we will study hemeprotein maturation in airway epithelial cells freshly obtained from healthy individuals and asthmatics with low or high FENO to help verify clinical relevance and potentially endotype sGC-agonist responders. sGC agonists will be tested in order to translate the discoveries to patient care soon. This research will provide the first information on hemeprotein maturation in healthy and asthmatic airway, and test connections between dysregulation of hemeprotein maturation and the bronchoconstriction and inflammation characteristic of asthma."
"9412876","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vagus nerve is a major conduit between lung and brain required for normal respiration. Within the airways, vagal sensory neurons detect mechanical stretch of the lung during tidal breathing, cues associated with inflammation and illness, and irritants that in some species evoke cough. However, molecular mechanisms by which vagal sensory neurons detect and encode respiratory stimuli remain poorly understood. In preliminary data, we used a molecular and genetic approach to classify sensory afferents in the airways, and adapted genetic tools to map, image, ablate, and functionally control vagal sensory neurons. We genetically tagged two sparse populations of vagal afferents (P2RY1, NPY2R) that exert powerful and opposing effects on breathing (Cell, 2015). P2RY1 neurons are largely fast-conducting a fibers that innervate clusters of pulmonary endocrine cells termed neuroepithelial bodies. Optogenetic stimulation of vagal P2RY1 neurons stops breathing, trapping animals in exhalation, without acutely impacting heart rate or gastric pressure, which are also under vagal control. NPY2R neurons are largely capsaicin-responsive C fibers, and optogenetic activation of vagal NPY2R neurons causes rapid and shallow breathing. Based on these results, we hypothesize that vagal P2RY1 neurons mediate the Hering-Breuer inspiratory reflex, while vagal NPY2R neurons are involved in pulmonary defense. These findings raise basic questions regarding the sensory stimuli in the airways that activate P2RY1 and NPY2R neurons, whether these neurons are required for normal respiration, and how these neurons sense and transduce airway cues. We will use P2ry1-ires-Cre and Npy2r-ires-Cre mice, and genetic approaches for in vivo imaging, neuron ablation, and cell-specific gene knockout to probe the sensory biology of vagal P2RY1 and NPY2R neurons. In Aim 1, we developed a new in vivo imaging paradigm in vagal ganglia that involves a genetically encoded calcium indicator, and will use this technique to query the specific response properties of vagal P2RY1 and NPY2R neurons. In Aim 2, we will selectively eliminate P2RY1 and NPY2R neurons by controlled diphtheria toxin-mediated cell ablation and determine the impact on respiratory physiology. In Aim 3, we will explore the roles of particular cell surface receptors in vagal afferents using knockout mice that lack Piezo2 or P2RY1 in some or all vagal sensory neurons. Piezo2 is abundantly expressed in a cohort of airway- innervating sensory neurons, and is a prime candidate to mediate an aspect of airway mechanosensation. Together, these studies should provide insights into cellular mechanisms underlying activation and modulation of breathing control pathways by peripheral cues. Understanding the sensory biology of respiratory control neurons in the vagus nerve may provide therapeutic targets for airway disease intervention."
"9426353","Project Summary Pediatric cardiomyopathies encompass a heterogeneous group of disorders including dilated, hypertrophic, and less commonly, restrictive cardiomyopathies. Emerging experimental evidence and epidemiologic data suggest that the pediatric heart failure population is distinctly different from adult patients The most common cause of heart failure and reason for cardiac transplantation in children older than 1 year is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCAmong these etiologies, pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has an estimated 40% five year transplant-free survival and remains the most common diagnosis leading to heart transplant in children greater than 1 year of age. The central hypothesis is that circulating microRNAs (miRs) will be useful biomarkers for risk stratification, will correlate with outcomes and may represent novel therapeutic targets in children with DCM. The aims of this study are: 1) Determine the profile of circulating miRs in a cohort of children with DCM and acute systolic heart failure. The circulating miR expression patterns will then be stratified based on reaching a primary end-point by 1 year defined as: [1] death or transplantation, [2] recovery (normalization of ventricular size and function) or [3] stable DCM (persistent ventricular dilation or dysfunction); 2) Define the miR profile in a separate cohort of children with chronic, stable DCM to determine if those patients with stable DCM who progress to death/transplant within 1 year will be similar to the profile of the Aim 1 cohort of children with acute heart failure who also progress to death/transplant; and 3) Analyze the expression of circulating and heart tissue miRs in pediatric controls (non-failing donors whose heart could not be placed [NF]) and pediatric DCM patients. The results of this study could improve clinicians prognostic? assessment at diagnosis of DCM in children, improve decision-making regarding listing children for heart transplant as opposed to identifying those who are expected to recover ventricular function, and could provide insight into cellular mechanisms of disease and define novel targets for future treatment of DCM in children."
"9432545","The role of Lung Surfactant (LS) in lowering the surface tension, ?, at the alveolar air-liquid interface is well known. We hypothesize that a second essential function of LS is to prevent the Laplace instability, which drives gas out of smaller alveoli and into larger ones, leading to alveolar de-recruitment, atelectasis and loss of lung compliance. These are the core symptoms of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which afflicts 150,000 people in the US with a 40% mortality rate. We hypothesize that the dynamic resistance of the LS monolayer to changes in area can reverse the Laplace instability. The dilatational modulus, ? = ? ?? ?? , relates the change in surface tension, ?, to the change in interfacial area, A. For 2??? >0, the Laplace pressure decreases with decreasing radius, suppressing the Laplace Instability. However, if 2??? < 0, variations in lung inflation drive collapse of smaller alveoli, leading to the alveolar flooding and decreased lung compliance.  Our preliminary work shows that serum proteins and lysolipids, which increase in the alveolar fluids during ARDS-induced inflammation, increase ? by competitively adsorbing to the alveolar interface. These inhibitors also dramatically decrease the dilatational modulus due to their diffusional exchange with the subphase, especially at low interfacial area strain rates (?A(t)/A). Such conditions arise in damaged areas of the lung with poor gas exchange and high levels of inflammation products and provoke the Laplace instability as 2??? < 0. This leads to further damage in injured areas of the lung and a negative feedback loop is established that may be responsible for the ineffectiveness of current ARDS treatments.  To address this hypothesis, we have built a novel capillary pressure microtensiometer to measure ?(?) of LS, serum proteins, and lysolipids for the first time. We will map out ?(?) for clinical and model lung surfactants as a function of surfactant composition, morphology, surface pressure and frequency to determine the effects of saturated vs. unsaturated lipid fraction, domain morphology, and lung surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C, cholesterol and fatty acid fractions. We will examine how ?(?) changes due to subphase compositions of lysolipids, albumin, and fibrinogen, all of which have elevated levels in the ARDS lung. These first of their kind measurements should provide us with a map of the conditions under which the Laplace instability plays a role in the progression of ARDS. Reversing the Laplace instability requires understanding how to prevent inhibitors from reaching the alveolar interface, or removing inhibitors that do adsorb. From our new understanding of ?(?) we will create LS formulations with optimized rheological properties to promote LS respreading. We also propose that minimizing the anionic lipid fraction in LS and adding low concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and trivalent cations from adjuvants such as alum, will provide an electrostatic and osmotic assist to promote LS adsorption. Minimizing the inhibitor concentration and maximizing LS would lower ?, increase ?(?) and reverse the conditions leading to the Laplace instability, thereby restoring proper lung function."
"9486294","ABSTRACT Infections caused by MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative pathogens challenge clinicians to find safe and effective antibiotic regimens that can eradicate these opportunistic pathogens from the frail, often immunocompromised hosts that they target. Two features of the P. aeruginosa cell envelope - its limited permeability to small molecules and the large number of both constitutive and inducible efflux systems it contains - render this pathogen intrinsically resistant to many available antimicrobials and contribute to acquired resistance toward the small set of existing anti-Pseudomonal antibiotics. This seriously limits the ability to identify ?hits? with antibiotic activity using whole-cell assays - as compounds that penetrate and can inhibit key metabolic pathways are often effluxed out before they measurably inhibit bacterial growth or viability. Approaches that identify novel small molecule inhibitors of key bacterial enzymes often fail when these small molecules cannot achieve effective intrabacterial concentrations - and our understanding of the chemistries that would allow for penetration and retention is woefully incomplete. In this application we use a diverse array of riboswitches, sensitive and specific RNA-based small molecule sensors, as rapid and quantitative indicators that bacterial physiology has been perturbed. By multiplexing several riboswitches that report on accumulation of the alarmones ZTP and ppGpp, as well as the toxic product of increased SAM utilization, SAH, we can effectively screen for ?signatures? of a bacterial response to sub- MIC levels of small molecules. Our approach places these riboswitch reporters in isogenic MDR and efflux- deficient P. aeruginosa strains, simultaneously yielding information about both physical and structural chemical features that allow penetration and efflux-avoidance and identifying ?hit? molecules that can be developed as leads for new antibacterial agents. Our medicinal chemistry approach will build on both types of knowledge, allowing novel anti-Pseudomonal compounds to be identified and optimized."
"9438478","SUMMARY Once considered a death sentence, infection with HIV is now a manageable, chronic disease. To keep the viral load low and to prevent progression to AIDS, patients are required to adhere to a regime of multiple antivirals for life. Long-term treatment does not eliminate the virus and can lead to serious toxicities. Therapies that either cure infection or that offer improvements in convenience or tolerability are needed. Current anti-HIV therapeutics target fewer than half a dozen protein active sites. Significant recent advances in the structural biology of HIV offer an opportunity to develop therapeutics that target tertiary structures within the HIV RNA genome that are essential to the viral replication cycle. RNA is a compelling target for small-molecule drug discovery, and the genomes of RNA viruses, such as HIV, contain highly conserved targetable structures. Multiple natural products target ribosomal RNA, establishing proof of concept for RNA as a drug target; however, RNA-targeted drug discovery remains a nascent field. Specific tertiary structures in the HIV RNA genome are essential for viral replication, and we are ideally positioned to develop a screening system for small molecules that bind to these tertiary structure elements. The well-characterized Rev response element (RRE) forms a complex with Rev protein that is essential for export of HIV RNAs from the nucleus, a process necessary for productive infection. We will employ the Ribometrix lead discovery platform to identify small molecules with favorable medicinal chemistry properties that bind to the RRE to block binding of Rev or to disrupt the tertiary structure recognized by Rev. These leads will serve as a foundation for development of novel anti-HIV therapeutics. At Ribometrix, our lead discovery platform combines SHAPE-MaP, a high-quality, rigorous biophysical technology for RNA structure analysis, and fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), a well-validated strategy for lead compound identification that allows efficient sampling of chemical space. The strategy we propose to develop here can be used in efforts to identify small molecules that bind to and disrupt structures of diverse therapeutically important RNAs. Thus, we are poised to fully test and establish proof-of-principle for an efficient and generic approach for RNA-targeted ligand discovery, focused on a critical step of the HIV replication cycle."
"9559783","Project Summary/Abstract Agent-based modeling has provided epidemiologists with an advanced tool to estimate critical epidemiologic outcomes among large, diverse populations. The proposed research will build on a well-established model platform, the HIV-Calibrated Dynamic Model (HIV-CDM), to construct a model of the HIV epidemic in Miami, which experiences among the highest rates of new HIV infection in the country. In response to the growing HIV epidemic in Miami, local policymakers, clinicians, and researchers have formed a ?Getting to Zero? Task Force that seeks to eliminate all new HIV infections in the Miami metropolitan area. The campaign is founded on the principle of combination prevention, which enlists the concurrent use of many evidence-based prevention strategies, such as treatment as prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and frequent/targeted HIV testing. Presently it is unknown what effect this campaign will have on incident HIV infections in Miami. This proposal seeks to use agent-based modeling to estimate the long-term impact of the combination prevention program outlined in the Getting to Zero campaign adopted in 2017. Along with estimating specific epidemic outcomes (e.g., HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, time to epidemic elimination), this approach may also assess the relative contribution of each component to the success of the program. Such estimates will be crucial in maximizing the goals of the campaign, as well as assist with the implementation of similar HIV elimination programs. This proposal will: (1) expand the HIV-CDM model, to simulate the demographics and HIV risk behavior of the diverse metropolitan Miami population; (2) estimate the success and limitations of the Getting to Zero campaign using the HIV-CDM model; and (3) perform primary and secondary analyses within subgroups of the Miami population to better understand current research gaps, and those identified in the first two aims. Each component of the research plan will be supported and aligned with specific training components designed to provide the candidate with the necessary professional development and mentorship to execute the research aims, and begin an independent research career. The results obtained from this work may directly impact the assessment of the Miami Getting to Zero campaign and inform all future HIV elimination campaigns in the U.S. and globally. Additionally, the training program will provide exceptional methodological and practical experience leading to an independent and influential scientific career. Supporting this work will be a mentorship team of academic and community leaders in HIV elimination, epidemiology and modeling methodology. This mentorship will build on the methodological and substantive experience I have demonstrated while leading numerous studies on epidemic modeling and HIV epidemiology."
"9393973","ABSTRACT  Exercise is a powerful physiological stimulus contributing to disease prevention and intervention. The protective and preventive effects of exercise are well-documented for metabolic, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. While scientists acknowledge the extensive benefits of exercise, there is still insufficient understanding about the underlying mechanisms by which exercise prevents disease and improves health across diverse organ systems. The NIH Common Fund has developed a forward-looking funding mechanism ? six tethered RFA's tied to creating a research consortium, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) ? to create resources and critical information for exercise and health investigators well into the future. Two products of the MoTrPAC collective efforts will be a publically available data resource that will enhance and accelerate subsequent mechanistic research on diseases and conditions affected by physical activity; and a biorepository of clinical and animal model samples to be used in studying exercise biology. Based on prior collaborative efforts, our group believes that we are ideally positioned to propose a protocol that will respond directly to the RFA, while at the same time execute the large volume of tests to complete the ~450 people required at each site within the MoTrPAC consortium. To accomplish all of our Clinical Center goals, we have developed a consortium ? the North Carolina Clinical Site Consortium (NCCSC). The NCCSC consists of the experienced research teams Duke University School of Medicine; East Carolina University (ECU); and Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM). As described in the study plan, the NCCSC weighed a number of alternatives for training regimens, timing, and type of tissue sampling, sample sizes for the four obligated study groups, and other factors, while staying within budget constraints. The following Aims will maximize the value of the data and sample repositories; this will be accomplished with the enrollment of 540 individuals and finishing 450.  · Aim 1: To determine the response of molecular transducers to a single acute bout of either aerobic or  resistance training.  · Aim 2: To determine the responses of molecular transducers to a chronic exercise training program of  either aerobic or resistance training.  · Aim 3: To determine the responses of molecular transducers to a detraining period following either aerobic  or resistance training."
"9569158","Liver disease is currently the most common cause of non-AIDS morbidity and mortality in developed countries amongst HIV infected people. Indeed, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is more prevalent during HIV infection compared to the uninfected population occurring in 30-40% of HIV-infected individuals. Critically, fatty liver disease is becoming an increasingly recognized precursor to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can further develop into cirrhosis and liver failure. Progression toward NAFLD and steatohepatitis is multifactorial, and includes metabolic changes, cytokine release associated with TLR stimulation and oxidative stress. With regards to HIV infection, the precise drivers and mechanisms of liver disease are not well defined. This proposal will utilize the pathogenic SIV infection of rhesus macaques and in vitro human cell cultures to delineate the early mediators that drive liver disease during SIV/HIV infection. Our previous study assessing livers from SIV-infected and SIV-infected-cART-treated macaques (assessed at necropsy) identified increased levels of bacterial 16s DNA in the livers of both groups. Importantly, an unexpected finding from this study was the enrichment of Mycobacterial 16s DNA in the liver of infected macaques, which we have subsequently identified as Mycobacteria smegmatis, a commensal or potentially opportunistic pathogen. These data, as well as published findings, have led to the hypothesis that translocation of bacteria and bacterial products to the liver (including Mycobacteria-associated dysbiosis) are key mediators of liver inflammation during cART-treated HIV/SIV-infection and can initiate the early events that trigger fatty liver disease. This hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims the first two Aims assess immune and microbiome changes within the liver, lymph node and blood in SIV-infected-cART-treated macaques. Aim 3 will evaluate the mechanisms underlying changes observed in human macrophages or hepatocytes utilizing in vitro experiments following exposure to HIV, cART and bacteria/PAMPs. Our goal is to delineate the role of bacterial translocation and microbiome dysbiosis in HIV/SIV-associated liver inflammation, with particular focus on mycobacteria. To undertake these aims, this study will be led by Dr. Sodora, who has 18 years of experience evaluating immune inflammation during HIV/SIV disease including previous studies assessing liver inflammation during SIV-infection and cART-treatment. In addition, the team consists of Drs. Burwitz, Sacha and Smedley at the Oregon National Primate Research Center who have the necessary expertise to successfully undertake the outlined experiments. Collectively, these approaches will allow us to undertake a mechanistic assessment of the precise contributions of HIV/SIV virus, cART drugs and gut-derived microbes in liver inflammation as well as identify potential synergistic effects of these mediators when combined in a macaque or in vitro. Our long-term goal is to identify an immune therapeutic strategy to reduce incidence and/or severity of liver disease in HIV-infected and cART-treated individuals."
"9607184","Focused on elucidating the mechanisms of evolution at the molecular and population-genetic levels, this project involves an integration of theory development and experimental work performed in a phylogenetic comparative manner. The molecular/cellular level focus is on the rate of error production via DNA replication, mRNA transcription, and protein translation in ~50 bacterial and eukaryotic species. This work seeks to test the drift-barrier hypothesis, which postulates that the level of refinement that natural selection can achieve with any trait is limited by the power of random drift and inversely proportional to the effective population size. Measures of replication-fidelity derive from mutation accumulation in long-term sets of serially bottlenecked replicate lines followed by whole-genome sequencing. Newly developed methods will yield parallel estimates of the much higher rates at which inappropriate ribonucleotides appear in mRNAs and erroneous amino acids are incorporated into proteins, allowing evaluation of whether negative associations exist between error propagation at these two levels.  The population-genetic mechanisms of evolution will be clarified via a project to sequence 5000 genomes from geographically widespread isolates of the model microcrustacean Daphnia pulex, as well as from smaller numbers of key outgroup species. Combined with information on the fine-scaled pattern of recombination, this study will reveal the relative magnitudes of drift, mutation, and recombination in a collection of ~60 populations, a survey far beyond that for any other species. This will enable a test of the hypothesis that variation at the level of gene structure and genomic architecture is directly driven by the local population-genetic environment. The D. pulex system also has unique features for gaining insights into two major unsolved mysteries in evolutionary genetics: the origin and long-term effects of introns in protein-coding genes, and the causes and consequences of the loss of meiotic recombination.  Relevance to human health. Because mutation is the source of all variation upon which natural selection acts, provides the fuel for the emergence of pathogens, and is the ultimate cause of genetic disorders and cancer, our work on replication fidelity has broad significance for diverse human-health issues. Because transcription and translation errors lead to cellular toxicity and protein aggregation, work at these levels also has significant applied implications. Finally, for the first time, the 5000 Genomes Project will reveal how population evolutionary features are defined by the relative power of drift, mutation and recombination, yielding insight into the factors driving the efficiencies and mechanisms by which all species respond to natural selection. Elucidation of the molecular/cellular mechanisms by which meiotic production of haploid eggs requiring fertilization is converted to ameiotic production of diploid eggs is highly desirable as it would open up possibilities of clonal propagation in diverse species."
"9470125","An important goal of human genomic research is the identification and characterization of genetic contributors to neurodevelopmental disease. Recurrent deletions and duplications of specific segments of our genome have emerged as some of the most common mutations identified in patients showing abnormal neurodevelopment. Collectively, these genomic losses and gains explain ~5-10% of autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability. Despite intense interest in these rearrangements and their associated diseases, reciprocal genomic disorders (RGDs), relatively few studies have addressed their functional consequences at the molecular level. This project will leverage genome editing technology to generate a series of cell lines with deletions or duplications of interest against an isogenic background. RNA sequencing will then serve as a platform to investigate global changes in gene expression resulting from each rearrangement over the course of in vitro neuronal differentiation. First, I will establish, differentiate, and characterize cellular models for ten RGDs to describe and compare the transcriptional consequences of deletion and duplication at ten genomic intervals (Aim 1). Second, I will develop a method for parallel genome engineering and apply it to obtain cell lines with altered dosage of smaller segments and single genes within four RGD regions (Aim 2). Third, I will differentiate and characterize cell lines with these smaller rearrangements to identify genetic drivers underlying dysregulation observed in the four corresponding RGDs (Aim 3). This research will provide a detailed assessment and comparison of transcriptional effects of the most common RGD rearrangements. The parallel genome editing strategy will be made freely available to the scientific community, allowing researchers to generate hundreds or thousands of isogenic cell lines differing only by specified mutations of interest. Finally, genetic driver analyses promise to implicate new genes in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disease. Overall, by enhancing our molecular understanding of RGDs, this study will inform efforts to develop effective targeted treatments."
"9644455","Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest public health threats worldwide. The development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens is largely driven by inappropriate antimicrobial use. Current reports state that over 50% of antimicrobial use in hospitals and up to 70% in long-term care facilities is potentially inappropriate. Recognizing the urgency of this national crisis, President Obama issued an executive order in September 2014, mandating the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (AMS) nationally, and specifically noting that ?all VA healthcare settings, including long-term care facilities? will be involved. Unfortunately, this process of developing AMS in VA Community Living Centers has lagged behind those in acute-care facilities and little is known about the degree of antibiotic resistance and the types of stewardship interventions that might work in these facilities. Antimicrobial stewardship promotes the appropriate use of antimicrobials in order to improve patient safety and to decrease adverse events related to inappropriate antimicrobial use. Improving antimicrobial use in acute-care facilities is a critical focus of The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), as evidenced by the recent VHA Directive 1031. This policy charges every Veterans Affairs (VA) acute care facility to develop and implement an antimicrobial stewardship program led by champion physicians and pharmacists. This VHA Directive does not currently require the implentation of antimicrobial stewardship activities within nursing homes. In 2013, the VHA provided care to over 100,000 veterans in nursing homes. This proposal brings together a cadre of VA experts in the fields of long term care quality improvement, infectious diseases, geriatrics, and antibiotic stewardship (MDs, PharmDs, PhD) to directly address this timely area of study. In direct response to an HSRD priority area for research involving long term care, the overall goals of this 4 year mixed methods merit proposal are to determine the scope of antimicrobial resistance among VA CLCs, to compare that information with antimicrobial utilization patterns in CLCs and proximal VAMCs, and to develop effective antimicrobial stewardship strategies tailored for the long term care environment. We hypothesize that resistance patterns and antibiotic use for CLCs will vary significantly and will be different from those observed in proximal acute care facilities. Furthermore, we hypothesize that comprehensive interdisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship programs will have the capacity to reduce selection for drug-resistant pathogens for the CLC, minimize transmission of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among patients, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes provided that they are tailored to the unique barriers that long term care entails. The specific aims of this study are: 1) Measure antimicrobial use and resistance in VA-CLCs nationally through the development of a longitudinal database of antimicrobial use and resistance. This database would allow us to quantify regional and temporal trends, and identify areas of high antimicrobial use and resistance nationally, 2) Develop and implement various well researched antimicrobial stewardship practices and programs at three CLCs, 3) Measure Antimicrobial Stewardship interventions on resistance, antimicrobial use and outcomes data from pilot CLCs."
"9423012","Project Summary The proposed research will develop novel methods to assess mediation and interaction between genetic and environmental exposures and different disease subtypes so as to better tailor treatments and prevention efforts to individuals' characteristics and so as to better understand the mechanisms governing disease. Methods will be developed for settings in which there are multiple disease subtypes and these disease subtypes may have different prognosis for survival and may be more amenable to different types of treatment and preventive efforts. Methodology for assessing the role of interaction in understanding mechanisms will also be developed. This will include elucidating the role of gene-environment interaction in the heritability of disease, understanding mediating pathways from exposure to disease in the presence of interaction, and identifying sufficient cause interaction for diseases or disease subtypes such that an outcome would occur if two (or more) exposures are present, but not if only one or the other were present. The methodology will be applied to understand prognosis, treatment decisions, preventive interventions, and mechanisms for colorectal cancer, and also for the development of skin lesions; the methodology will also be applied to understand the role of gene-environment interaction in the heritability of numerous traits."
"9393172","Background: Precision medicine is an innovative approach that takes into account individual genetic differences to inform personalized decisions that can improve diagnosis, prognosis, risk assessment, treatment and disease prevention. Genetic services, including genetic testing and genetic consultation are fundamental to precision medicine. Genetic services have not yet been systematically adopted in many Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities because of their complexity, the limited genetics knowledge and expertise of clinicians, and organizational barriers to utilization. Nonetheless, the demand for precision medicine within the VA is increasing, and understanding optimal care arrangements for common referral reasons for genetic consultation will be crucial to planning for high-quality and high-value precision medicine for our Veterans.  There is substantial variability in the type of genetic consultation available (e.g., cancer, neuro- or reproductive genetics), the expected role of the genetic consultant (i.e., diagnostic, procedural or care management) and in the care arrangements for these consultations in the VA (i.e., care model, mode of delivery and VA or non-VA care). Having different options for care arrangements for precision medicine can be beneficial, but only if the care arrangements are matched to the needs and preferences of both patients and the referring providers, and result in safe, effective and efficient care coordination. However, currently the variation in care arrangements for precision medicine in the VHA depends on available local resources, such as genetics expertise on-site or available through a telehealth service agreement, rather than care arrangements that are flexible and congruent with patient and provider needs and preferences.  Objectives: The goal of this VA HSR&D IIR proposal is to evaluate care coordination for precision medicine, including the care coordination approaches and activities and their effects according to available care arrangements for common reasons for genetic consultation in the VA. We will conduct the following aims: Aim 1. Describe the precision medicine care coordination approaches and activities at VA facilities according to the care arrangement (i.e., model, mode of delivery, and setting), including: the structures of care that facilitate or hinder referral for genetic consultation, referral reasons, referral volume, expected role of the consultant, and successful completion of genetic consults using data extracted from the Corporate Data Warehouse. Aim 2. Describe the effects of care coordination approaches and activities for patients who have completed a genetic consult according to the care arrangement, including: (a) genetic testing uptake and (b) extent of health care utilization (e.g., uptake of procedures, imaging, treatment) as recommended by the consulting clinician. Aim 3. Characterize the contextual factors (patient, provider, and inner and outer setting) influencing precision medicine care coordination approaches and activities (Aim 1); and their effects for patients who have completed a genetic consult (Aim 2). Aim 4. Develop measures of precision medicine care coordination approaches and activities for common reasons for genetics referral using expert panel methods.  Methods: We will conduct a retrospective, observational study using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We will leverage the VA?s world-class electronic health record to identify records from patients for whom a genetic consultation has been requested. We will extract data from these records using natural language processing and manual chart review (Aims 1 and 2). We will conduct qualitative interviews with key informants (Aim 3), and we will use expert panel methods to develop care coordination measures (Aim 4).  Impact: Synthesis of the project findings will guide decisions at every level of the healthcare system, from the individual clinical encounter for genetic health care services to system-wide policy decisions regarding workforce preparedness, infrastructure needs, as well as optimal care arrangements for precision medicine, with the goal to ensure high-quality and high-value precision medicine for our Veterans."
"9531514","Project Summary  The 7th Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on NOX Family NADPH Oxidases, along with the 4th NOX Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for research trainees, is scheduled for May 27 to June 1, 2018, in Les Diablerets, Switzerland. Previous NOX GRCs were highly successful, attracting an average of 150 scientists from diverse backgrounds. The NOX GRC will feature unpublished cutting-edge work from international experts, including junior faculty. The preceding NOX GRS (May 26-27, 2018) addresses the interests and needs of research trainees, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and includes mentoring sessions.  NOX proteins are major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS), expressed in every tissue and cell type. This enzyme family is implicated in many physiological processes and pathologies, mainly due to its prominent role in ROS signaling. The field is advancing rapidly with exciting new developments, from basic biochemistry to structure elucidation and intra- and intercellular signaling, to a better understanding of NOX isoform-specific biological functions using in vivo models, genetic association of NOX enzymes to human disease, and drug development. The biennial NOX Gordon Conference is firmly established as the premier forum for the presentation and discussion of the latest advances in the field in a highly collegial, collaborative, and informal atmosphere. The 2018 NOX GRC/GRS meeting will branch out by connecting related fields to NOX. It includes innovative approaches and promises to be exciting and paradigm-challenging.  The program for the 2018 NOX GRC was developed around the theme NOX as Center of Redox Communication in Health and Disease. The NOX GRC Chair (Ulla Knaus, University College Dublin, Ireland) and Vice-Chair (Albert Van Der Vliet, University of Vermont, USA), along with the NOX GRS Chair (David Heppner, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, USA), have received extensive input from an International Program Advisory Committee and informal discussions. Overall, this process identified nine state-of-the-art session topics and speakers to showcase the breadth of the field and to widen the horizon. In particular, sessions on related and interconnected ROS sources, on Systems Redox Medicine and network analysis, and on controversial issues in the NOX field have been added to disease-oriented studies or sessions on fundamental biochemical and cell biological research. Sessions include 31% female speakers/discussion leaders and 26% junior faculty. Additional young investigators will be selected for short talks from submitted abstracts, accommodating cutting- edge late-breaking scientific advances (total number of speakers in categories trainee or early career investigator ~50%). We expect exciting, state-of-the-art presentations, along with ample time for vigorous discussion. Poster sessions will allow extended discussion and active involvement of trainees in an always friendly, supportive and informal atmosphere. The linked GRS program features speakers selected from among trainee abstracts, as well as career development components and mentoring by senior scientists."
"9415474","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current dogma suggests that all hematolymphoid lineages are derived from a common ancestor, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). HSCs are believed to be the only cells with long-term self-renewal capacity in the bone marrow (BM), and are generally regarded as the cell of origin for continuous multi-lineage blood production during adult life. Evidence supporting this HSC-centric paradigm has been acquired through decades of work based largely on the use of functional assays involving transplantation. However, it is unclear to what extent functional characteristics of cells assayed under transplantation conditions are shared with cells driving non-transplant native hematopoiesis. Because of a historical lack of tractable systems, the mechanistic nature of non-transplant blood production has remained largely unexplored. To address this limitation, my laboratory has developed a novel experimental system in mice where cells can be uniquely and genetically labeled in situ. Using this system, clonal fate of multiple hematopoietic populations can be tracked over time and across lineages, for the first time, in a native context. Our preliminary findings with this model have revealed surprisingly unique features of unperturbed hematopoiesis. Among other things, our data demonstrate that long-term native hematopoiesis is mainly driven by waves of progenitor recruitment and that HSC contribution during this process is minimal. Thus, we hypothesize that native hematopoiesis is driven by fundamentally different mechanisms as transplantation. In this proposal, we aim to extend our earlier findings and to provide comprehensive insight into the biology of blood production in situ. Specifically, we will test whether HSCs can be recruited into productive hematopoiesis via injury, stress, or infection. We will also test whether progenitor recruitment can exhaust during the aging process. Additionally, we will revisit the existence of classical progenitor populations and lineage relationships using our clonal strategy. Completion of this project would elucidate the basic mechanisms underlying blood production and provide insight into stem cell dynamics during disease processes."
"9650400","Anticipated Impact on Veterans Health Care: Nearly 25% of VA users are diagnosed with diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, end stage renal disease, amputations and a significant cause of hospitalizations for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Mortality rates among veterans with diabetes are twice as high compared to veterans without diabetes. In 2012, diabetes was estimated to cost $176 billion in direct medical and indirect costs. These health and cost implications make the effective management of diabetes a policy priority for healthcare providers and policymakers nationwide. This proposal will move beyond hemoglobin A1c (A1c) control to prevent diabetes complications and assess the role of A1c variability. Project Background: A major focus of diabetes management is glucose control, since persistently elevated A1c levels predict adverse health outcomes including microvascular complications. But lowering A1c to moderately stringent targets (<7%) could increase risks of macrovascular disease or mortality. There are increasing data showing that glucose variability plays a significant role in predicting risk of complications. Longer term variability as reflected in A1c fluctuations over time has been linked to risk of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. We have shown that among Veterans with diabetes, increasing A1c variability over a 3 year period is independently associated with risk of MI, ambulatory care sensitive condition hospitalization, and mortality. We wish to further study this for its potential clinical application by developing and validating a novel clinical measure of A1c variability that is unique to each patient.  Project Objectives: We propose an observational study to (a) construct statistical measures and determine  predictors of A1c variability, (b) develop and validate more intuitive clinical measures of A1c variability (i.e. %  time-in-range), and (c) assess the relationship between these measures of A1c variability and adverse health  outcomes in patients with diabetes. Specific objectives include: Objective 1. Construct statistical measures and determine the predictors of A1c variability. Objective 2. Develop and validate a more intuitive clinical measure of A1c variability defined as A1c time-in- range. We will calculate the percentage of days an individual has an A1c level in the appropriate range, based on clinical parameters and the VA-DoD clinical practice guidelines. Objective 3. Estimate the relationship between A1c variability, % time-in-range, and adverse health outcomes? including micro- and macrovascular complications and mortality. Project Methods: The proposed project is a retrospective observational study of secondary data from patient- level administrative and claims data from VA and Medicare. Utilization and pharmacy files will be used to determine patients diagnosed with diabetes between 2004 and 2015. A three-year baseline period will be used to calculate the individual A1c variability measure of coefficient of variation and a %time in range measure. The %time in range measure will be the percentage of days an individual has an A1c level in the appropriate range based on VA-DoD clinical practice guidelines. Patients will be assigned to the provider that orders the most A1c tests for them during the baseline period and provider A1c variability measures will be calculated. Provider A1c variability will be used as an instrumental variable to predict individual A1c variability, controlling for process quality (Objective 1, 2). Residuals will be captured from the equations estimated in these two objectives for Objective 3 to measure the effect of individual A1c variability on health outcomes. Significant relationships will then be further validated in a VA-Medicaid population."

Today, WHO counts 194 Member States. WHO fulfills its objectives through six core functions, which include the shaping of the research agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and dissemination of valuable knowledge.  WHO's roles and responsibilities in health research have recently been endorsed by the World Health Assembly. WHO utilizes its decentralized structure to implement its research efforts at global, regional and country level. To achieve its objectives related to research, WHO maintains effective collaboration with governmental and other research organizations throughout the world, as evidenced by the network of WHO Collaborating Centers. Covering programs on communicable and non-communicable diseases, endemic, epidemic as well as emerging health threats,  WHO addresses a research portfolio with broad complementarity to the goals of NIH and many of its 27 centers and specialized institutes. Based on a track-record of fruitful collaboration between WHO and NIH, the objective of this application is to support a framework of enhanced collaboration in the area of biomedical research. Working towards shared goals of WHO and NIH, it is intended is to build on the respective strengths of both Organizations. In the field of biomedical research, NIH's more basic research emphasis combines with WHO's application oriented research efforts, and its support to research-related training efforts, the fostering of research-related resources, the dissemination of scientific knowledge and the assessment of health-related research and good practices. To implement the proposed collaborative effort, WHO relies on its very broad program experience, its experience as research sponsor, its ability to convene world-leading experts and manage transparent an independent consultation processes, its decentralized infrastructure comprising six regional offices and 146 country offices, and a continuous programmatic and financial commitment. Within the financial limits of this RFA, WHO proposes to conduct annual expert consultations on the assessment and application of novel and innovative biomedical research findings for the development of priority public health interventions in low and middle income countries. There is very significant room for expansion of collaborative activities in support of both institutions shared goals and objectives."
"9417203","PROJECT SUMMARY-CORE B Core B supports every project within the Program by providing access to state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi tools. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were developed with the support of this program, and ongoing innovations by Core B and Program investigators have helped to make these extremely powerful biological tools. During the past funding period, the Core devised a novel algorithm for predicting shRNA potency, which led to the generation of a 5th version of RNAi libraries corresponding to annotated protein coding genes in humans and mice. Technology has also been developed for using CRISPR-Cas9 screening to expose functionally important protein domains. During the upcoming period of requested support, the Core proposes to aid Program investigators through five general aims. First, the program will continue providing access to state- of-the-art RNAi vectors and CRISPR-Cas9 vectors and procedures for analyzing either single gene knockdowns or for performing pooled RNAi/CRISPR screens. Second, the Core will provide Program investigators with access to the mouse and human version 5 shRNA library and will compile sub-libraries upon request. Third, the Core will construct custom CRISPR-scanning libraries for performing structure-function analysis on genes of interest within each Program. Fourth, the Core will produce custom domain-focused CRISPR libraries to allow for interrogation and discovery cancer drug targets in various contexts. Fifth, the Core will carry on its efforts to improve CRISPR-Cas9 technologies, and make those innovations available to the Program and to the scientific community at large."
"9608829","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders that affects ~ 1 in 2,500 people in the US. The disease is named for the three physicians who first identified it in 1886. CMT, also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) or peroneal muscular atrophy, is made up of a group disorders that affect peripheral nerves. CMT affects both motor and sensory nerves. A typical characteristic includes weakness of the foot and lower leg muscles, which may result in foot drop and a high-stepped gait with frequent tripping or falls. Mutations in the small heat-shock protein 27 (HSPB1) cause axonal CMT or distal hereditary motor neuropathy (distal HMN). Our team has developed and characterized transgenic mice expressing mutant (S135F) HSPB1 in neurons only. These mice show all features of CMT2. Expression of mutant HSPB1 decreased acetylated ?-tubulin levels and induced severe axonal transport deficits. Of great significance, we have now shown that pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-induced ?-tubulin deacetylation using our designed HDAC6I [HDAC6 Inhibitor] Tubastatin A corrected the axonal transport defects induced by HSPB1 mutations and rescued the CMT phenotype of symptomatic mutant HSPB1 mice. Our findings demonstrate the pathogenic role of ?-tubulin deacetylation in mutant HSPB1-induced neuropathies and offer valuable perspectives for HDAC6 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for hereditary axonopathies. In order to extend these high impact findings and to advance the best HDAC6I therapies to the clinic for the treatment of CMT and related neuropathies, we intend to more fully explore the structure activity relationships [SAR] of a family of Tubastatin A analogs, the key HDAC inhibitor used in our studies. The aims of this proposal are as follow: 1. Using the principles of medicinal chemistry and computer modeling methods, design and synthesize improved analogs of Tubastatin A and further optimize these for their in vitro HDAC isoform selectivity and potency. In this aim, in silico ADMET calculations will be performed so that only the most drug-like compounds are prepared for the preliminary in vitro studies. 2. For those compounds showing at least 300-fold selectivity for HDAC6 over the other isoforms and having an IC50 of < 50 nM, optimize these new chemical entities for their ability to enhance tubulin acetylation and mitochondrial movement in cultured neurons from symptomatic mutant HSPB1 mice. 3. For compounds showing the best effects in Aim 2, further characterize these compounds by determining their experimental ADMET parameters in order to ensure appropriate stability, cell permeability, lack of off- target activity, safety, etc. 4. Lastly, tes the best compounds from Aim 3 in the CMT transgenic mouse models, characterizing these as we have done before on their capacity to enhance tubulin acetylation in peripheral nerves and to reverse the symptoms in the mutant HSPB1 mice."

Currently immune therapies targeting the check-point inhibitors such as CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 can enhance the T cell response to tumor an these inhibitors have shown great success and as a result have moved to first line standard of care for most metastatic melanoma patients. Ipilimumab (targeting CTLA-4) combined with nivolumab (targeting PD-1) has yielded a 59% response rate in melanoma patients. Melanoma patients with an increased mutational load, and those with NF1 mutation, respond better to anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 therapy. However, side effects are often extensive, producing severe adverse events in >60% of patients including myocarditis for combined anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 therapy. Clearly, refinements of current treatments are needed to enhance survival of metastatic melanoma patients. Approximately 40% of melanoma tumors have mutation or loss of CDKN2A. One of the genes encoded by CDKN2A, INK4a is important for inhibiting the cell cycle kinases, CDK4/6. This results in loss of restrictions on cell cycle and enhanced proliferation of melanoma tumor cells. We have shown that inhibitors of the cell cycle kinases, CDK4/6, can both slow the growth of some melanoma tumors and also enhance T cell recruitment into the tumors. Moreover, approximately 80% of melanoma patients have activating mutations in the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK pathway (30% with mutation in NRAS and 51% with mutation of BRAF). Another 23% have alterations resulting in activation of the PI3K pathway. Recently rigosertib (RGS), a non-ATP competitive multi-kinase inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit the RAS/RAF/MEK and PI3K signaling pathways which are also crucial for melanoma tumor growth. We propose here to determine the effectiveness of combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with RGS in comparison to anti-PD1 therapy which is standard of care. We hypothesize that RGS, which targets multiple kinases, will be effective for treating RAS mutant melanoma in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors. We also propose that an even greater response will occur when check point inhibitors such as anti- PD1 or with activating antibody to CD137 are added to the RGS and CDK4/6i combined therapy regime. In this research grant we will examine the ability of CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with RGS to inhibit the growth of melanoma in immune competent mouse models of melanoma, including NRAS mutant, BRAF mutant, and B16 melanoma (WT for NRAS and BRAF). We will also examine the effects of CDK4/6 inhibition combined with RGS on the immune response to the tumor and characterize the effectiveness of combining RGS with anti-PD1 or other check point inhibitors, or with addition of anti-CD137 treatment in immune competent mouse models of melanoma. Finally, we will evaluate the effectiveness of combining CDK4/6 inhibitor and RGS with anti-PD1 or anti-CD137 for treatment of melanoma patient derived xenografts using humanized mouse models. This study should lead to new and improved therapeutic options for treating our Veterans with metastatic melanoma."
"9451200","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an often disabling disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects more than 2.5 million people worldwide. Current FDA approved disease modifying therapies for MS are only partially effective, are costly and have side effects. Thus, there is a need for the continued development of new treatment strategies and targets for successful management of MS. The antioxidant lipoic acid (LA) has been shown to reduce disease severity and T lymphocyte migration into the spinal cord in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). A small pilot trial of LA therapy showed reduced brain atrophy in MS patients compared to placebo. However, the mechanisms of action of LA are not fully understood, thus limiting advancement of this agent to large multi-site trials. We have shown that LA stimulates cyclic AMP (cAMP) production in immune cells. cAMP is a small molecule second messenger that has immunosuppressive function. Additionally, LA inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production and T cell activation. LA also exhibits anti-oxidant properties by activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling cascade in response to oxidative stress. The goal of this grant is to determine the biochemical mechanisms by which LA may treat and/or halt progression of MS with the hope that we can translate our in vitro results to the in vivo setting. We hypothesize that LA has protective effects in MS and that these effects may be mediated in part by the cAMP and/or Nrf2 signaling cascades.  To accomplish the goals of this grant, the following objectives are planned: (1) Determine the effects of LA on human cells implicated in the pathogenesis of MS and the mechanisms that mediate these responses; (2) Determine if LA treatment enhances blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity and the mechanisms that mediate these responses; and (3) Determine the in vivo effects of LA in a specialized EAE model that develops cortical lesions. A better understanding of the mechanisms of action of LA will provide knowledge and insights for pursuing and maximizing the use of LA as a new treatment strategy for MS. Mechanistic understanding of LA will provide guidance in issues relating to toxicities, contraindications, and potentially in the diagnosis or treatment of different forms or stages of MS."
"9442831","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The African Ancestry-Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (AA-GPC), will support a large expansion of the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (GPC) (current n=33,000) that expands the collection and genomic analysis of patients suffering with schizophrenia and controls with African ancestry (AA). The GPC is a large clinical cohort of patients with schizophrenia (n=10,000), patients with bipolar disorder (n=5,000), family members (n=3,000), and control participants with no history or family history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (n=15,000) (Pato, 2013). The GPC's successful enrollment of nearly 6,000 AA research participants (3,000 suffering from schizophrenia and 3,000 controls) supports the enrollment capacity of the GPC network in African American communities. Our objective through this project is to increase AA schizophrenia cohorts to 22,000 research participants (11,000 AA patients suffering from schizophrenia and 11,000 AA controls), and to draw upon the genomes of these individuals to increase our understanding of genetic influences on schizophrenia. More specifically: 1) We will create an overall GPC cohort for the field of 18,525 AA participants - 8,817 suffering from  schizophrenia and 9,708 controls - by enrolling an additional 5,817 patients and 6,708 control  participants. Existing NIMH AA samples (2,183 cases and 1,292 controls) will be added to the extent allowed under existing consents and availability of bio-samples. In total, the maximum number of AA samples to be genomically characterized is 22,000. 2) We will study genome variation in this large African-ancestry schizophrenia cohort - using a strategic combination of exome sequencing, custom array analysis, and whole genome sequencing - to both broaden and deepen our understanding of genetic variation that influences risk of schizophrenia. As with our current efforts in this area, NIMH investment will be amplified by a contribution  of philanthropic funds from the Broad Institute's Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research."
"9393979","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT A considerable body of evidence shows that exercise training induces multiple beneficial changes in cardiometabolic risk factors and that physically active individuals have lower mortality and morbidity rates than their sedentary counterparts. However, there are marked inter-individual differences in the responsiveness to regular physical activity with some individuals showing great benefits while others do not. While the response heterogeneity is clearly genetically determined, little is known about the molecular pathways and mechanisms that contribute to the adaptation to acute exercise and exercise training. The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to ?understand the molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity?. We therefore propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which we will collect biological samples (blood, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue) before and after a 12-week aerobic or resistance training program in healthy, sedentary individuals. In addition, we will collect samples before, during and after a single bout of exercise at baseline and after training. We will also collect biosamples in highly trained athletes involved in endurance or strength sports. The overarching goal of the program is to contribute to the development of a molecular map of transducers that underlie the effects of physical activity. To achieve this goal, investigators at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center propose to: 1) Enroll and randomize 518 healthy, but sedentary volunteers (50% Caucasians, 47.5% African Americans, 2.5% others; aged 21-75 y; BMI 20-40 kg/m2) in a 3/3/1 scheme to a 12-week intervention trial comprised of two exercise groups, aerobic (AER) and resistance (RES) training, and a control group (CON). The goal is to have 178 completers in each training group and 60 in the CON group (20% attrition). 2) Recruit and enroll 50 athletes (ATH) competing in endurance (n=25) and strength (n=25) sports to serve as an active control group. The ATH group will undergo baseline testing and an acute bout of exercise consistent with their normal training regimen with similar pre- and post-acute exercise samples collection. The AER program will start at 3 days per week of treadmill walking/running progressing to 4 days per week by week 2 with an initial moderate intensity (heart rate associated with 50% VO2peak), then increasing to a more vigorous intensity (HR 75% VO2peak) by week 6. The RES program will be performed 3 days per week and consist of 9 exercises on Universal Gym Equipment, including four upper body lifts, three lower body lifts, abdominal crunch, and back extensions. The RES program will progress from 2 sets of 10-20 repetitions to 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions after week 2. All AER and RES exercise sessions will be conducted under strict supervision by trained staff. Because of the expertise in training studies and translational research as well as the availability of state-of-the-art facilities, Pennington investigators are well positioned to recruit/retain a diverse population, conduct the proposed trial and collect/store the necessary biosamples."
"9546131","Project Abstract This is an application for renewal of a grant to study picornavirus genome replication. Studies of poliovirus (PV) continue to establish paradigms for the molecular and cellular biology of all positive-strand RNA viruses capable of causing morbidity and/or mortality in humans. PV replicates its genome in association with membranes. In fact, the virus creates its own genome-replication organelle (RO) with a unique lipid composition, including an abundance of the phosphoinositide (PIP), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P). During the past five years, many laboratories have been in search of the mechanism by which PI4P biosynthesis is induced by various picornaviruses, including PV. In general, these studies tested the hypothesis that a single viral protein hijacks a single cellular PI4 kinase (PI4K), leading to kinase relocalization and synthesis of PI4P. Because of the long-established connection between the enteroviral 3A(B) protein and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GBF1, most of the early studies focused on 3A(B) and concluded that this viral protein is responsible for hijacking a PI4K, often by an indirect mechanism. However, this once-held consensus opinion has now returned to uncertainty. Many years ago, our laboratory obtained genetic evidence of a possible role of 3CD in the biogenesis of PV RO. During the previous funding period, we made a definitive connection between 3CD and RO biogenesis by showing that 3CD is both necessary and sufficient for induction of PI4P biosynthesis in cells. We demonstrated that the normal cellular GBF1-Arf1-PI4K axis is employed. We identified two derivatives of 3CD with amino acid substitutions in the 3C domain (3CmD) or 3D domain (3CDm) that are defective for induction of PI4P biosynthesis at discrete steps in this pathway. In both instances, the derivatives exhibit perturbations to PIP-binding activity of 3CD. In addition to PI4P, 3CD also induces PI(4,5)P2 (PIP2) biosynthesis in cells. PIP2 induction does not arise from the 3CD-dependent increase in PI4P but appears to be a distinct process based on the observation that both 3CmD and 3CDm proteins remain competent for PIP2 induction. PV 3CD is a PIP-binding protein and a regulator of multiple PIP biosynthetic pathways. Our proposed studies aim to address how and why. During the next funding period, we will pursue the following specific aims: (1) Define the structure-function relationships of the PIP-binding domains of 3C and 3D alone and in the context of 3CD; (2) Elucidate the mechanism of induction of PI4P biosynthesis by 3CD alone and in the context of infection; and (3) Elucidate the mechanism of induction of PIP2 biosynthesis by 3CD alone and in the context of infection."
"9540591","Project Summary Reversible epigenetic modifications on DNA and proteins play essential roles in controlling gene expression. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that RNA also contains reversible modifications and that they play essential roles in processes including fertility, development, and leukemia. Notably, modifications on RNA hold critical functions in the viral life cycle, affecting viruses such as Zika virus, HIV-1, and Hepatitis C virus. 2?-O-Methyl (2?OMe) is an abundant post-transcriptional RNA modification in eukaryotic and viral RNA, and recent studies showed that its presence on the 5? cap of viral RNA protects viruses from detection by the host immune response. We have identified that 2?OMe is also present on non-terminal nucleotides located internally in viral RNAs. However, the roles and locations of these internal 2?OMe marks remain undefined. Understanding how these 2?OMe marks affect viral infection may allow us to manipulate 2?OMe to suppress infection. To understand the roles of internal 2?OMe marks, we recently developed Nm-seq, a novel high-throughput sequencing technique that profiles 2?OMe at single-nucleotide precision with high sensitivity. This proposal aims to use Nm-seq and a combination of virological, molecular biological, biochemical, and genetic approaches to identify biological roles of internal 2?OMe in viral infection. Based on studies in other systems, we hypothesize that internal 2?OMe affects viral infection by impacting viral RNA replication, translation efficiency, interactions with host immune sensors, and infectious virus production. We will first use Nm-seq to determine the locations of internal 2?OMe modifications in two model viruses: Zika virus and Murine norovirus. We will then determine the functions of 2?OMe in the viral life cycle using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase replication assays of 2?OMe-modified or unmodified viral RNA; in vitro translation assays of 2?OMe-modified or unmodified viral RNA; RNA affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry to identify host proteins that bind preferentially to 2?OMe- modified or unmodified RNA; and viral infection experiments in cells depleted of a 2?OMe methyltransferase to measure infectious virus production. Our results will be the first to elucidate mechanisms by which internal 2?OMe affects viral infection, laying the groundwork for studies of therapeutic avenues to treat viral infection by targeting 2?OMe marks and the processes they affect. Our findings will also serve as a foundation for future investigations of 2?OMe in viral and eukaryotic RNA."
"9419167","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomaterial-associated infections account for over one million nosocomial infections per year, and their prevention is a critical component to successful regenerative medicine strategies. Bacterial infection of biomaterial implants frequently results in complete removal of the implant despite aggressive antibiotic therapy. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most clinically relevant gram positive and gram negative pathogens associated with medical device failure. Bacteriophages are bacteria-specific viruses that have the ability to infect and lyse host bacteria. We have recently engineered a poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogel system for controlled delivery of therapeutic proteins that facilitates bone repair in a murine radial segmental defect model. Contamination of these hydrogels with bacteria leads to complete inhibition of bone healing, persistence of bacteria, and bone resorption. The objective of this project is to engineer PEG- based hydrogels that are infection resistant. The central hypothesis is that delivery of bacteriophage using a PEG-hydrogel will reduce infection in a mouse model for bone repair. Aim 1: Engineer hydrogels for controlled delivery of active bacteriophage to eliminate bacteria. Aim 2: Examine the ability of phage presenting hydrogels to reduce infection and improve bone repair. Aim 3: Characterize the in vivo inflammatory response to bacteriophage containing hydrogels. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on developing biomaterials that resistant infection without the use of antibiotics, thereby reducing the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria while minimizing implanted device failure. As outcomes of this research, we will establish the feasibility of controlled bacteriophage release hydrogels to reduce infection and promote bone repair. This research will establish a strategy for infection-resistant biomaterials that is applicable to various biomedical devices."
"9397271","Background: Of the two approaches to performing cardiac catheterization, cardiologists in the VA and US overwhelmingly choose the approach that is known to be less comfortable and more dangerous to patients and more costly to the health care system. The trans-radial approach (TRA), which is accessed via the wrist, is more comfortable for patients; is much safer with half the rate of bleeding complications; and has lower overall costs per episode of care than the trans-femoral approach (TFA), which is accessed via the groin. Yet, today in the US TRA is used in only 25%-30% of cardiac catheterizations, and in the VA is used for just over 40% of catheterizations. The reasons are that TFA predominates in the fellowships where cardiologists train to perform catherizations; certain aspects of TRA, such as the anatomy of the radial artery, make it initially more challenging than TFA; and there is a lack of training resources that address the needs for hands-on training, feedback from an expert, and training of the team. This challenge is common to many medical and surgical specialties where new, superior procedures emerge regularly. We previously developed and piloted a coaching intervention to help cath labs become ?TRA-dominant.? The coaching intervention was team-based, included hands-on instruction with multiple opportunities for corrective feedback, and included a period of support and accountability beyond a training session. The pilot test garnered positive reports from participating teams; however, we do not know if it successfully increases use of TRA. Nor do we know if the coaching intervention works the way we believe it does, through creating a non-punitive atmosphere where participants develop self- efficacy with TRA, overcome the steep learning curve and become proficient. Finally, we do not know the budget impact of the coaching intervention, and whether the costs may be offset by the savings from reduced complications and associated costs. Objectives: Our objective is to improve the VA?s ability to systematically implement new technically challenging, evidence-based clinical procedures. We have 3 aims. Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of a successfully-piloted, team-based coaching intervention in increasing implementation of radial-artery access cardiac catheterization. Aim 2: Adapt, test and refine a conceptual model of team-based coaching for implementation of new procedures based on the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework. Aim 3: Perform a cost analysis of the coaching intervention and effects on costs per episode of care. Methods: We will use a stepped wedge design (i.e., graduated participation) to maximize validity and permit formative evaluation of the coaching intervention to improve it in real time. The primary outcome will be change in number of TRAs as a function of all catheterizations. Secondary outcomes will include improvements in complications, and cost per catheterization. We will conduct qualitative interviews and structured surveys at baseline, again just after the coaching intervention and a third time at 6 months follow-up to adapt, test and refine a conceptual model of team-based implementation that can inform modifying the coaching intervention to other clinical procedures and settings by understanding how the coaching intervention affects factors such as different types of perceived evidence related to TRA, contextual factors related to psychological safety, and team self-efficacy and outcome expectancy. Aim 3 will include two components: 1) estimate the costs of the organizational efforts needed to implement the coaching intervention, and 2) assess the effect of the coaching intervention aimed to increase adoption of TRA on healthcare costs. This will help establish the business case for the coaching intervention cost. Trial data suggests TRA leads to substantial cost savings. By developing a VA business case for the coaching intervention, we will help foster support for dissemination of the proctoring intervention."
"9418067","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):  Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States, affecting approximately one in 12 people. Over the previous award period, research by our Projects and Cores identified mucosal mechanisms underlying airway inflammation and remodeling of asthma. Our overarching goal in this renewal of the Program is to uncover the fundamental mechanisms by which airway epithelial cells acquire pro-inflammatory functions and airway smooth muscle cells take on a hypercontractile and remodeling phenotype so that we can apply the discoveries to develop more effective and targeted therapies for asthma patients. We hypothesize that the mucosal epithelial-smooth muscle coupled unit initiates and perpetuates airway inflammation, hyper-reactivity and remodeling. To test this hypothesis, our team of scientists has strategized innovative and mechanistic Projects that are supported by powerful Cores that use cutting-edge technology to study primary airway cells, organotypic cultures, precision cut lung slices, murine genetic models and clinical study of asthma patients. Project 1 is a continuation and investigates how the activation of arginine metabolism, through arginase and nitric oxide (NO) synthases, regulates airway epithelial cell metabolism and epithelial cell cytokine and mucus production. Project 2 is a continuation and proposes to identify the mechanisms by which [[airway epithelium and smooth muscle interactions]] lead to a pathologic hyaluronan matrix in asthma. Developed as a collaborative new project, Project 3 investigates the mechanisms by which NO controls hemeprotein maturation important to airway epithelial function and smooth muscle reactivity, e.g. soluble guanylate cyclase, and [[explores pharmacologic soluble guanylate cyclase activators as a new pathway for bronchodilation.]] Project 4 is a new project made possible by Program-supported collaborations and investigates the resensitization of ß-adrenergic receptors in the asthmatic airway through kinase pathways that are regulated by nitrosylation. Asthma phenotyping and clinical samples are made available by Core B. Technically challenging and specialized assays for NO and primary cell cultures are supported by a new Core C. Models of asthma using genetically modified mice are provided by Core D. Our investigators have well-established productive collaborations and capitalize on Program synergies and interactions that assure the Program success. The focus of our integrated multidisciplinary team at every step of the Program is to apply discoveries for the better and safer care of asthmatic patients in the very near future."
"9531029","Project Summary Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 cause millions of chronic infections. These viruses cause epithelial oral ?cold? sores and genital lesions, which recur lifelong due to reactivation from a latent viral reservoir in neurons. Clinical outcomes from HSV-1 infection are highly diverse, ranging from surface lesions with quite different rates of recurrence, to asymptomatic shedding, to severe and potentially lethal encephalitis. This variation is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including viral genetic differences, human genetic predisposition, and environmental variables. Animal models serve as the cornerstone of our molecular understanding of HSV-1 disease in vivo, and provide an opportunity to dissect viral genetic contributions to pathogenesis, while controlling for host genetic factors and environmental variables. We have recently sequenced a collection of low-passage clinical isolates of HSV-1 and categorized each isolate according to its reproducible virulence phenotype in a mouse ocular model of infection. We measured virulence in this model by the virus' ability to infect, replicate, and induce lethal disease, which involved the virus initiating infection at the ocular surface, migrating to the peripheral nervous system (trigeminal ganglia), and even penetrating into the central nervous system (CNS). Using multiple statistical approaches, we found two loci in the viral tegument protein VP22 (UL49) that predictably distinguish high-virulence clinical isolates from low-virulence isolates. VP22 is a viral tegument protein that is conserved among alpha-herpesviruses, which functions as a hub of viral and cellular protein interactions. VP22 functions in close concert with the viral transactivator protein VP16 (UL48), and the viral RNAse VHS (UL41). The variant loci detected in association with murine virulence exist at a frequency of approximately 50% in the clinical HSV-1 isolates we have surveyed to date, suggesting that knowledge gleaned from these experiments will provide data on viral variants of relevance to ongoing trials for antivirals and vaccines. With increased power from additional genotype-phenotype data, we will use a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to measure the association of VP22 and other candidate loci with virulence in HSV-1. We will make recombinant HSV-1 strains to test the role(s) of VP22 and other candidate virulence loci both in vivo and in vitro. We will test the hypothesis that virulent and non-virulent phenotypes in vivo result from distinct biochemical differences in VP22 between these isolates. Data from these experiments will enable us to test the robustness of our forward genetic predictions of virulence loci in HSV-1. If these data can be linked to human impacts in the future, the ability to gauge likely virulence level based on viral genotype would provide a powerful tool for future diagnostics and prediction of clinical outcomes."
"9417200","PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT 4 Emerging evidence has implicated transcriptional coactivators and enhancer elements as having a central role in the pathogenesis of human cancer. The research outlined in Project 4 will develop transcriptional coactivators as proteins that support the aberrant capabilities of cancer cells, thus revealing a novel class of epigenetic drug targets in oncology. This research will explore the role of SWI/SNF and TFIID coactivator complexes in the pathogenesis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and will identify novel roles for coactivators in supporting the progression of late-stage Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA). The first Aim of this proposal will analyze the anti-leukemia effects of chemical inhibitors of the bromodomain of BRD9, which are novel compounds we generated in collaboration with Boehringer-Ingelheim. The major objective of this research will be to develop drug combinations that augment the therapeutic effects of BRD9 inhibition in AML. This will include use of CRISPR-scanning and domain-focused CRISPR screening, which are recently developed genetic tools to allow deep mechanistic investigation of endogenous protein complexes and to reveal opportunities for drug repurposing. This research has a direct potential to motivate clinical studies of novel drug combinations in AML patient populations. The second Aim will develop the TAF12/TFIID complex as a novel dependency in AML and reveal its underlying mechanism in supporting oncogene-mediated leukemic transformation. This will also include identifying suitable routes for direct chemical inhibition of this complex, an objective that has yet to be achieved in the cancer epigenetics field, largely owing to our incomplete understanding about how TFIID supports cancer pathogenesis. The third Aim of Project 4 will be to understand how modulation of nucleosome structure by writers, readers, and erasers of post-translational histone marks might endow PDA cells with the capacity to undergo metastasis. This will include domain- focused CRISPR screening to interrogate chromatin regulators that allow distal metastasis in mouse models of PDA. Since early metastasis is a major contributor to the high mortality of PDA patients, this research may significantly impact our basic understanding of the lethal form of this disease, and carries the potential for revealing epigenetic drug targets for this malignancy. Importantly, the research outlined in Project 4 will provide a deep mechanistic investigation of transcriptional mechanisms that support AML and PDA, which will rely on extensive use of epigenomic tools (e.g. ChIP-seq-based measurement of enhancer activity), and biochemical approaches. Project 4 will also feature extensive collaborations with the other Projects and Cores to evaluate molecular mechanisms and in vivo biology of malignant cells. This basic research will reveal novel vulnerabilities in lethal malignancies, which could provide new routes for therapy."
"9449499","Genomic adaptability of the tumor cells is the major obstacle in achieving successful cancer treatment. We have studied both tumor cells and their microenvironment in multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy. The immune microenvironment in MM exhibit considerable dysfunction1. In our previous work, we showed that dysfunctional regulatory T helper cells (Tregs)2, iNKT cells3, and elevated Th17 cells and IL-17A, increase MM cell growth and survival and suppress immune responses and induce bone disease4,5. Also, by targeting IL-17A in myeloma using a human anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody (AIN457) we showed significant inhibition of MM cell growth5. However, the vast genomic changes in MM cells provide them the ability to survive and adapt to the therapeutic and immune micro-environmental influences. Our recent study has defined the mutational spectrum in MM at the time of initial diagnosis and found heterogeneity across patients6. We have recently identified biologically distinct mutations (APOBEC signature) responsible for tumor evolution and heterogeneity6. This clonal evolution is driven by a combination of factors, leads to both clonal selection and formation of new clones. We hypothesize that a combination of micro-environmental influences along with evolving genomic changes drives the tumor clone leading to progressive disease. In this regards, having studied immune status and function in previous funding period, we will now focus on identifying and validating mechanisms driving clonal changes in myeloma along with evaluation of the impact of immune microenvironment on these mechanisms. Towards this goal, we will pursue following specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify molecular markers of progression in MM by investigating mutational signatures, expression profile and APOBEC activity in paired diagnosis and relapse samples We hypothesize that continued acquisition of mutational changes, driven by specific mutational processes, underlies progression of disease in myeloma from newly-diagnosed disease to relapsed state. We will analyze genome sequencing data from archived paired MM cell samples collected at the time of diagnosis and then at relapse following initial therapy, for overall mutational spectrum, types of mutational signatures inducing mutations at diagnosis and then driving the evolution, as well as overall clonal dynamics to identify patterns associated with progression. Based on our preliminary data, we will also evaluate if APOBEC activity and expression in these samples correlates with specific genomic signatures, overall genomic instability and/or progression. Specific Aim 2: To functionally evaluate the role of APOBECs in driving genomic instability in MM. We hypothesize that dysregulated APOBEC activity may be in part responsible for acquisition of new mutational changes associated with progression in myeloma. We will therefore perform loss- and gain-of-function studies using MM cell lines to investigate immediate and long term effects on genomic integrity, ongoing genomic instability, mutational changes/signatures, genes and genomic regions affected and activation/inactivation of genome maintenance, cell cycle and apoptosis pathways, proliferation rate and ability of cells to migrate. Specific Aim 3: To investigate the impact of immune components of the BM on APOBEC activity and genomic stability in myeloma. We hypothesize, that abnormal immune components including B cell subsets and soluble factors may affect APOBEC activity and drive clonal evolution. We will evaluate the impact of B cell subsets, mature and immature DCs, Th17 cells and soluble factors including IFN-? and ?, IL-17A and IL-6 on APOBEC expression and activity, and evaluate changes in genome using our standard assays."
"9283780","Project Background/Rationale: Antimicrobial stewardship as a means to combat the spread of antibiotic- resistant bacteria has become a national priority, both within and outside the VHA. This IIR project focuses on improving Veteran safety by reducing inappropriate use of antimicrobials for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), a very common condition that leads to antimicrobial overuse in acute and long-term care. We conducted a successful intervention to decrease guideline-discordant ordering of urine cultures and antibiotics for ASB. This single site intervention, entitled ?Kicking Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI): the No Knee- Jerk Antibiotics Campaign,? reduced unnecessary screening for ASB by 71% and unnecessary treatment of ASB by 75% in a large and complex VA medical center. The UTI medication use evaluation recently conducted by the VA Antimicrobial Stewardship Task Force (ASTF) shows an acute need for our intervention, as 57% of 1,219 urine cultures treated as UTI (with antibiotics) were actually ASB. Our work is innovative in that we address the cognitive biases that drive overuse of antibiotics and encourage more deliberate choice. Project Objectives: The objective of this project is to facilitate implementation of a scalable version of the Kicking CAUTI campaign across four geographically diverse VA facilities while assessing what aspects of an antimicrobial stewardship intervention are essential to success and sustainability. Our project team and our operational partners will provide expertise and external facilitation, while intervention implementation at the facility level will be performed by the local personnel tasked with antimicrobial stewardship. The two main intervention tools are (1) an evidence-based algorithm that distills the guidelines into a streamlined clinical pathway, and (2) case-based audit and feedback to train clinicians to use the algorithm. The intervention is directed at providers in acute and long-term care, and the goal is to reduce inappropriate screening for and treatment of ASB in all patients and residents, not just those with urinary catheters. Aim 1 is to determine barriers to guideline-recommended practices for management of catheter-associated bacteriuria at intervention sites and assemble the local implementation teams. Aim 2 is to implement and evaluate a scalable version of the Kicking CAUTI intervention in four VA facilities, using four additional sites as contemporaneous controls. 2a: We will measure the clinical outcomes of urine cultures ordered, antibiotic use, and episodes of Clostridium difficile infection using Corporate Data Warehouse and review of selected charts at each site. 2b: We will study the relationship between the dose of the intervention delivered and clinical outcomes. Aim 3: Assess the economic implications of the intervention through a budget impact analysis. Methods: Our intervention will include an on-ramp period for each facility consisting of centrally-led phone calls with local site champions and baseline surveys. Case-based audit and feedback will begin at a given site after the on-ramp period and continue for twelve months. We will stagger intervention roll-out by quarter for each of the four intervention sites. The three-year project timeframe allows 3 months for project start-up, 3 months on-ramp at each site, 12 months for the active intervention implementation, and a sustainability phase at each site. Our analysis for Aim 2A will use clinical outcome data from Corporate Data Warehouse to conduct interrupted time series with segmented regression analysis. The analysis for Aim 2B will use regression models to assess whether more complete implementation is associated with better clinical outcomes, using process measures of key implementation components. The budget impact analysis will assess savings and costs of the intervention from the VHA perspective. Throughout the project we will have two calls each year with our operational partners. These partners, the National Center for Patient Safety, the National Infectious Diseases Service, the ASTF, and Pharmacy Benefits Management, have advised and directed the design of this proposal over the past year and will continue their involvement from the time of project launch to help plan for national dissemination."

DESCRIPTION:  Micellar nanoparticles that mimic the size and shape of viral particles are attractive as a DNA delivery vehicle because of their improved colloidal stability and transport properties, ability to evade immune clearance, and high payload packaging capacity. Moreover, nanoparticle shape has explicitly been identified as an important factor determining their transport properties and delivery efficiency. However, there is no available nanoparticle synthesis method for packaging plasmid DNA payloads while allowing sufficient control over particle size and shape. Recently, we have shown that distinct shape control and tuning for DNA micelles can be achieved through complexation of plasmid DNA with engineered block or graft copolymers of polycation and poly (ethylene glycol) under controlled assembly conditions. In this proposed study, we will develop a synergistic research program comprising parallel and integrated experimental and computational strategies to (1) develop and understand new methods for DNA micelle assembly that permit scalable, high-uniformity synthesis with shape control and high stability; (2) reveal shape-dependent nanoparticle diffusion and transport properties in physiologically media in vitro and in vivo; and (3) demonstrate the delivery efficiency of a theranostic vector by shape-controlled DNA micelles and their imaging and therapeutic efficacy using mouse models of human metastatic cancers. The proposed study brings together a unique combination of expertise in DNA nanoparticle assembly, microfluidics-based single-particle analysis/fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, in vivo imaging, cancer theranostics, and computer simulations to address a crucial knowledge gap in the engineering and delivery of DNA nano-therapeutics. It will not only offer a new, generalizable method for synthesizing shape-controlled DNA micelles, but also provide a mechanistic understanding of shape- dependent transport properties of nanoparticles. Moreover, the integrated nature of our experimental and computational approach establishes a new paradigm that will greatly accelerate the discovery and development of new DNA nanoparticle systems for efficient gene medicine delivery."
"9393976","Project Summary/Abstract:  This application is for the formation of an Adult Clinical Center in response to RFA-RM-15-015 ?Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Clinical Centers (U01)? (MoTrPAC).  Physical activity is an important lifestyle behavior that has been shown to be associated with morbidity and mortality from numerous chronic diseases. This has led to current public health recommendations of 150 min/wk of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 min/wk of vigorous physical activity to achieve significant health- related benefits, and for recommendations to engage in resistance exercise. Despite the abundance of data to support physical activity as a key lifestyle factor that can prevent, delay, or reverse the onset of a variety of health-related conditions, the specific underlying physiological mechanisms and pathways by which this occurs are not fully established.  Our team of investigators is well-positioned to be an Adult Clinical Center and achieve the goals and objectives outlined in this RFA. We have the capacity in Pittsburgh to recruit, retain, train, and assess the 450 participants that are required at each Adult Clinical Center. We will recruit 450 participants at the Pittsburgh Adult Clinical Center, which will include untrained subjects who will be randomized to the intervention (72% of the sample, N=324) or control condition (12% of the sample, N=54) and trained subjects (16% of the sample, N=72).  Untrained participants will be randomized to one of the following for a period of 12 weeks: 1) Control (UN- CON) that will maintain their current level of physical activity; 2) Moderate-Intensity Physical Activity (UN-MOD) that will progress to 150 min/wk of supervised moderate-intensity endurance physical activity; 3) Vigorous- Intensity Physical Activity (UN-VIG) that will progress to 75 min/wk of supervised vigorous-intensity endurance physical activity; 4) Resistance Training (UN-RES) that will engage in supervised resistance exercise. In addition, exercise trained participants (50% endurance trained, 50% resistance trained) will be recruited and will undergo baseline testing only.  Thus, we propose to form an Adult Clinical Center at the University of Pittsburgh to achieve the following objectives of MoTrPAC: 1. To recruit, retain, and collect data on 450 participants (378 untrained and 72 trained) at the Pittsburgh site  that will contribute to the 2,700 total participants across the Adult Clinical Centers. 2. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our training program, we will compare changes in cardiorespiratory  fitness in untrained participants randomized to 12-weeks of moderate-intensity endurance exercise training  (UN-MOD), vigorous-intensity endurance exercise training (UN-VIG), resistance training (UN-RES) or control (UN-CON). 3. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our training program, we will compare changes in musculoskeletal  fitness in untrained participants randomized to 12-weeks of UN-MOD, UN-VIG, UN-RES, or UN-CON. 4. To compare cardiorespiratory fitness in participants recruited as endurance trained to participants  randomized to UN-MOD and UN-VIG following 12 weeks of training. 5. To compare musculoskeletal fitness in participants recruited as endurance trained to participants randomized  to UN-RES following 12 weeks of training. 6. To collect phenotypic data that will allow for characterization of the study participants. These data will be  provided to the Coordinating Center and utilized by the Bioinformatics Center, Metabolomics and Proteomics  Analysis Sites, and Genomics, Epigenomics, and Transcriptomics Analysis Sites. 7. To collect biological data according to the study protocol that will provide data to examine the molecular and  cellular transducers in response to acute and chronic exposure to endurance or resistance exercise training.  These data will be provided to the Coordinating Center and utilized by the Bioinformatics Center,  Metabolomics and Proteomics Analysis Sites, and Genomics, Epigenomics, and Transcriptomics Sites."
"9450572","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant contributor to recalcitrant multi-drug resistant infections especially in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. Multi-drug and totally drug resistant strains of P. aeruginosa are increasing threats that contribute to high mortality in these patients (1, 2). Hence there is an urgent need to develop new strategies to combat P. aeruginosa and other resistant pathogens. The pathogenic profile of P. aeruginosa is related to its ability to secrete a variety of virulence factors and promote biofilm formation. Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism wherein P. aeruginosa secretes small diffusible molecules, specifically acyl homo serine lactones (AHL) such as 3O-C12-HSL that promote inter-bacterial communication, virulence, and biofilm formation (3, 4). Strategies that strengthen the ability of the host to inhibit these virulence factors would enhance host defenses and improve treatment. Over the previous funding cycle, we examined how lipid mediators regulate the lung host innate immune response to P. aeruginosa virulence factors (5-8). Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we discovered that prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), a product of L-PGD synthase, and its downstream metabolite, 15d-PGJ2, stimulate host response to P. aeruginosa (9-11). Further, we found that these immune-stimulatory effects are dependent on the nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?), a ligand-activated transcription factor with a wide spectrum of biological functions that includes metabolism, inflammation and redox balance (12).  Our preliminary data provide novel evidence that P. aeruginosa (strain PAO1) QS genes and molecules induce select miRNAs (including miR-27a and miR-130a) which reduce PPAR? levels in host cells? Furthermore treatment with PPAR? agonists induces host expression of paraoxonase 2 (PON-2), a mitochondrial enzyme with lactonase activity that hydrolyzes QS molecules. Induction of PON-2 inhibits biofilm formation by PAO1 on epithelial cells, improves epithelial integrity and enhances clearance of PAO1 in mouse lungs through inhibition of QS effects on cells. These findings support the novel hypothesis that P. aeruginosa evades host defenses by inhibiting PPAR? and downstream immunomodulatory effectors in host cells and that pharmacological PPAR? activation provides a complementary therapeutic approach to the treatment of P.aeruginosa infection.  This hypothesis will be examined in three interrelated specific aims: 1) Investigate the molecular mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa attenuates expression of PPAR?. miRs-27a and 130a, as post- transcriptional mechanisms will be interrogated to define the molecular underpinnings as to how QS systems attenuate PPAR? in host cells. 2) Determine the mechanisms by which PPAR? enhances immune defenses. PON-2 knockout or overexpressing lung epithelial cells infected with PAO1 and treated with PPAR? agonists or antagonists will further define the link between PON-2 induction and PPAR? functional effects. Analysis of tight junction proteins and biofilm formation will determine the functional impact of PPAR? on P. aeruginosa infected cells. 3) Define the impact of PPAR? modulation in P. aeruginosa lung infection in vivo. PPAR? activation will be accomplished using a currently available PPAR? agonist (pioglitazone), in mice infected intra-nasally with PAO1 and its mutants lacking QS systems.  The goal of this proposal is to define novel molecular approaches to stimulate immune response to virulent pathogens e.g. P. aeruginosa. Since pioglitazone is an FDA approved PPAR? agonist used in management of patients with type II diabetes, the results from these studies can be readily translated to human clinical trials. Completion of the proposed work will have fundamentally important implications and a major impact on the management of patients with resistant P. aeruginosa infections and will lay the ground work for testing therapies to treat difficult infections in human trials."
"9451622","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are common and often disabling conditions affecting many veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Enduring Freedom (OEF), and New Dawn (OND). Emerging evidence suggests that both conditions are associated with elevated levels of central and peripheral oxidative stress (OXS) and inflammation (INF). For this proposal, we have assembled a unique team of investigators with expertise in molecular genetics and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to study these processes in relation to chronic PTSD and mTBI. The study will draw from a large and psychiatrically heterogeneous cohort of veterans of OIF/OEF/OND, now on average 10 years post-deployment, with genome-wide genotype data available from a previous assessment. We will acquire new MRS scans for analysis in combination with the genomic data to examine associations of PTSD and mTBI with neural and peripheral indices of OXS and INF and identify genomic sources of individual differences in these associations. More specifically, the primary aims are to (a) examine associations between current PTSD, history of mTBI, and MRS measures of OXS and INF, (b) interrogate genes in the OXS and INF pathways to identify genetic moderators of the associations between PTSD, mTBI and MRS parameters, and (c) examine associations between MRS measures of OXS and INF, other MRI indices of neural integrity, and peripheral markers of OXS and INF. The ultimate goal of this study is to identify neurobiological pathways that can be used in the future to guide the development of blood panels and/or neuroimaging protocols for clinical assessment, as well as molecular targets for pharmacologic intervention for veterans suffering from chronic PTSD and mTBI."
"9442522","Wound healing is essential for survival. This is a multistep process involving a number of different cell types. Of particular relevance to this project is that wounding activates stem cells in the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and hair follicles (HF) to proliferate and send their progeny to re-epithelialize the wound and subsequently regenerate the epidermis. Failure to close wounds leads to medical costs estimated in the US at over $25 billion and affecting 6.5 million people. Our previous studies have shown that vitamin D and calcium signaling play important roles in these events. As we show in preliminary data, both the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) are required for the maintenance and activation of the stem cells in the HF and IFE. In the previous funding cycle we showed that lack of the VDR and CaSR are associated with a delay in wound closure. We hypothesized that VDR and CaSR are required both for the maintenance of the stem cell niches and their activation following wounding. This activation stimulates their proliferation and migration to re- epithelialize the wound. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis in that deletion of VDR (VDRKO) results in a reduction in the number of cells in the stem cell niches in both HF and IFE, that proliferation is reduced in the cells at the leading edge of the epithelium after wounding, that expression of axin 2 and CD44 as markers of stem cell activation is reduced, and that the leading edge of the epithelium at the wound is disorganized with reduction in the epithelial junctions (E-cadherin/catenin complexes) that appear to be required for migration of the keratinocytes across the wound as a first step in restoring the epidermis. Moreover, we demonstrated that topical application of a calcimimetic to activate the CaSR or calcitriol to activate the VDR accelerates wound healing, increasing the number and proliferation of the stem cells. Building on these promising preliminary we now propose to determine the mechanisms by which calcium and vitamin D signaling regulate the response of stem cells to wounding and the subsequent ability of their progeny to re-epithelialize the wound as the first step in restoring the epidermis. The hypothesis that we plan to test is: ?The VDR and CaSR in keratinocytes are required for the maintenance of the epidermal stem cell niche. Moreover, by regulating intracellular calcium dependent signaling mechanisms they enable the activation, proliferation, and migration of epidermal stem cells and their progeny following wounding to re-epithelialize the wound and subsequently regenerate the epidermis?. To test this hypothesis we propose the following three aims. 1 Determine whether vitamin D and calcium signaling via their receptors play distinct and/or complementary roles in epidermal stem cell function during re-epithelialization. 2. Determine whether VDR and CaSR are essential for the maintenance of the stem cell niches within the epidermis and hair follicle. 3. Determine the regulation of intracellular calcium signaling by VDR and CaSR and the role of such signaling in the activation and migration of stem cells after wounding. Poor wound healing is an important problem in the Veteran population. We expect our results will provide insight into the regulation of wound healing, potentially resulting in improved methods for treating chronic wounds by accelerating their re-epithelialization."
"9442052","The overarching goal of this proposal is to accelerate recruitment for clinical trials in a rare autoimmune disease, myositis, and to improve the current outcome measures for assessing treatment response by incorporating robust patient-reported outcomes and practical functional measures as metrics of response to future therapies. This approach addresses critical gaps in the conduct of myositis clinical trials: (1) Poor subject recruitment that geographically disenfranchises many myositis patients; (2) Lack of relevant patient-reported outcomes as a response metric to available therapies; and (3) Paucity of practical functional measures to longitudinally assess outcome in myositis patients with muscle weakness. Our goal is to establish a national cohort of myositis patients without geographic restriction using state-of-the-art technology (smart phone mobile applications and the web) coupled with tele-medicine techniques (tele-research) and to validate: (1) patient- reported metrics of PROMIS-physical function and (2) quantifiable metrics of functional outcome from physical activity monitors. Specific Aim 1 will establish the superiority of recruitment and enrollment of a tele-research cohort (TRC) compared to a myositis center-based cohort (CBC) while at the same time demonstrating that data collection and data integrity is uncompromised in the TRC compared to the CBC. This strategy can then be applied to future myositis clinical trials by enlisting the support of commercial laboratories for bio-specimen collection and mobile research units for drug delivery and trial monitoring activities. In addition, we have incorporated rigorous qualitative analysies to understand patients' perceptions and barriers towards myositis clinical trials using tele-research as compared to a center based approach. This will address key gaps in our knowledge and approach, ultimately leading to more effective and efficient clinical trial design in rare diseases. Specific Aim 2a will test the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of physical activity monitors as a novel functional and objective outcome measure in future myositis trials and Specific Aim 2b will address the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of PROMIS-physical function computer adaptive testing and the efficiency gained over the current patient-reported measures employed in myositis observational studies and clinical trials. The University of Pittsburgh Myositis Center has an excellent track record of successful observational studies and clinical trials and our preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility, capability, and proof of concept for all of the proposed measures. We have an established team of investigators with experience in myositis clinical trials, outcome measures along with expertise in qualitative analysis, website design and management, PROMIS and physical activity monitors. All of our data is stored in a robust prospective database that incorporates patient consenting, all forms of data entry and analysis, a modular approach to experimental protocols, and data extraction and analysis capabilities. The knowledge gained from the proposal will be invaluable to any future clinical trial in myositis."
"9190792","Performance measures are the specific care choices that are evaluated when judging the quality of care a doctor provides. Guiding quality of care with performance measurement was one of the greatest successes of the VHA transformation of the 1990s; reinvigorating performance measurement is a primary goal of today's VHA transformation. Current performance measures have known limitations. They do not personalize treatments' risks and benefits to individual patients. Some do not measure particularly important care or do not allow for appropriate patient- centered exceptions, such as for very ill patients. They create a burden for doctors. Doctors and clinical leaders have rarely had say in helping make scores useful and understandable. There is currently a push to summarize multiple performance measures into composite scores that measure a clinic's overall care. The best way to accomplish this, however, is unknown. Most health organizations and insurers use an approach that prioritizes simplicity. Medicare is developing an approach that prioritizes being able to distinguish one clinic from another ? have fewer ties. Here, we lay out a new ?benefit-based? approach; one that prioritizes the amount care can improve patient outcomes. Prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an ideal case for testing the performance measurement issues discussed above. It has an exceptionally strong clinical evidence base; CVD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in VA, and there has already been extensive work on developing individual performance measures. Furthermore, our work and that of others has already laid the groundwork for how care could be better personalized, and we already have a strong ongoing partnership with the VA Center for Analytics and Reporting. In this project, we propose examining alternative approaches to constructing composite performance measures for the medicines of CVD prevention, including statin, blood pressure, and anti-platelet therapies like aspirin. Can a more personalized, benefit-based CVD performance approach improve on conventional approaches to composite construction in reliability, validity, or usability? Is it feasible to create a composite that incorporates more clinical nuance, is preferred by VA leadership and frontline PACT members, and can be communicated in ways that help users improve their performance? This project focuses on CVD prevention, but the model being explored could be generalized to other conditions. In Aim 1, we will develop composite performance measures for cardiovascular disease prevention using three different techniques, including our new benefit-based approach. We will also explore the impact of different exclusions or improving data quality on performance measurement. In Aim 2, we will test and compare these new composite measures for reliability, validity, and their potential impact. In Aim 3, we will test the measures' acceptability and utility with clinicians and clinical and national leaders. This will include working with separate local and national stakeholder advisory groups and conducting formal semi-structured interviews. This will inform the measures themselves and how they are communicated to stakeholders."
"9444158","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication of medical and surgical diseases that has significant attributable morbidity and mortality in critically ill Veterans. Analysis of Veterans Health Administrative data reported that Veterans who develop AKI during a hospitalization are at substantial risk for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) within 1 year. Numerous therapeutic interventions have been evaluated in clinical trials to overcome this significant clinical challenge, with none proven successful. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill this gap in knowledge by discovering new targets that could be exploited for therapeutic interventions in AKI.  The lymphatic system is crucial for maintaining fluid balance, transporting lipids, and aiding in immune function. During pathological conditions that involve inflammation such as would occur in AKI and the AKI to CKD transition, these functions of the lymphatic system are further accentuated. Inflammation induces lymphangiogenesis through expression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), particularly VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and their receptor VEGF-R3. New lymphatic vessels can then aid in transition of inflammatory cells, removing the cellular debris from the microenvironment of inflammation-induced injury, draining the excess fluid and ultimately facilitating tissue repair. While recent studies have shown lymphangiogenesis to be an active participant in a number of inflammatory diseases, very little is known about the role of the lymphatic system and more importantly, lymphangiogenesis, in the pathogenesis of AKI and the AKI to CKD transition. Our preliminary data demonstrate a significant upregulation of lymphangiogenic markers along with increased lymphatic vessel density during AKI. Our central hypothesis is that inflammation associated lymphangiogenesis (IAL), regulated by VEGF-C expression in myeloid and proximal tubule cells, is involved in the resolution of inflammation following AKI and the AKI to CKD transition. The aims of this proposal are designed to 1) determine how lymphangiogenesis modulates AKI; 2) determine how lymphangiogenesis affects the AKI to CKD transition; and 3) determine the cross-talk between the proximal tubule and myeloid cells in regulating lymphangiogenesis, inflammation, and AKI. Successful completion of the aims of this project will help elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AKI during both injury and the recovery phases and have the potential to provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions in AKI."
"9451923","The ability to detect early cartilage damage in traumatic injury or degenerative arthritis has been limited, preventing treatment when therapies may be more beneficial. Depletion of proteoglycans/glycoproteins on the surface of the cartilage in these disorders results in unmasking of the underlying type II collagen (CII). This allows CII to serve as an immunologically recognizable target for monoclonal antibody to type II collagen (MabCII). MabCII can be fluorescently labeled for diagnosis of cartilage injury or cartilage degeneration or may be directly coupled to nanosomes encapsulating drugs for localized delivery to the cartilage lesion. Preliminary evidence shows a similar strategy can be used to target and recruit reparative chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells to the damaged site. In this application, MabCII will be used in a comprehensive treatment plan for directing reparative cells to lesions of the articular cartilage and meniscal cartilages. The therapeutic efficacy for repairing these cartilages will be monitored by an innovative fluorescent arthroscopy. In addition, we will optimize the recruitment and integration of the reparative cells in the cartilage lesions by reducing MMP production in the joint by intra-articular injection of an inhibitor of activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF- KB) pathway encapsulated in MabCII-targeted nanosomes. These procedures are extremely novel and paradigm shifting for the diagnosis and treatment of joint injury and disease. Our aims are: (1). To diagnose and characterize damaged and degenerative areas of articular surface and meniscal cartilages in the pig knee using a sensitive, MabCII antibody-guided method of fluorescent arthroscopy (FA). The knee of the domestic pig closely resembles a human joint in terms of joint size, weight-bearing requirements, and cartilage thickness and will be used in the characterization of surgically-induced injuries to meniscal and articular cartilages. The damage will be visualized through its binding to fluorescent MabCII using fluorescent arthroscopy, a new procedure that we have developed, and confirmed by histopathology. After FA characterization of the injury, (2) MabCII antibody will be used to target delivery and recruitment of reparative cells to the damaged areas of the knee joint cartilages. We will investigate the therapeutic efficacy of fluorescent, MabCII-targeted chondrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow and adipose tissues intra-articularly injected into joints where articular or meniscal cartilages have been surgically damaged monitoring the cellular localization and persistence by FA. Cell to cell recruitment at the cartilage lesion in the knee will be facilitated by an innovative system of biotin/avidin ligands on the surface of the reparative cells and multivalent antibody recruitment of cells binding type II collagen. Reparative tissues will be analyzed over time by histopathology and gene expression by RT-PCR. We will (3) further optimize the recruitment and integration of replacement cells in the cartilage lesion by treatment with MabCII targeted nanosomes loaded with an inhibitor of the activation of the NF-?B pathway. The production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is known to be a factor in degradation of cartilage matrices. Diminishing MMP production will be a prototypic target for enhancing reparative efforts. The MabCII-targeted nanosomes encapsulating a selective inhibitor of human IKK-2, an activator of the NF-?B pathway, will be used as a local delivery system to reduce production of MMPs in damaged cartilage lesions prior to treatment with reparative cells. ! ! !"
"9453723","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to link events with their temporal and situational contexts. This ability allows for memories to be truly autobiographical, and failures of episodic memory are signs of normal aging and neurodegenerative disease. The proposed research aims to illuminate the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying human episodic (contextually-mediated) memory through both computational modeling and the analysis of intracranial and scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings taken as neurosurgical patients and healthy adults search their memory for recently studied material. Using a model-based approach coupled with multivariate pattern analysis applied to electrophysiological data our ?rst aim is to elucidate the interacting roles f context and content information in episodic memory. We further seek to identify the anatomical substrates of content and context information in the process of memory formation, retrieval and reinstatement (Aim 2). Finally, we will carry out parallel invasive (intracranial EEG) and non-invasive (scalp EEG) studies to assess the viability of decoding neural signatures of episodic memory using non-invasive methods. This work will serve as an important bridge between the behavioral and neurobiological approaches to human memory, and will provide insights into the mechanisms of memory decline both in normal aging and in neurological disease."
"9626618","Project Summary The applicant, Veronica Rodriguez-Bravo, is committed to a long-lasting career in cancer research. Her goal is to become an independent investigator to study genome stability maintenance mechanisms regulated by nuclear pores (NPCs) and the mitotic checkpoint and the impact of defects on cancer. Veronica's three-year proposal will allow her to acquire skills to rigorously study NPC regulation in non- tumor and tumor cells and professional abilities necessary to become a successful independent group leader in the current challenging funding environment for young investigators. The scientific proposal aims to study the molecular and cellular details of the NPC-mitotic checkpoint axis that controls chromosomal stability and how errors impact tumor and non-tumor cells. Specifically, the proposed Aims seek to obtain mechanistic insights into how human cells integrate signals from the nuclear periphery (NPCs) and from mitotic chromosomes to protect genome integrity and examine how failure of these pathways contribute to chromosomal and NPC defects found in human cancers. Aim 1 will study the redundant regulation of Mad1, a key mitotic checkpoint protein, recruitment to chromosomes in mitosis and consequences of defects for tumor and non-tumor cells. Aim 2 will analyze the inter-connection and regulation of the NPC components implicated in the pre-mitotic signaling necessary for high fidelity mitosis. Aim 3 will examine how errors affecting the mitotic and the NPC signaling impact chromosomal stability, tumor cell division and survival and how weaknesses in tumor cells can be exploited for potential future targeted therapies. This proposal will generate essential data to understand how chromosomal and NPC signals feed to each other to ensure protection against chromosomal errors commonly found in cancer and also provide insights into how NPC defects and chromosomal abnormalities benefit tumor cell growth, survival and proliferation. With the mentorship of Dr. Jallepalli, and co-mentor Dr. Foley, the candidate will be able to expand her research skills, learn to write successful R01-type grants, produce preliminary new data for one or two manuscripts as corresponding author, secure a faculty position and interact with other scientists and collaborators to set the ground for a successful independent career. Importantly, she will acquire new technical skills learning novel methodologies of NPC sub-complexes purification from human cells to interrogate NPC composition and posttranslational modifications in tumor and non-tumor cells. In summary, Veronica and her mentors believe this proposal will be a critical opportunity to set the basis of her independent career as a biomedical cancer researcher and thus fulfill her dream of dedication to the study of cancer. In conclusion, this K award will be fundamental to provide Veronica protected time to successfully transition to research independence and contribute to the mission of the NIH and NCI."
"9189333","Background: Given significant concerns about risks and benefits, the VA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have each embarked on initiatives to reduce off-label use of antipsychotic medications (APs) for the nearly universal and burdensome behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). The percent of residents on APs in nursing homes (NH; in the VA, Community Living Centers or CLCs) is used by policymakers as the main quality indicator for BPSD. In addition to NH/CLCs, policymakers are also concerned with high rates of AP use in community settings. Using VA data from 1999- 2007, we previously found that AP use reductions following the 2005 FDA black box warning (regarding increased mortality for APs in dementia) were simply offset by increases in use of other classes of psychotropic medications, with no overall decrease in psychotropic use. Thus, policies focused entirely on reducing AP use may have caused ?unintended consequences,? such as providers shifting patients to alternative psychotropic classes with even less evidence of benefit and similar risks, including benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants. Rather than substituting other psychotropics, multiple expert bodies recommend the use of behavioral and environmental interventions as the preferred alternative to APs for BPSD. The VA has widely implemented a program to increase uptake of such interventions within CLC settings called STAR-VA. However, STAR-VA has to date been implemented in a minority of CLCs, does not target prescribing, and its sustained impact is unknown.  In partnership with the VA Office of Mental Health Operations, Mental Health Services, the Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative, STAR-VA, Geriatrics and Extended Care, and Pharmacy Benefits Management, this study will examine the system- and facility-level consequences of VA and non-VA initiatives related to dementia intended to reduce AP prescribing. Objectives: Aim 1: To determine system-level VA national trends (in both CLC and community settings) in psychotropic use among patients with dementia since the first black-box warning (2005) to 2014; Aim 2: To examine CLC-level variables that may be associated with AP prescribing in dementia (FY2014); and Aim 3: To validate additional quality indicators for VA patients with dementia for both CLC and community settings. Methods: In Aim 1, using interrupted time-series analyses, VA national health system administrative data (FY 2005-2014) will be used to examine the impact of initiatives to reduce antipsychotic use in dementia, with a focus on substitution patterns of other psychotropics for antipsychotics. We will also assess variation found in post-warning changes in AP and other psychotropic use in Veterans with dementia by variables including: race/ethnicity; academic affiliation; and geographic location. In Aim 2, CLC facilities classified into quintiles by mean facility-level AP prescribing (in FY 2013) will be compared on variables (derived from FY2014 data) that may reflect both unintended and desired consequences in quality of care for residents with BPSD, including: 1) other psychotropic use, physical restraint use, and health care utilization; 2) BPSD level prior to AP prescription; and 3) an available measure potentially reflecting quality of CLC care and non-pharmacologic strategy use (the Artifacts of Cultural Change or ACCT) and implementation of STAR-VA (yes/no). Informed by the findings from Aims 1 and 2 regarding factors that are associated with quality of care for veterans with dementia, in Aim 3, we will use a two-round modified Delphi panel of experts and stakeholders in dementia care and BPSD to validate additional, clinically-relevant quality indicators."
"9592680","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is in response to RFA Immune and Inflammatory Mechanisms in AD. A consortium of investigators with expertise in mouse models, behavior, surgery, histopathology, neurochemistry, immunology, brain aging and Alzheimer's disease have been assembled to approach the problem of systemic immune system influences on the development of AD pathology, specifically tau deposition. Two major questions are addressed. The first question regards the role of physiological aging in the nervous system, the cellular/humoral circulation or both in regulating the accumulation of tau pathology or modulating its impact upon the CNS. We plan to discern the relative contribution of CNS versus systemic influences by attempting to rejuvenate or senesce the systemic circulation and monitor the impact upon the tau phenotype in the brain of young and old mice. Our preliminary data indicate that even by middle age mice have enhanced sensitivity to tau over- expression, with accumulation of pathology when tauopathy is initiated at 11 mo, but not at 4 mo. The second question regards the influence of immunostimulants as sterile mimetics of different types of infections. Lipopolysaccharide will be used as a prototype, but immunostimulants mimicking viral and fungal infections will also be examined. An extensive human literature indicates that infections or trauma resulting in delirium increase risk of AD and accelerate the course of cognitive decline. We further expect these immunostimulants will exacerbate the tau pathology, and synergize with the age of the mice. Finally, we will seek to counter the impacts of age or innate immunostimulants by reversing the effects of aging on specific proteins in the circulation. This is based on recent work by others that indicate the rejuvenating effects of parabiosis can be replicated by supplementation with a single protein shown to decline during aging. Other work shows the senescing effects of parabiosis can be replicated by another individual protein that increases with age. We will discover additional candidate proteins through proteomic analysis of plasma protein responses to age and immunostimulant treatment. Success in these aims will provide candidate targets to be explored for intervention in individuals with delirium to make the cognitive decline reversible, as in younger individuals, rather than contributing to the onset or progression of dementia."
"9450815","Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of the majority of cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction, strokes, and heart failure leading to tremendous morbidity and mortality worldwide. Risk factor modification such as reductions in hyperlipidemia and hypertension constitute the only treatment strategy available for this vexing disease. Thus, there is an active effort to identify the culprit cellular processes that provide mechanistic insight. Reports of the pro-atherogenic phenotype of mice with a macrophage-specific autophagy deficiency has renewed interest in the role of the autophagy-lysosomal system in atherosclerosis. Lysosomes have the unique role of processing both exogenous material such as excess atherogenic lipids and endogenous cargo that includes dysfunctional proteins and organelles. Indeed, this is a primary mechanism by which macrophages can degrade excess lipids and cytotoxic materials present in the atherosclerotic plaque. Various lines of evidence demonstrate a progressive dysfunction in the autophagy-lysosome system of plaque macrophages suggesting that attempts at reprogramming the degradative capacity of macrophages might be a fruitful therapeutic area. Our work with TFEB, the predominant transcription factor regulating autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis, shows that enhancing TFEB function in macrophages leads to reductions in atherosclerosis of mice. In an attempt to harness this pathway therapeutically, we have uncovered a safe and natural sugar called trehalose, able to induce TFEB and autophagy-lysosome biogenesis in macrophages and recapitulate the atheroprotective properties. This raises the prospect of this sugar as a novel and practical therapy. In specific aim 1, we will dissect the mechanisms linking trehalose to macrophage autophagy- lysosomal biogenesis. In specific aim 2, we will determine the predominant autophagic processes in macrophages that underlie trehalose?s ability to reduce atherosclerosis. A major impediment to the therapeutic use of trehalose is degradation by the enzyme trehalase, present in higher organisms including mammals. In specific aim 3, genetic and pharmacological techniques of inhibiting trehalase will be used to determine if trehalose?s effects can be synergized. This proposal will test the hypothesis that trehalose can harness macrophage autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis to treat atherosclerosis."
"9606382","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is an application for a VA Rehabilitation Research and Development (RR&D) Small Projects in Rehabilitation Research (SPiRE) Award submitted by Blake K. Scanlon, Ph.D. He is currently a Clinical Research Associate (Assistant Professor equivalent) at the Stanford/VA Aging Clinical Research Center with a pending 8/8ths VA appointment subsequent to receipt of a RR&D CDA-2 (Dementia caregiver rehabilitation: enhancing Veteran and family-centered care, 1 IK2 RX001240-01A1; JIT process complete, start date pending). Dr. Scanlon is establishing himself as a clinician-scientist who conducts patient- and family-centered clinical research on dementia and neurodegenerative disease. This award will provide Dr. Scanlon and his team with the resources necessary to develop a novel project aiming to expand the reach of the CDA-2 intervention study by utilizing mobile media devices (i.e., tablets) to serve additional family caregivers of Veterans with dementia in the comfort of their own homes. To accomplish this goal, he has gathered a team that includes three Co-Investigators: Dr. Jerome Yesavage (a geriatric psychiatrist and renowned expert in cognitive and psychiatric functioning across the lifespan); Dr. Joy Taylor (a cognitive psychologist and expert in the trajectory of cognitive decline); and Dr. Lisa Kinoshita (a clinical neuropsychologist with expertise in the assessment and treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in dementia); a Senior Researcher: Dr. Mary Mittelman (an internationally renowned expert in dementia caregiver intervention) and a consultant: Dr. Booil Jo (a biostatistician with expertise in design/analysis of clinical trials, longitudinal data analysis, and missing data analysis). The proposed project studies the effects of an education and skill-building rehabilitation (ESBR) intervention, designed to be low-cost and clinically scalable using mobile media devices, on family caregivers of Veterans with dementia. A total of 40 caregivers caring for a Veteran with dementia will be randomized to mobile media ESBR intervention (ESBR-m; n=20) or to usual care plus paper educational materials (UC; n=20). Intervention effects will be examined at three months post-intervention. The Primary Aim of this study is to establish the feasibility of delivering a group-based intervention to family caregivers of Veterans through mobile media devices (e.g., tablets such as the iPad). Dr. Scanlon will also use advanced statistical techniques (e.g., mixed-effects modeling) to evaluate the impact of the intervention on: quality of life (Specific Aim 1); perceive stress and depressive symptoms (Specific Aim 2); and socialization and engagement in pleasant activities (Specific Aim 3) in caregivers of Veterans with dementia. This award will create an ideal environment where Dr. Scanlon and his team can establish the necessary pilot data to pioneer the development of low-cost, pragmatic and clinically translatable methods for improving rehabilitation and management of neurodegenerative disease and dementia within VHA."
"9015266","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: VA set an ambitious goal for ending homelessness among Veterans by 2015. HUD-VASH and Grant & Per Diem (GPD) are two primary VA housing programs to help Veterans exit homelessness. Substance abuse among Veterans in VA housing is a major risk factor for worsening psychopathology and housing instability. Despite recent adoption of a Housing First approach, many VA housing programs lack the staff infrastructure to manage substance use disorders (SUDs). This is a significant problem as 60% (conservative estimate) of Veterans in VA housing have SUDs and these Veterans show greater psychopathology compared to their counterparts without SUDs. These issues warrant substantial need for SUD programs in VA housing that are efficient to deploy, easily layered onto existing services, and require minimal staff to operate. The current study addresses this current void in VA treatment services in that it investigates the effectiveness, implementation process, and cost estimate of treatment of an adaptation of motivational interviewing, an empirically supported intervention with strong impact on reducing substance use and enhancing treatment engagement, in a group format, referred to as Group Motivational Interviewing (GMI) for Veterans with SUDs in VA housing. Data from this project, if shown to be promising, will establish the basis of a GMI dissemination and implementation course of action for highly vulnerable homeless Veterans in VA housing for achieving their greatest success in attaining housing stability. Background: There is a significant need for 'wraparound' treatment services in VA housing for addressing SUDs. Homeless Veterans with SUDs are vulnerable to treatment dropout, rendering them susceptible to relapse, while their continuation in outpatient care during their participation in VA housing leads to improved clinical outcomes. According to systematic reviews, individual MI reduces the incidence of SUD, when compared to no treatment, but is labor intensive. As VA moves toward a 'Housing First' paradigm where greater numbers of homeless Veterans will continue to use substances while in VA housing, delivery of GMI (which may be less labor intensive) to these patients will be important for initiating and maintaining their recovery as well as enhancing their psychosocial integration and quality of life. In a prior controlled trial conducted by the PI, GMI resulted in significantly higher outpatient treatment engagement and lower substance use compared to treatment-as-usual among dually diagnosed Veterans. Objectives: Study objectives are consistent with VA housing recommendations focusing on patient recovery, health services promotion, and treatment implementation evaluation. GMI will be compared to a control treatment condition (CT) on (Specific Aim I; Five outcomes: (Primary H1): treatment engagement; (Primary H1): substance use; (Secondary H2): psychosocial integration (e.g., social support, community participation); (Secondary H3) quality of life/psychiatric indices; and (Secondary H4): number of days engaging in structured/productive work activities in the 6-month follow up. Specific Aim II involves a process evaluation for documenting (A) formative (e.g., developmental), (B) process, and (C) summative outcomes; and Specific Aim III involves estimation of cost of intervention in terms of direct costs, indirect costs of staff, costs of capital and workload measures for future implementation and dissemination research. Methods: Randomized controlled trial comparing GMI to CT across five critical outcomes. 186 Veterans in VA housing services (93 per treatment arm) will be enrolled with a diagnosis of alcohol or drug abuse/dependence. Recruitment will take place in Charleston VAMC HUD-VASH & GPD. Participants will be randomly assigned to (1) GMI or (2) CT, each consisting of 4 sessions, and will be evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months. Participants with a non-substance related DSM-IV-TR major Axis I disorder (e.g., MDD, PTSD) will be eligible for the study. Analyses will be conducted using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) approach."
"9471225","Project Summary Co-location networks ? two-mode networks that capture connections between individuals and locations in geographic space ? have broad relevance in the health sciences in areas ranging from the study of infectious disease transmission to understanding the influence of social processes on health outcomes and behaviors. Despite their broad relevance, however, statistical methods for understanding co-location networks are limited. This methodologically oriented proposal focuses on the development of a statistical framework for the study of co-location networks using a bilinear mixed-effects model with interacting latent activity pattern motifs and profiles. Through latent interacting random effects, our model captures the dependence between individuals based on their shared use of space and between locations based on the individuals who frequent them. Our flexible modeling framework uses a mixed-membership structure to relax the assumption that activity profiles are static and takes advantage of a data augmentation strategy to allow versions of the model with either direct or indirect specification of the dependence between actor-location ties. Our novel statistical models will be used in analyses of activity pattern data collected as part of the Adolescent Health and Development in Context (AHDC) Study, an ongoing data collection effort in Franklin County, Ohio. Through GPS-based smartphone tracking and space-time budget software, the AHDC Study provides rich detail on the co-location networks of adolescents in the study area. In addition, a wealth of survey data, smartphone-administered Ecological Momentary Assessments (capturing real-time measures of location, social network partner presence, activities, risk behaviors, and mood), and biomeasure data on the study participants are available. Recognizing that our proposed statistical model may not be able to capture the structure the co-location network structure of AHDC adolescents based entirely on their observed activity patterns, we also propose to embed relevant information derived from social media into our analyses through informative prior distributions on model parameters. To do so, we propose novel data mining algorithms to retrieve potential activity pattern motifs and coincident profiles from Twitter posts and network structure. In particular, we extend named entity identification methods to the spatial setting to automatically retrieve information relevant to activity patterns and develop novel methods for prioritizing activity pattern information based on its relevance to particular subpopulations (here, adolescents) using scalable sentiment analysis. Using our new statistical and data mining methodology, we will perform detailed statistical analyses to explore the relationship between spatial and socio-spatial exposures derived from an inferred co-location network and physiological stress in adolescents."
"9276512","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed study is to explore the potential therapeutic benefit of a novel approach to rehabilitation of motor control of the paretic distal upper limb in stroke survivors. This multimodality treatment combines administration of a pharmacological agent for reducing unwanted neuromuscular hyperexcitability with a training paradigm focused on expanding exploration of the muscle activation workspace. In our previous research, we have observed striking deficits in the generation of proper muscle activation patterns in the hand. Motoneuronal hyperexcitability, especially of the long finger-flexors, is readily apparent, as is a diminished capacity to appropriately modulate activation patterns according to task. The proposed study would directly address these complications. Accordingly, we will pursue the following aims:  Aim 1: Determine the extent to which anti-serotonergic agents outperform conventional medications in reducing hyperexcitability post-stroke without impacting voluntary activation or alertness. Tizanidine hydrochloride, a clinically administered anti-spasticity medication, has been shown to effectively reduce motoneuron hyperexcitability, presumably through noradrenergic pathways, but causes serious side effects including somnolence. In preliminary studies we identified a promising alternative drug, the anti-serotonergic agent cyproheptadine hydrochloride, which was able to reduce hyperexcitability without reducing voluntary strength for single doses. We will compare the effects of tizanidine and cyproheptadine at chronic dosages. We hypothesize that: cyproheptadine will be more effective than tizanidine in reducing unwanted hyperexcitability without diminishing strength or increasing somnolence.  Aim 2: Assess the efficacy of using a multimodality intervention combining monoaminergic agents with upper extremity training. We anticipate that combining administration of the monoaminergic drug found effective in Aim 1 to reduce flexor hyperexcitability with focused training to alter muscle activation patterns will facilitate rehabilitation. Two different training techniques will be compared, one focusing directly on the training of muscle activation patterns through a custom computer game and the other utilizing a novel occupational therapy training protocol. We hypothesize that: the combined therapy of the drug with the training will lead to greater functional improvement over either drug administration or therapeutic training alone. Further, we hypothesize that: for the groups receiving multimodal training, improvements in motor control, will be greater for those training with the electromyographically controlled computer games.  The proposed study is aimed at contributing to the establishment of new techniques for maximizing recovery of motor function of the paretic upper limb post-stroke, especially in individuals with more severe distal impairment. The results of this study will have immediate import for clinical practice for stroke rehabilitation."
"9469384","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States, causing nearly 600,000 deaths each year. A critical aspect of cancer progression is evasion of the immune system. The B7 and CD28 families of ligands and receptors mediate essential costimulatory or coinhibitory pathways; pathways that promote or suppress the immune system, respectively. B7x (B7-H4, B7S1 or VTCN1) is a newly discovered member of the B7-family that inhibits T-cell proliferation and effector functions. It is frequently overexpressed in a wide variety of human cancers, and is generally correlated with advanced disease status and poorer clinical outcomes. Previously, we demonstrated in a mouse model that B7x promotes tumor metastasis and promotes immunosuppressive cell populations such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Further, we also showed that blockade of B7x reduces tumor metastasis, alters the tumor-infiltrating immune population to favor anti-tumor effector cells, and confers long-term immunity against tumor rechallenge. Thus, we propose two aims: (1) Elucidate the regulation and function of B7x and its role in tumor progression (2) Develop and characterize anti-B7x therapy and its effect on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. For our first aim, we will explore tumor-associated hypoxia as a mechanism for B7x expression. Further, we will characterize the effects B7x has on the survival and generation of MDSCs. Lastly, we will investigate the role of B7x in tumor development and progression in vivo by generating a mouse spontaneous cancer model. In our second aim, we will develop and characterize B7x-targeted therapy. First, we have generated several clones of human B7x-specific monoclonal antibodies, which we will test for efficacy with our experimental metastasis model in vivo. Next, in context of the long-term anti-tumor immunity conferred by anti-B7x therapy, we will investigate how B7x blockade alters memory T-cell populations. Lastly, we will test B7x blockade in combination with established checkpoint inhibitors and determine if combination therapy has synergistic effects. With these studies, we seek to gain a better understanding of the functional contribution of B7x to tumor progression, and establish it as a prime target for immunotherapy."
"9450814","The previous period of Merit support allowed us to develop novel protocols for immuno-affinity isolation and characterization of very pure protein aggregates. We began with C. elegans models of neurodegenerative diseases, and then applied the same protocols to purify A?42- and tau-containing aggregates from affected hippocampal tissue of Alzheimer's patients, seeking aggregate proteins that differentiate them from age-matched controls. We now propose to apply our experience with these models to develop novel therapeutic agents that might delay, prevent, or even reverse Alzheimer's and Parkinson's pathology, through the following Aims: Aim 1. We have access through Dr. Sue Griffin, our collaborator, to a tissue bank of tissue samples from Alzheimer's Disease (caudal hippocampus) and Parkinson's Disease (substantia nigra), from which we will isolate aggregates by immuno-affinity for A?42, tau and ?-synuclein. We propose to cross-link these aggregates, thoroughly digest them with trypsin, and identify cross-linked peptide pairs that will reveal the protein-protein interactions that mediated their conglomeration. We will use state-of-the-art ?click chemistry? reagents to create, tag and recover cross-link sites, and Xlink Identifier software to analyze mass-spectrometry data. To visualize, integrate and interpret the protein-protein interactions thus revealed, we will create protein-interaction networks and analyze them with tools adapted to the nonfunctional interactions that predominate in protein aggregation. Aim 2. Proteomics data from Aim 1 will define critical protein-protein interactions within aggregates containing tau, A?42 or ?-synuclein, which are highly enriched in Alzheimer or Parkinson brain samples. These protein- protein interactions will be ranked on the basis of their predicted propensity (by ?G estimation) and stability (by molecular-dynamic simulations). The top 10 protein interfaces from each pulldown will then serve as targets for in silico screening of drug libraries developed to disrupt protein-protein interactions. Such libraries, constructed in diverse ways, include many `PPII' drugs designed to block specific protein-pair interactions, but which have frequently found applications beyond their original targets. For each target, we will perform initial screens of PPII-library drugs in silico, from which the top candidates will be retested in molecular-dynamic simulations. Aim 3. The drugs predicted in silico to most effectively disrupt key protein interactions (Aim 2) will be tested in vivo for reduction of aggregate formation?first in human neuronal-cell cultures expressing APPSwe (forming amyloid aggregates) or split-GFP::tau (fluorescing upon tau oligomerization). For drugs that are protective in either assay, tests will also be conducted in C. elegans aggregation models expressing A?42, tau, or ?-synuclein. Biotinylated versions of 4?6 top candidates will be assessed for activity, and active biotinylated drugs will be used to pull down proteins to which the drug attaches. This will be done initially in C. elegans, using an in-house `genomewide' RNAi-knockdown library, and will then be cross-checked by introducing shRNA constructs into cultured neuronal cells. Targets producing maximal protection will then be tested to ask whether drug efficacy is partially redundant with RNAi knockdown, as expected for a target that mediates the drug's protective effects. By discovery of novel drugs designed specifically to reduce aggregation, we expect to find far more effective therapeutic and preventative agents than the limited drugs currently available. Based on our observations that many aggregate components are shared among diverse neurodegenerative-disease models, at least some of these drugs may also prove effective against a variety of other neurodegenerative diseases including orphan diseases."
"9417201","Summary The project has historically studied the action of tumor suppressor genes, and is based on the premise that tumor suppressors reveal key regulatory nodes in growth control processes and the strategies nature uses to combat cancer. Based on our observation that certain oncogenes promote apoptosis through p53, we initially explored the mechanisms by which p53 suppressed apoptosis and how disruption of p53 network components promoted tumorigenesis and impacted therapy response. Taking advantage of program collaborations, we later established how p53 loss sustains tumorigenesis and, by combining oncogenomics, functional genomics, and in vivo genetic screens, established the functional relevance of many cancer drivers. Over the last funding cycle, we expanded our efforts towards understanding how tumor suppressor loss is required for tumor maintenance, showing that re-establishing tumor suppressor networks can have profound and distinct anti- proliferative effects, even in advanced cancers. This evolution spawned our current interest in ?tumor maintenance genes? ? genes needed to sustain cancer progression ? and stimulated the development of new mouse models that enable suppression and/or reactivation of gene function at different stages of disease. Moving forward, the project will focus on the identification and characterization of tumor suppressor and tumor maintenance genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) ? two primary liver cancers for which genomic studies have identified few ?druggable? cancer drivers, and for which no effective therapies exist. As such, we now propose to characterize how mutations in certain chromatin-modifying genes ? which are common in human tumors but are poorly understood - drive tumor initiation and maintenance, and to implement new genetic and genomic tools to identify and validate therapeutic targets for primary liver cancers driven by these altered gene products. Our approach combines mouse models, genetic tools, and cancer genomics in a coordinated manner that enables the comprehensive interrogation of tumor suppressor and tumor maintenance network, and benefits from multiple interactions with other projects and cores. The project will produce a more complete understanding of how primary liver cancers are initiated and maintained while simultaneously validating new therapeutic targets for these diseases. As such, our project addresses an urgent and unmet clinical need."
"9605566","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The physiological repair of severe bone fractures in patients often results in incomplete bone closure. Bmp-2 has been used clinically to improve bone repair. However even with the use of Bmp-2, a strong inducer of osteoblast differentiation, obtaining complete bone closure is still a problem. Moreover, current treatments have led to multiple medical complications due to supra-physiological levels of Bmp-2 required to promote repair bone. Therefore there is a need to identify new candidates that can improve Bmp-2 efficacy in bone healing. High concentrations of Bmp-2 are required in part because of our limited understanding of the role the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays in Bmp-2 signaling during bone repair. Given the relatively large number ECM proteins known to negatively regulate Bmp-2-mediated bone formation it is important to identify positive ECM modulators of Bmp-2 signaling. We have recently reported that the ECM protein, Fibulin-1 (Fbln1) is a positive modulator of bone formation that binds Bmp-2 and acts to promote osteoblast differentiation. In order to further our mechanistic understanding of Fbln1 in bone formation and address the role of Fbln1 in bone regeneration we have proposed two specific aims 1) Define the region(s) within Fibulin-1 responsible for Bmp-2-mediated induction of Osterix and Bmp-2 binding 2) Determine if Fibulin-1 is required for repair of critical size calvarial defects."
"9428394","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  My overarching goal is to become an independent investigator in the area of lifestyle interventions for prevention and reduction of cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF) in adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). The purpose of this application is to augment my previous training in obesity, behavioral science and research design with additional tools necessary to make this transition.  As a behavioral scientist, my research and clinical practice focus on lifestyle interventions for obesity. After completion of my doctorate in Health Education and Promotion, I completed a competitive T-32 fellowship in Comparative Effectiveness Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), with special focus on tailoring lifestyle interventions for specific populations. This training furthered my understanding of adapting interventions for specific needs of special populations and measuring the effectiveness of these interventions using randomized controlled trials and real world clinical trials. Throughout my doctoral and post-doctoral training, I also received clinical training in the UAB Department of Nutrition Sciences. In this clinical role, I learned nutritional and physical activity considerations for treating obesity in a variety of chronic diseases, as well as how to incorporate behavior change strategies to improve adherence to dietary and exercise recommendations. I also had the opportunity to work with individuals with a variety of physical disabilities including SCI. It was during this clinical training that I began to understand the barriers individuals with physical disabilities face in developing healthy dietary and activity routines, and the lack of evidenced-based recommendations for reducing obesity and other CMRF in this population.  To further my training, this career development award (CDA) will focus on three goals. First, I will increase my understanding of the unique disease processes associated with SCI that influence cardiometabolic risk factors after injury. Second, I will augment my current knowledge of psychosocial determinants of obesity with an increased understanding of the unique determinants of behavior change in adults with SCI. Third, I aim to increase my understanding of how to leverage emerging technology to develop novel interventions that can directly address barriers to adherence among adults with SCI. Completion of these training goals, along with the proposed study will put me in a position to apply for R01 level funding by the end of the CDA period.  Despite significant evidence on CMRF and obesity among adults with SCI, there is little evidence on the best methods for addressing these significant health issues. Lifestyle interventions consisting of diet and exercise recommendations along with behavioral strategies to increase adherence to these recommendations, are considered the first line of treatment for weight loss and reduction of CMRF, but little research has explored how to adapt these interventions for adults with SCI. Specifically, dietary adherence continues to be an obstacle to long term weight maintenance, and this may be compounded in adults with SCI given the metabolic, psychosocial and environmental barriers associated with this disability. Reduced carbohydrate (CHO) diets have been found to improve CMRF in non-SCI groups. They have also been associated with decreased hunger and cravings, and improved mood and energy levels, all of which may lead to improved dietary adherence. The purpose of the proposed study is to assess differences in dietary adherence, body composition and insulin, glucose, lipids and hs-CRP between a reduced CHO and standard diet in obese adults with SCI. This study will employ a novel home-based telehealth intervention utilizing an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) platform designed specifically for individuals with SCI.  I have developed an excellent mentoring team to guide this CDA. James Rimmer, PhD, will serve as primary mentor. Dr. Rimmer is internationally known for his work in exercise, health promotion and physical disabilities and currently serves as the inaugural UAB/Lakeshore Foundation Endowed Chair in Health Promotion and Rehabilitation Science. Barbara Gower, PhD will serve as co-mentor and will oversee my training in CMRF including trainings in measuring and interpreting body composition, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These mentors, along with consultants Kathleen Martin Ginis, PhD, Leslie McClure, PhD, and Yu-ying Chen, MD, PhD, will guide me through the proposed training program and ensure completion of the proposed study.  The resources afforded to me by my mentoring team and UAB are excellent. I will be involved in research and training in the UAB Departments of Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy, as well as the PhD program in Rehabilitation Science. Additionally, I will work closely with the UAB/Lakeshore Research Collaborative, which serves as a partnership between leading UAB researchers and state-of-the-art fitness and health promotion programs for people with physical disabilities.  In conclusion, my research and clinical experience make me an excellent candidate for the K01 Mentored Career Development Award in Medical Rehabilitation Research. I believe that the completion of the proposed training plan and study, in conjunction with guidance from an outstanding mentor team and the resources afforded to me by UAB offer an excellent opportunity to complete my transition to independent investigator."
"9417196","PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The overall goal of this Program is to understand how basic cellular processes are altered and co-opted by cancer cells to promote tumor initiation and progression, and to apply this knowledge towards development of new therapeutic approaches. During the past 46 years, the strong underlying basic science foundation of the Program Project has allowed members to identify vulnerabilities in cancer and develop novel and highly specific therapeutic strategies. This Program continues to take a multi-pronged approach grounded in basic cancer research to identify and disrupt the molecular dependencies underlying cancer. Within this Program, there are five highly integrated Projects (Chromosome Inheritance; Regulation of Pre- mRNA Splicing in Tumorigenesis; Long Non-Coding RNAs and Cancer; Transcriptional Coactivators and Enhancers In Human Cancer; Tumor Suppressor and Tumor Maintenance Genes) and four innovative Cores that are using cutting edge technologies to study the molecular mechanisms of cancer biology. To achieve the Program's goals, these studies will exploit novel animal models of human cancers, pioneering functional genomics technologies, therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide strategies against otherwise undruggable targets, and cutting-edge methods in biochemistry, cell biology and molecular biology. The researchers will interrogate the basis of many of the most devastating types of tumors, including leukemias, breast, pancreatic, and highly aggressive liver cancers. All of this work is supported by four Cores that provide access to technologies, services, and expertise that all combine to enhance productivity and promote interactions. The interactive and collaborative nature of this Program guides each of these Projects beyond their singular potential. Research in all five Projects touches on overlapping themes and benefits from the expertise of the other Program members. Together, this Program is making significant progress towards its goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets that will substantially impact cancer treatment."

"9405544","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vision is critical for effective control of action. The dorsal stream projects to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and transforms visual input into corresponding responses to guide movements of different effectors. An influential model proposes that the dorsal stream is organized into dedicated visuomotor channels that are effector-specific and operate independently. Experiments for this proposal seek to rigorously test this model against alternatives in which channels guide movements of multiple effectors and can interact. We will first test whether coordinating visually-guided behaviors recruits effector-specific processes by recording neurons in the parietal reach system (Aim 1) and the parietal saccade system (Aim 2) during coordinated behavior. We will then test whether channels operate independently or interact by measuring the strength and functional significance of cross-areal coherence between the parietal reach and saccade systems (Aim 3). Despite the central role of coordination to visual behavior, how visual space for reaching and eye movements influence each other and whether cross-areal interactions within PPC underlie this influence is not known. Understanding the mechanisms of coordinated visual behavior will help us understand how visual behavior arises from interactions between different visual representations more generally. Damage to the PPC leads to optic ataxia, apraxia and neglect, is debilitating, and is suffered by many patients each year in the US with significant social costs Understanding how the brain constructs visual-spatial representations underlies the effective treatment of patients with posterior parietal damage."
"9516204","Abstract Influenza virus infections result in substantial illness, mortality and societal impact worldwide. Influenza A virus (IAV) infections originate in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and can become systemic, potentially resulting in multi-organ failure and death. Neutrophils play a critical role in the vertebrate immune response to bacterial and fungal infections, but until recently it had been assumed that neutrophils are not essential for immune defense against viral infections. Recent evidence, however, suggests that neutrophils are involved in the immune response to IAV and may give rise to both positive and negative outcomes resulting from inflammation. This research will determine whether neutrophils, in the process of controlling IAV infections, trigger excessive inflammation through mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and signaling via the cytokine, type I interferon. In the proposed project, the zebrafish serves as a novel animal model in which the innate immune response to influenza viral infection can be studied in the context of the whole animal. This work will involve a combination of molecular techniques and imaging microscopy to identify molecular mechanisms that are responsible for neutrophil recruitment to localized sites of infection in an effort to identify potential targets for intervention. Individual components of the respiratory burst, such as NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase, regulate ROS levels in order to contain IAV infections. By dissecting the pathways that control respiratory burst function, we expect to characterize how ROS control neutrophil behavior during an IAV infection to coordinate the antiviral response. We will determine how hyperinflammation occurs as part of an IAV infection so that therapeutic measures that preserve the antiviral response, yet contain the associated inflammation, can be developed. Through these studies we hope to gain valuable insight into the neutrophil response to IAV infection and the specific factors controlling the balance between optimum antiviral activity and excessive inflammation. Our new understanding will lead to positive human health benefits by serving as the basis for development of treatment strategies for maintaining effective antiviral activity against IAV infections while controlling the potentially damaging effects of the neutrophil inflammatory response."
"9524253","Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source ? the true gold standard for PET AC ? will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially."
"9406692","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly 195,800 men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (PCa) in the United States each year face difficulty in deciding whether potentially harmful PCa treatment is necessary due to our inability to accurately distinguish between indolent and aggressive PCa. Established prediction nomograms based on routine clinical and pathological features of PCa misclassify up to 60% of men with clinically significant cancer, most likely because these models do not effectively account for the myriad of biological mechanisms that can underlie metastatic potential. For the same reason, these existing prediction tools offer little insight on potential molecular targets for PCa treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that aberrant DNA methylation of numerous genes, including metastasis suppressors and genes that maintain cell differentiation status, is a major mechanism underlying tumor metastatic progression. We hypothesize that tumor DNA methylation of specific genes are predictive of PCa metastatic progression beyond routine clinical and pathological prognostic factors. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop DNA methylation marker-based prediction algorithms that will assist clinicians when providing therapeutic recommendations for men with localized PCa. Existing PCa study populations consist predominately of treated patients. They are not well-suited to address whether tumor DNA methylome measureable at PCa diagnosis is an important risk factor for metastasis because PCa treatment can alter disease course in at least some of these men. To evaluate the prognostic utility of DNA methylation markers measurable from diagnostic PCa biopsy, we propose a nested case-control study based on a retrospective cohort of 9,563 men who did not receive treatment when diagnosed with localized, Gleason grade 6-7 PCa (1997-2006) at Kaiser Permanente (KP). We will include 450 cases with metastasis and 450 matched controls selected during a 10-year follow-up period. The Specific Aims are: (1) to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation status of selected candidate genes can predict risk of PCa metastasis; (2) to identify novel DNA methylation markers of genes with previously unrecognized utility in predicting PCa metastasis from genome-wide methylation profiling using a discovery approach; and (3) to develop prediction algorithms of the 10-year risk of metastasis in men with localized PCa based on existing clinical PCa prognostic criteria and subsequently incorporating DNA methylation markers. This application takes advantage of unique resources in place at KP, University of California Los Angeles and San Francisco, and University of Southern California, leveraging a multidisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in prognosis studies, PCa epidemiology, epigenetics, pathology, clinical urology, and biostatistics. At the completion of these aims, we will identify DNA methylation markers that are predictive of PCa metastasis, provide insights on the molecular determinants of metastatic progression, and develop novel risk algorithms that extend existing algorithms to metastasis. 1"
"9457829","|| ABSTRACT Breakdown of the endothelial cell barrier is considered a defining pathological hallmark of multiple diseases. Indeed, sepsis accounts for more hospital deaths per year than any other condition in the United States, and the disease is currently devoid of any targeted pharmacological intervention. Critical to understanding how inflammation affects vascular barrier function is that endothelial cells throughout the circulatory system are not homogenous. Inflammation specifically affects vascular permeability through effects on the venous endothelium, whereas the arterial endothelium is not susceptible to inflammation-induced permeability and instead primarily regulates blood pressure and angiogenesis. Thus, a mechanistic view of how venous endothelial barrier function is regulated is essential to human health and disease. Our current understanding of vascular barrier function does not account for endothelial heterogeneity and the unique cell adhesion and signaling pathways specific to each endothelial cell type. Purinergic signaling has been identified as a key regulator of endothelial permeability; however the means by which purine nucleotides are brought into and affect the local environment has never been identified. We hypothesize that venous endothelial barrier function is regulated by a localized purinergic signaling cascade that controls the stability and expression of tight junction proteins. We will use three aims to test this concept. In Aim 1, we will determine roles for Pannexin 1 in regulating venous endothelial permeability. This aim will use novel methods for ex vivo vein isolation and measure transendothelial resistance and dye movement from endothelial cell specific Panx1 knockout mice and endothelial cell specific Panx1 over-expressing mice, as well in vivo testing using the cecal ligation puncture (CLP) septic model. In Aim 2, we will measure the relative contributions of different Adenosine Receptors (ARs) on endothelial barrier function. We will determine the differential role of CD39 and CD73 on adenosine receptor activation, using endothelial cell specific A2A and A2B floxed mice, as well as the relative contribution of PKA or PKC upon activation. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will define roles for claudin-11 in venous endothelial barrier function and as a target for TRPV4-mediated disruption of tight junctions. This aim will utilize state of the art calcium imaging to determine a role for TRPV4 in regulation of claudin-11 production, trafficking, assembly and stability. Claudin-11 is a novel claudin isoform whose role in barrier function is only beginning to be elucidated. Molecular manipulation of claudins will be used to demonstrate that claudin-11 is required for veins to be sensitive to calcium fluxes because it has the unique capacity to bind calmodulin, whereas claudin-5 does not. The feasibility of accomplishing these aims is underscored by all proposed knockout mice being in hand, an IRB in place for human samples, and strong preliminary data."
"9625072","DESCRIPTION: Infection with HIV-1 can induce dementia for which a treatment is currently not available. Experimental evidence from our and other laboratories strongly suggests that HIV-1 infection and neurotoxic stimulation of microglia and macrophages (M?) in the brain trigger neuronal damage and impairment of neurogenesis. We recently observed that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 was required in both M?/microglia for induction of HIV/gp120 toxicity and in neurons for initiation of apoptosis by M? toxins. In follow-up studies we found that knockdown of p38? MAPK by specific siRNAs down-regulated cysteinyl leukotriene synthase (LTC4S) in M?. We also discovered that blockade of the cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) protected cerebrocortical neurons against toxicity of gp120-stimulated or HIV-infected M?. Therefore, we propose to study in vivo how genetic deletion of LTC4S or blockade of CysLTR1 affects brain injury caused by HIV-1 or its envelope gp120. We hypothesize that ablation of CysLT production or CysLTR1 inhibition can prevent HIV and gp120 from inducing neuronal injury and behavioral impairment. The long-term objectives are to find new protective strategies against brain injury by HIV infection. The specific aims (SA) are: (1) To determine in vivo whether genetic deletion of cysteinyl-leukotriene synthase (LTC4S) prevents neuronal injury and behavioral impairment in a HIV/gp120 transgenic mouse model. (2) To investigate in vivo whether pharmacological inhibition of CysLTR1 ameliorates neuronal damage in a HIV/gp120 transgenic mouse model. (3) To assess in vitro how the blockade of CysLTR1 or knockout (KO) of LTC4S enables neuronal survival in the presence of HIV-induced macrophage toxins. Transgenic mice expressing HIV/gp120 will be cross-bred with LTC4SKO animals (SA1) and Montelukast will be used to block CysLTR1 (SA2). Memory and cognition-based behavioral performance, neuronal injury and glial cell activation will be compared in LTC4SKO versus wild-type and Montelukast- versus vehicle-treated HIV/gp120-transgenic mice for SA1 and 2, respectively. For SA3, we will use pharmacological inhibition of CysLTR1 besides LTC4SKO and wild-type cerebrocortical neurons and astrocytes exposed to conditioned media of HIV-infected and un-infected, primary human M?. All three SAs will employ multi-dimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics to profile CysLTs in comparison to other cellular lipids and mediators in different parts of the brain (SA1 and 2) and neurons, astrocytes and M? (SA3). For all three SAs neuronal injury and death will be analyzed by deconvolution microscopy after immunolabeling for neuronal cellular and synaptic markers and staining of nuclear DNA by Hoechst dye. All three Specific Aims will test the premise that deletion of CysLT production or blockade of CysLTR1 prevents inflammatory and injurious processes in favor of neuroprotective mechanisms, such as reduced activity of p38 MAPK and Caspase 3, and increased activity of Akt,. We will also assess in vivo whether LTC4SKO and CysLTR1 blockade can preserve memory and cognition and ameliorate gliosis in the presence of HIV/gp120."
"9644457","The proposed research seeks to determine whether text messages/messaging (TM) or a mobile application (app), compared with an educational website-control provided to all Veterans, can improve adherence to antiplatelet therapy among patients following acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention (ACS/PCI). Adherence to antiplatelet medications is critical to prevent life- threatening complications (i.e., stent thrombosis); yet rates of non-adherence range from 21-57% by 12 months. Mobile technology through TM or mobile apps is a practical and inexpensive strategy to promote behavior change and enhance medication adherence. The three specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine preferences for content and frequency of TM to promote medication adherence through focus groups; 2) determine the most patient-centered app to promote adherence through a content analysis of all commercially available apps for medication adherence and focus groups centered on usability; and 3) compare adherence to antiplatelet medications in 225 Veterans post ACS/PCI through a randomized clinical trial. Participants will be randomized to either TM, mobile app, or website-control group. The focus groups will be stratified by low/high mobile phone use and sex. In addition, the proposed work will provide Dr. Park with the mentorship and experience necessary to establish herself as an early career investigator in the fields of cardiovascular disease prevention and mobile health research. Dr. Park's primary career goal is to become an independent nurse investigator who applies novel technology for patient-centered behavioral interventions to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for cardiac patients and Veterans. Dr. Park has assembled an outstanding interdisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in the required areas of training. Eileen Collins, PhD, RN will serve as Primary Nurse Mentor; Mary Whooley, MD will serve as VA On-Site Mentor; and Janet Shim, PhD will serve as Qualitative Research Mentor. In addition, John Boscardin, PhD will conduct all quantitative statistical analyses related to the study. Consultants include Yoshimi Fukuoka, RN, PhD (expert in mobile health strategies) and Dr. Michael Ho (expert in medication adherence and cardiovascular disease). Susan Woods, MD, MPH (Director of Patient Experience, Connected Health, Office of Information and Analytics, VHA) will serve as a collaborator, particularly in relationship to our use of ?Annie,? the new VA automated TM program with a goal to help patients take a more active role in their health. The Nursing Research Initiative will provide Dr. Park with an exceptional opportunity to receive the mentorship and experience necessary to prepare a strong scientific foundation for a compelling Investigator Initiated Research proposal to evaluate clinical outcomes (i.e., cardiac morbidity and mortality) through a multi-site full scale RCT. Determining the efficacy of mobile technology through a Veteran-designed protocol to promote medication adherence will have a significant impact on Veteran health and public health, particularly for individuals with chronic diseases that require strict medication adherence.  "
"9450663","Chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) is a worldwide health problem that can lead to cirrhosis, end stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of the HCV epidemic, the incidence of HCC is rising at an alarming rate and US veterans with cirrhosis have 5-8% lifetime risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). New, highly effective, antiviral therapies for HCV have recently become available, but these have had little impact on development of HCC and it is virtually unknown how the virus causes cancer. Our group has been studying the effects of HCV on the host cellular enzyme telomerase, which is a reverse transcriptase (RT) that repairs short chromosomal DNA 3' ?telomeric? ends in dividing cells. Adequate telomere lengths must be maintained to avoid chromosomal injury and to support continuous cellular replication. Consequently, telomerase is induced or upregulated in the majority of malignant cells and has proven to be a valuable cellular target enzyme for cancer detection and anticancer therapy. Our laboratory has recently shown that HCV induces telomerase early after infection and we hypothesize that this behavior contributes to the virus' oncogenicity. Induction of telomerase is likely facilitated in part through the actions of HCV proteins core, NS5A and NS3-4A in the host hepatocyte. We have also demonstrated that HCV core and NS5A proteins transcriptionally activate TERT promoter and that NS3-4A, the viral protease-helicase complex, binds specifically to TERT and stimulates telomerase catalytic activity. Our data are the first to show that HCV can induce TERT expression as well as catalytically activate host telomerase. The overlying hypothesis of this application is that HCV reactivates telomerase through initial interactions with the Wnt/?-catenin signaling system which then drives TERT promoter to open transcription. This is likely accomplished by core and NS5A which have been shown to stabilize activated Wnt/?-catenin signaling complexes. We also hypothesize that NS3-4A, a multifunctional protease-helicase, increases telomerase catalytic activity by optimizing the enzyme's type II processivity. By increasing telomerase processivity, NS3-4A thus promotes efficiency of telomere repair and facilitates neoplastic progression. Collectively, the actions of the virus upregulate chromosomal maintenance and repair mechanisms and promote hepatocarcinogenesis. The long term goals of our work are two-fold: we wish to determine the mechanisms of how the virus induces telomerase expression and increases telomerase catalytic activity. Achievement of both of these goals will lead to the identification of cellular events that are undoubtedly important for HCC development and ultimately treatment. This approach is highly relevant for understanding how HCV promotes liver cancer and the data will lay a firm foundation for eventual drug targeting of telomerase or the viral helicase with anticancer agents."

"9366262","PROJECT SUMMARY The vast majority of perinatal hepatitis B (HB) infections become chronic infections, causing cirrhosis and liver cancer in adulthood. More than 250 million people (about 6% of the world's population) are chronically infected with HB virus (HBV), causing nearly 780,000 deaths each year. Universal HB immunization, starting with a birth dose of vaccine, is not sufficient to prevent all mother-to-child transmission, especially when mothers have high viral loads. In such cases, administration of HB immune globulin (HBIg) is recommended in addition to vaccine. In three studies, including a randomized clinical trial (iTAP) conducted by our group in Thailand, no transmissions occurred when mothers received an anti-HBV antiviral treatment at the end of pregnancy and early postpartum period. Maternal antiviral treatment decreases viral loads to those levels seen in mothers who seldom transmit the virus. In these studies, the antiviral treatment was safe and well tolerated by the mothers and infants. We hypothesize that HBIg can be replaced by maternal antiviral treatment for infants vaccinated at birth. Our primary objective is to demonstrate that, when mothers with high viremia who receive antiviral prophylaxis and when the newborn does not receive HBIg, the risk of HBV transmission to infants is less than 2%, the lowest rate of transmission ever reported without antiviral. This is relevant to public health given that HBIg is not widely available and most infants born to HBV infected mothers do not receive it and that HBIg plus vaccine administered at birth cannot prevent all infections, especially those already established in utero. This innovative strategy has never been tested in a carefully controlled setting. We propose a multicenter, open-label, single arm, prospective clinical study in infants born to mothers with high viremia (HBe antigen positive) who receive the antiviral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) from 28-30 weeks gestation until 2 months postpartum, while infants receive active immunization but no HBIg. The study will be conducted in Thailand and Laos PDR and will enroll 439 women and their infants in 32 sites of our clinical research network. HBsAg positive women will be enrolled if they have an HBeAg positive test (a widely available test of high virus replication). Mothers will be followed until one year postpartum and infants 18 months. The primary endpoint will be the detection of HBsAg confirmed by PCR detection of HBV DNA at six months of life. Demonstrating that antiviral treatment plus vaccine is sufficient to prevent virtually all perinatal HBV transmissions without the use of HBIg would revolutionize HBV PMTCT. The results of the study will help define policy to manage HBV infected pregnant women with an HBeAg positive test to prevent perinatal transmission."
"9422712","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine repeat region in the Huntingtin protein. A paradox of Huntington's Disease is that mutant Huntingtin protein is ubiquitously expressed, but only a subset of central neurons are killed in this disease. That is, some cell types are able to tolerate mutant Huntingtin (mHtt) expression without significant toxicity. The proposed studies are designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which cells process and remove aggregated mHtt, allowing them to survive. It is generally accepted that misfolded proteins are first held by small heat shock proteins to be refolded, and directed to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) if they cannot be refolded. When the UPS system is overwhelmed, misfolded proteins are then believed to be retargeted to large protein aggregates (inclusion bodies). However, in this model the role of small fibrillar aggregates, which are now widely believed to be the toxic species of aggregate, is unclear. Previous imaging studies have overwhelmingly focused on inclusion bodies, partly because imaging technologies that could detect small aggregates were not widely available. Using S. cerevisiae, we are able to see both small aggregates and inclusions in the same cell. One model to explain how cells tolerate large amounts of misfolded mHtt would be that small aggregates, produced when the UPS is overwhelmed, join inclusion bodies that are then degraded by autophagy. The proposed studies are designed to test this model. While attention has shifted recently to small aggregate species as the likely cause of most cellular damage, imaging studies of SAS are uncommon. Our first goal is to use advanced imaging and analysis to track small aggregates with respect to the inclusion body, proteasome, and phagocytic compartments, using a genetically tractable system. Second, there is evidence to indicate that the conserved small heat shock protein Hsp42p facilitates mHtt aggregate removal. It has been suggestubiuthat the mammalian sHSP HspB8 acts with Hsp70, BAG3 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) in promoting autophagy of inclusion bodies. Our second aim is to test the hypothesis that Hsp42p directs inclusion bodies to autophagosomes, a novel function for small heat shock proteins. This work will allow us to define the dynamic behavior of small aggregate species, and develop new techniques to examine inclusion body recycling, using methods that can be used to identify specific molecular deficits in strains known to modulate mHtt processing. Critically, this pilot project will facilitate the development of the PI through mentorship and will support the establishment of an active lab that promotes research training and scientific collaboration."
"9414027","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iron is an essential element but is toxic in excess. The concentration of free iron within cells is determined by regulated transmembrane iron import and storage. Malregulation of iron transport results in tissue injury, either from iron deprivation or overload. We propose to identify and characterize genes and proteins that affect the storage of iron in the yeast vacuole and in mammalian lysosomes and determine the mechanisms of high iron toxicity. We will continue our approach of using yeast genetics to identify genes involved in iron metabolism. We have shown that high iron induces a response that up-regulates the expression of the vacuole iron importer Ccc1, which protects yeast cells from iron toxicity. This transcriptional response is regulated by the iron sensitive transcription factor Yap5. We have discovered that transcription of CCC1 is increased by low glucose and iron in a Yap5-independent manner. We will identify the molecules responsible for the Yap5-independent induction of CCC1 and how low glucose affects iron storage. Yeast and mammals also export iron from the vacuole and lysosomes during iron limitation. We will determine if the yeast vacuolar iron exporters, Fet5/Fth1 and Smf3, are regulated post-translationally. Using stringent genetic selection systems, we will identify structural features on transporters that define metal specificity. Vertebrates store iron in ferritin and stored iron can be released from ferritin. Ferrtin can be degraded in the cytosol or in lysosomes, which are the equivalent of yeast vacuoles. We will determine how iron is exported from lysosomes. Iron is stored in ferritin as Fe3+ and must be reduced to Fe2+ to be exported by transporters. We will identify the mechanism of iron reduction and if there is a pool of lysosomal Fe2+. We will determine the role of putative lysosomal iron exporters and if those exporters are regulated at the level of localization, protein stability or activity. Our studies in yeast suggest that iron toxicity can occur both in the presene and absence of oxygen. We will determine the mechanism of oxygen independent iron toxicity. We identified two unique metabolites whose levels increase under conditions of iron toxicity. Through the use of metabolic profiling, we identified two unique metabolites that are only generated by toxic concentrations of iron. We will test the hypothesis that these metabolites are generated by an enzyme that is either mismetallated or altered by high iron. We will also determine if iron-dependent alteration of mitochondrial DNA is a prerequisite for oxygen-dependent iron toxicity. We have shown that alteration of citrate levels exacerbates iron toxicity in yeast. We will determine if alteration of citrate levels affects mammalian iron toxicity."
"9420642","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction hypothesis is one of the leading postulates for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SCZ) and is supported by numerous pharmacologic, behavioral and genetic studies. Nevertheless, we have little insight into specific alterations in NMDAR signaling and its mechanistic basis in SCZ patients. This is a critical knowledge gap, which has impeded further development of this hypothesis and limited our efforts to identify specific therapeutic interventions. (Preliminary Data) As direct evidence for altered NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling, we found decreased NMDA/Glycine induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR subunit 2 (GluN2) and reduced downstream signaling in the postmortem dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of SCZ cases. These changes are not associated with decreased NMDARs but with reduced activity of a cascade of kinases- Src kinase, protein kinase C and Pyk2- which in concert decrease GluN2 tyrosine phosphorylation. We found multiple molecular alterations in the DLPFC of SCZ cases; increased PSD-95, increased erbB4 activity, decreased dysbindin -1 and RPTPa, each of which can induce Src hypoactivity. (Hypotheses) We hypothesize that hypoactivity of Src in the NMDAR complex (Src-NR) reduces GluN tyrosine phosphorylation and is caused by altered protein interactions in a network of Src-NR-associated proteins ( the Src-NR interactome), which can be leveraged to modify behavioral phenotypes of NMDAR hypoactivity. (Approach) We propose a human-rodent translation strategy, by which we analyze disease related alterations in postmortem brains and examine their underlying mechanisms in rodent studies. Aim 1 will further examine postmortem brains of an elderly and mid-life SCZ cohorts to identify molecular alterations in the Src-NR interactome in SCZ, Aim 2 will determine the role of protein interactions in Src-NR hypoactivity and test rescue strategies in ex vivo preparations of rodent and human postmortem tissues and Aim 3 will determine SCZ related behavior and EEG phenotypes of Src-/- mice and test if Src enhancement can rescue such phenotypes in vivo."
"9241325","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza virus causes annual epidemics and periodic pandemics, resulting in the loss of millions of human lives, and is recognized as an important public heath priority of the U.S. Due to the high mutation rate of influenza virus, widespread resistance to anti-viral drugs targeting viral proteins and vaccines constitutes a major challenge for therapeutic intervention. Because all viruses utilize host factors and machinery to complete their life cycle, targeting host factors that regulate virus replication may provide a solution to mutagenesis- associated viral escape. However, relatively less is known about the host factors that are involved in mediating influenza virus replication compared to viral proteins. Therefore, the long-term goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms of host factors that regulate influenza virus replication and develop anti- viral drugs targeting these host factors. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that control the expression of the majority of genes at the post-transcriptional level and are implicated in diverse biological processes and diseases, including viral infections. Our understanding of the role of host cellular microRNAs in influenza virus replication is very limited. The overall objective of the current application is to investigae the functional role of the host miR-193b in influenza virus replication. We will test the hypothesi that miR-193b attenuates influenza virus replication by inhibiting LEF1-mediated Wnt/?-catenin signaling. Aim I will delineate the mechanisms of miR-193b-mediated repression of influenza virus replication. Aim II will evaluate the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of miR-193b against influenza virus infection. We expect to establish a previously unrecognized role for miR- 193b-mediated regulation of the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway in influenza virus replication."
"9418598","Gram-negative bacteria utilize extracellular fibers called chaperone-usher pathway (CUP) pili to mediate adhesion to host and environmental surfaces, facilitate invasion into host tissues, and promote interaction with other bacteria to form biofilms. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) use a CUP adhesion protein (lectin) called FimH on the type 1 pilus to bind to mannosylated glycoproteins on bladder epithelial cells to mediate the onset and progression of urinary tract infections (UTIs). This binding event initiates bacterial invasion and formation of intracellular bacterial  communities (IBCs) in the eukaryotic cell. Using rational drug design, mannoside antagonists of FimH have been developed as orally bioavailable therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of UTIs. Acute infection can either  self-resolve or develop into chronic cystitis, which is characterized by: i) persistent, high titer bacteriuria and  bacterial bladder burdens at sacrifice >4 weeks post- infection; ii) chronic inflammation and urothelial necrosis; iii) lymphonodular hyperplasia in the bladder submucosa and; iv) urothelial hyperplasia with a lack of uroplakin expression, which is a marker for terminal differentiation in superficial facet cells. Similar histological findings have been observed in humans suffering persistent bacteriuria and recurrent UTI. FmlH, the tip-associated  adhesin of Fml/F9/Yde pili (previously denoted FmlD) functions in UPEC pathogenesis by providing a fitness advantage during chronic cystitis. FmlH specifically binds to Gal(?1-3)GalNac epitopes which appear as part of  a remodeled glycan/galactose profile of the mouse bladder during chronic cystitis. FmlH is also upregulated in urines directly isolated from patients with UTI compared to expression during in vitro growth in media or normal  urine, suggesting a host-specific induction. In this proposal, innovative strategies will be taken to rationally  develop ?Gal and ?GalNAc ligands as antagonists of FmlH, alone or in combination with FimH inhibitors, as new preclinical therapeutics for treatment of acute and chronic cystitis. Using an X-ray structure of FmlH and virtual screening, new FmlH ligands, including O-nitrophenyl-?-galactoside (ONPG) were identified.  Subsequently, the X-ray structures of Gal?-1-3-GalNAc (TF) and ONPG bound to FmlH were used to design  improved FmlH ligands, with binding affinities several times higher than ONPG, as determined by an ELISA  binding assay. This structure-based design strategy will be used to optimize new ligands with higher affinity and good drug-like properties. This project's aims will be accomplished by integrating: i) X-ray structure-based drug design with medicinal chemistry (Aim 1); ii) biochemical screening, functional cell and tissue binding assays  Aim 2) and; rigorous pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation and pharmacodynamic (PD) efficacy testing of the most promising FmlH ligands, in murine animal models of chronic cystitis, urosepsis/kidney infection, and GIT colonization (Aim 3). The overall goal is to develop preclinical candidate FmlH antagonists as standalone anti-virulence therapeutics and/or as combination therapy with existing FimH antagonists for the treatment and prevention of UTIs."
"9394781","PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) jointly propose the creation of a University of Texas Adult Clinical Center (UTACC) for the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC). We will integrate resources and combine our expertise to provide a state-of-the-art center for comprehensive studies on physical activity in adults. The Specific Aims of the UTACC are: 1) To participate in the planning of the multi-center trial; 2) To enroll 450 participants in the acute and chronic exercise training studies, conduct physiological assessments, and collect biospecimens (muscle, adipose, and blood); and 3) To analyze and interpret outcome data and disseminate findings to the scientific community. We will use innovative tools to maximize participant retention and enhance fidelity and adherence to the exercise training protocols. The UTACC will have a significant impact on the MoTrPAC ? and advance the field of exercise science ? based on our strengths, feasibility of the proposed study, and expected outcomes: The strengths of the UTACC include our long-track record of performing human studies on molecular transducers of exercise; shared resources and years of networking through the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center network and the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium; and our success with enrolling understudied populations such as older individuals and Hispanics-Latinos. The feasibility for the UTACC is high due to our experience with clinical trials on physical activity; our substantial expertise in collecting muscle and adipose biopsies in humans undergoing exercise studies; and our access to outstanding clinical research facilities in which to conduct human research in a safe environment. Expected outcomes of this program include the determination of baseline molecular signatures associated with metabolic health and physical performance; the integration of multi-omic data for the elucidation of molecular networks that control metabolic responses to exercise and how they influence physical performance; and discovery of novel mediators (proteins, metabolites, miRNAs) of the beneficial effects of exercise."
"9417204","PROJECT SUMMARY ? CORE C Core C, which supports every project within the Program, provides access to sophisticated imaging technologies and histopathology services, enabling Program investigators to use imaging to obtain insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms and to track tumor progression, therapy response, and metastasis. Imaging in cells and animals ? from the molecular, to tissue, to whole-body level ? is supported by the Core. Core C will assist with sub-cellular to whole-tissue level analysis of fixed cells and tissues, providing histopathological services through a subcontract with a world-class pathologist. The Core also supports live cell imaging in three and four dimensions (3D and 4D, also known as 3D time-lapse), and imaging in live animals. The imaging approaches offered by Core C include several cutting-edge imaging technologies, each of which is available in a limited number of locations worldwide. These include i) super-resolution (100 nm), and high-speed cellular imaging achieved with an OMX (Optical Microscope eXperimental) microscope; ii) 3D whole-tissue reconstruction of tumors and metastases using light-sheet microscopy; and iii) intravital (live animal) imaging using custom-built spinning disk confocal and multi-photon microscopes. During the upcoming period of requested support, Core C proposes to support Program investigators through four aims. First, the program will provide assistance with histology, immune labeling, and histopathology. Second, the Core will support live cell imaging and super-resolution imaging. Third, the Core will assist with imaging at the tissue level, either using 3D tissue reconstruction or live imaging in animals. These technologies each require custom-built microscopes that are not generally available. Fourth, to provide Program investigators with tools to track tumor growth and metastasis, Core C will assist with whole animal imaging approaches, including bioluminescence, fluorescent proteins, and small animal ultrasound. Core C will also assist with the use of advanced imaging software, including Image J (NIH), Imaris (Bitplane), and Volocity (Perkin-Elmer). New in this renewal is support for quantification of micrometastasis, intravital imaging through surgically implanted windows, and 3D tissue reconstruction using light-sheet microscopy. Together, Core C has an unprecedented imaging platform, covering super-resolution imaging, 3D tissue reconstruction, live cell tracking in tissues and whole animal imaging. A Core that enables program investigators access to these technologies is essential as most of the imaging technologies supported by the Core are highly sophisticated and require very specialized training. Furthermore, access to the instruments required for these imaging technologies would be cost-prohibitive without the support of a Core. Thus, Core C will provide critical tools for Program members and, through the development of new imaging approaches, ultimately the broader cancer research community."
"9393087","Background: Benzodiazepine (BZD) use is a significant and persistent concern among older Veterans given the association of BZDs with adverse outcomes including falls, fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, increased risk of dementia, and mortality. In FY2015, over 82,000 Veterans ?75 years of age were prescribed a BZD despite abundant evidence of harms from both acute and chronic use and recommendations from professional organizations to limit use. Beginning in FY2013, the VA's Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative (PDSI) began monitoring a variety of psychotropic quality measures, including BZD use among Veterans ?75 years of age (hereafter referred to as ?BZD?75?). Among the 52 facilities (out of 140) that selected BZD?75 as a priority, each developed its own local strategy to improve prescribing. In order for the VA to build upon local successes at addressing the seemingly intractable problem of BZD prescribing, the aim of this proposal is to understand the combinations of local facility strategies and context that generate these outcomes. In addition, it is critical to understand the patient experience of these strategies, as Veterans may experience some ?successful? strategies as extremely distressful. This work may directly influence the clinical care of Veterans and is of both great interest and immediate relevance to our operational partners, including PDSI, Pharmacy Benefits Management, and the Academic Detailing Service. Objectives: Aim 1: Identify high- and low-performing facilities on acute and chronic BZD prescribing among facilities that prioritized the BZD?75 measure. Aim 2: Assess facility-level strategies and associated barriers and facilitators to addressing the BZD?75 goal along with the acceptability of those strategies to older Veterans. Aim 3: Identify and pilot test context-sensitive strategies for facilities to successfully reduce both acute and chronic BZD use among older Veterans. Methods: We will use interrupted time-series analyses of national VA administrative data to examine BZD prescribing across BZD?75 priority facilities (n=52). We will specifically measure change in: (1) rate of acute use (new BZD initiation) and (2) intensity of chronic use (average daily dose [mg/day]). As an exploratory sub- aim, we will measure the rate of fall-related injury by facility to determine whether change in BZD prescribing is associated with change in associated adverse outcomes. In Aim 2a we will conduct semi-structured telephone interviews with up to 16 PDSI local facility champions and additional staff from top- and bottom-performing facilities (identified in Aim 1), followed by on-site, semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders at up to 6 sites. We will gather information on facility-level strategies, barriers, and facilitators that may help or hinder facility efforts. Finally, we will conduct telephone interviews with older Veterans prescribed chronic BZDs that attempted a taper to learn whether patients experienced these facility strategies as distressful. An expert panel of clinicians, researchers, and administrators will review the strategies, local context, associated BZD prescribing outcomes, and patient acceptability to develop a toolkit of context-sensitive best practices facilities can implement to address BZD use, which we will then pilot test."
"9611162","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food insecurity, defined as difficulty affording an adequate diet owing to cost, affects over 20% of the 29 million Americans with diabetes. Food insecurity is an important socioeconomic barrier to effective diabetes care: it is associated with worse diabetes control and increased emergency department visits and hospitalization. By incentivizing consumption of calorie-dense foods high in simple carbohydrates and saturated fats, instead of more expensive fresh produce and whole grains, food insecurity may undermine healthy diets that are crucial for diabetes management. This project will help advance our knowledge of the relationship between food insecurity and diabetes by identifying how food insecurity affects current diabetes management and examining the clinical effects of using different strategies to overcome it. Fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms underlying potential interventions remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To determine the impact of food insecurity on a lifestyle change intervention: the REAL HEALTH Diabetes trial (R18 DK102737 NCT02320253), a pragmatic adaptation of the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention to community health centers, 2)To estimate the effect of nutrition assistance program use on diabetes control for patients in a primary care network, and 3) To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility of home-delivered medically tailored meals for food insecure diabetes patients with hyperglycemia. This research program complements the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' strategic focus on translating clinical research to practice by overcoming barriers faced by patients in real-world settings, reducing disparities in special populations, making care more patient-centered, and innovating within systems of care. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in understanding how socioeconomic barriers affect diabetes management and pragmatic interventions to overcome them. Career development activities include training in advanced analytic methods and intervention design through formal coursework as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will fill important knowledge gaps, and help improve diabetes management and reduce diabetes complications in patients with food insecurity."
"9444808","Sepsis causes more deaths in U.S. hospitals annually than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined. Elderly patients are a particularly high-risk group, with an incidence rate of ~60% of all septic cases. The elderly are also extremely vulnerable to the consequences of sepsis, showing 100-fold higher mortality than younger patients. Some of these deaths occur acutely after sepsis, but ~70% of these patients survive the initial infection, and succumb to opportunistic infections during the chronic phase of sepsis. The chronic stage of sepsis is important and is characterized by immunosuppression, but little is known about the mechanisms of sepsis-induced immunosuppression. CD4 T cells, essential for coordinating immune responses to a range of pathogens, are severely depleted during the acute stage of sepsis, and gradually recover throughout the immunosuppressive phase of sepsis. Our recent publication included data showing certain Ag-specific CD4 T cell populations do not recover, despite quantitative restoration of total CD4 T cells. We suspect that the prolonged loss of Ag-specific CD4 T cells introduces ?gaps? within the T cell repertoire leading to overall decreased adaptive immune system function. Among the immunological settings where CD4 T cell function is vital, this proposal will define the mechanisms responsible for the impairment of CD4 T cell-dependent B cell responses using the CLP model followed by secondary immunization or heterologous pathogen infection. Accordingly, our central hypothesis holds that alterations in the number and function of both follicular helper CD4 T (Tfh) cells and B cells after sublethal CLP-induced sepsis is responsible for suppressed humoral immunity and reduced protection against pathogens encountered within the context of localized or systemic secondary infections. The following specific aims will test our hypothesis: Aim 1) Define the sepsis-induced defects in Ag-specific CD4 T cells and B cells that restrict the generation of a productive CD4 T cell-dependent B cell response; Aim 2) Investigate the ability of therapies designed to restore DC or B cell number and function to revitalize humoral immunity after sepsis; and Aim 3) Determine the impact of sepsis on the maintenance and function of pre- existing memory CD4 T cells and B cells. Ultimately, this proposal will increase our understanding of why septic patients are more susceptible to secondary infections. Our use of the CLP model of polymicrobial sepsis, our ability to identify and study the function of endogenous Ag-specific CD4 T cells and B cells, and our experience measuring the adaptive immune response to infectious pathogens put us in the perfect position to define the mechanism(s) driving sepsis-induced suppression of CD4 T cell-dependent B cell immunity."
"9605989","DESCRIPTION: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are key components of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapies (HAART) for the treatment of HIV-infected patients. All FDA-approved anti-HIV NRTIs lack a 3'-OH, and therefore inhibit DNA polymerization by HIV RT through immediate chain termination. The absence of a 3'-OH also imparts detrimental properties to these NRTIs by reducing their binding affinity for RT compared to the natural dNTP substrates and reducing intracellular conversion to active NRTI triphosphates.  We have reported during the first funding cycle that 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) is a nucleoside analog that retains the 3'-OH moiety and demonstrates exceptional antiviral properties (EC50 = 50 pM in PBMCs) and a remarkable selectivity index (>200,000). EFdA's potency and selectivity index is by orders of magnitude more favorable than all currently-approved anti-HIV drugs. Despite the presence of a 3'-OH, the incorporated EFdA-monophosphate acts primarily as an immediate chain terminator because RT has difficulty translocating on the primer possessing 3'-terminal EFdA-MP, which is a unique mechanism of action. Therefore, EFdA-TP is a Translocation-Defective RT inhibitor (TDRTI). Additionally, EFdA has also been shown to efficiently inhibit clinically-important NRTI-resistant HIV strains, and demonstrating hypersusceptibility to the tenofovir-resistant K65R HIV. Notably, in our study of SIV-infected macaques the animals that had suppressed viral loads upon treatment with EFdA carried the M184V mutation, suggesting that M184V can be effectively suppressed by EFdA. We have also shown that EFdA has a remarkably high barrier for HIV resistance, and many EFdA-resistant HIV strains have reduced replication capacity. More recently we have shown that the combination of EFdA with Rilpivirine shows a synergistic effect, which would be useful in the design of new therapeutic regimens.  We will build on our work from the first funding cycle to understand the potency of EFdA at the RT and cellular levels, development of EFdA resistance, and EFdA combinations with currently-approved anti-HIV drugs. We will also use biochemical and structural approaches to characterize the inhibition mechanism of EFdA at the RT level, the activation of EFdA by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and deamination by adenosine deaminase (ADA).  This study will provide information that will guide the design of novel NRTIs and EFdA combination therapies with other approved anti-HIV drugs that may lead to a breakthrough in the treatment of HIV infection."
"9650401","Background: VA performance monitoring makes extensive use of diagnosis-based quality measures that track delivery of care only among patients who have qualifying ICD-9 diagnosis codes. Diagnosis-based measures can be calculated using existing VA data, allowing for low-cost, near real-time performance monitoring. However, diagnosis-based measures can have critical validity problems if the targeted condition is under- or over-diagnosed to differing degrees across facilities. When variation is diagnosing and coding occurs, facility rankings on measured performance can be misleading: High performing facilities can score poorly, low performing facilities can score well, and facilities with the same real performance can fall at opposite ends of the facility rank distribution. Use of diagnosis-based process measures can therefore undermine one of the primary purposes of quality measurement: The comparison of facilities and systems. In addition, diagnosis- based measures cannot be used to detect gaps in access to care for patients who have a targeted condition but no qualifying diagnosis code. Finally, when diagnosis rates vary across patient subgroups, diagnosis-based measures cannot be used to detect and act on healthcare disparities. Problems with diagnosis-based measures could be remedied if true prevalence data were available: Comparisons of performance based on diagnosis- versus prevalence-based measures would detect facilities with anomalous diagnosis rates and distinguish variation in true performance from variation in case-finding. However, for many conditions, the electronic health record (EHR) does not contain data on true prevalence. Objectives: The goal of the proposed project is to develop a general method for improving diagnosis-based measures when valid prevalence data are not readily available. We propose to build a model for predicting prevalence using multiple sources of existing data and to validate it through a one-time collection of gold standard outcome data (survey-based SUD prevalence). Leveraging existing data with targeted collection of model development and validation data is a cost-effective strategy to improve diagnosis-based measures without requiring ongoing, expensive disease surveillance. Focusing on substance use disorder (SUD) care as an example, the objectives of this study are to: (a) assess the degree of SUD under- or over-diagnosis by comparing the proportion of patients with coded SUD diagnoses in the VA administrative data to SUD prevalence estimates obtained using a validated measure in a patient survey conducted at 30 VA healthcare systems; (b) refine and validate a model for predicting SUD prevalence among VA patients using multiple existing data sources; and (c) assess disparities in SUD diagnosis by comparing diagnosis rates to survey- based SUD prevalence estimates across patient age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups. Methods: We will collect data on DSM-IV and DSM-5-concordant SUD among VA patients using a validated instrument. We will conduct telephone interviews with patients at 30 VA healthcare systems selected based on geographic region and expected differences between observed SUD diagnosis and true SUD prevalence. We will compare observed diagnosis rates to survey-based prevalence estimates. We will refine a prototype SUD prediction model using as inputs population SUD surveillance data for Veterans from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, EHR data from VA Corporate Data Warehouse, and organizational survey data from the VA Drug and Alcohol Program Survey. The model will be developed and validated using survey-based SUD prevalence as the outcome. We will fit the model using traditional methods and more modern machine learning algorithms and will select a final model based on established criteria for predictive validity. We will compute facility performance rankings using diagnosis rates versus predicted prevalence to assess the extent to which variation in performance may reflect variation in diagnosis or coding. Finally, we will assess possible disparities in diagnosing by comparing the gap between diagnosis and estimated prevalence across patient groups."
"9414605","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, analysis is often limited to a single tissue or performed using subjective scoring systems. We propose advanced three-dimensional MRI methods as well as advanced analysis tools to quantitatively study the spatial and temporal progression of OA across different tissues in the knee joint. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in multiple tissues of the entire joint over time. This project aims to develop 3D imaging tools based on MRI to sensitively track changes of OA in all joint tissues simultaneously. Our specific aims are to (1 develop a robust ultra-short echo time based quantitative DESS method to obtain high-resolution 3D maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2 and T2* in multiple joint tissues, (2) Improve the signal and resolution of whole-joint sodium MRI at 3T using a novel phased array coil, (3) Develop and validate novel 3D analysis tools that will allow us to quantify changes in knee joint tissues spatially and over time and (4) Validate the ability of our protocol and analysis tools to quantitatively detect changes over time in the knees of subjects with OA of the knee. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging and analysis techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue integrity in cartilage, meniscus, synovium, and bone marrow. This novel data acquisition will be paired with an innovative three-dimensional analysis approach that will allow quantitative assessment of multiple joint tissues at a single time point and over time. The significance of this work is that e will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes of OA over time with accurate registration of multiple joint tissues. This will lead to new insights into OA pathogenesis and progression, as we will be able to relate changes in adjacent joint tissues and across time in subjects with OA."
"9417013","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon the momentum of California's State University, Long Beach's historical commitment to training a diverse community of biomedical and behavioral research scientists. It utilizes best practices from the University's successful MSD, MBRS, COR, MARC, and RISE programs, the growing literature on the development of scientists from underrepresented (UR) and underserved communities, and a university wide self-assessment to design a program of activities. The goals of this CSULB RISE Program are to: 1) increase the number of underrepresented students (URS) completing degree studies in biomedical and behavioral science fields; 2) establish a research training curriculum that provides the skills needed by biomedical and behavioral researchers; 3) create an environment in which participants leave the program fully steeped in the culture and ethical practice of biomedical and behavioral research professionals; 4) increase the number of URS who successfully complete doctoral programs in biomedical and behavioral science fields. To accomplish these goals, the proposed RISE program will include eight major types of activities collectively designed to attract students from underserved communities and help support and strengthen their identity as scientists, and to provide a progressively rigorous educational environment that promotes critical, analytical, quantitative, creative thinking, and research skills that prepare participants to successfully compete in Ph.D. programs in biomedical and behavioral fields: (1) outreach to recruit underrepresented students into biomedical and behavioral sciences research and into the RISE program and other student development programs; (2) training and support to enable lower division students to enter into directed research, leading to independent research and entry into PhD study; (3) hands-on career exploration by students throughout their undergraduate program that focuses on biomedical and behavioral career opportunities and pathways; (4) a series of courses and workshops designed to train participants as ethical scientists, develop key academic and workforce skills, and prepare participants to successfully enter graduate study; (5) intensive laboratory research experiences under the mentorship of biomedical and behavioral faculty research faculty members; (6) biomedical-related shadow and research fellowship experiences on campus and at regional doctoral- granting institutions; (7) mentoring of matriculated RISE Fellows in their first two years after leaving CSULB as they transition to successful PhD studies, and (8) an on-going learning community which facilitates knowledge and professional growth and exchange between current and former RISE participants."
"9450665","Regulation of epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) expression in the kidney is critical to the maintenance of extracellular Na+ and volume homeostasis. This in turn plays an important role in blood pressure control, as illustrated by the observation that ENaC mutations cause inherited forms of hypertension (Liddle's syndrome) and hypotension (PHA type 1). The overall goal of our proposal is to elucidate signaling mechanisms and trafficking pathways that regulate ENaC. Building on our work in the previous funding period, we will focus on a novel signaling pathway that regulates ENaC trafficking under conditions of hyperglycemia. Previous work indicates that in diabetes mellitus, renal Na+ absorption in the distal nephron is enhanced, and ENaC abundance is increased. This may serve to counter Na+ and volume wasting induced by hyperglycemia. Moreover, there is a critical link between diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Hypertension is two-fold more common in diabetics than in the general population and it dramatically increases the risk for cardiovascular complications. Previous work suggests a causative role for excessive renal Na+ reabsorption in the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated hypertension. However, the underlying mechanisms linking diabetes and hypertension, as well as the mechanisms to explain enhanced ENaC abundance, have not been identified. In this proposal, we will address this critical gap in our knowledge. In preliminary studies, we found that ENaC current was increased by exposure of collecting duct epithelia to elevated glucose concentrations within the range found in patients with diabetes mellitus. Glucose increased current by increasing ENaC abundance at the cell surface. Additional preliminary data support a role for an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4-2, in this regulation. Based on these findings, we propose an overall hypothesis that hyperglycemia increases renal Na+ absorption by altering Nedd4-2- regulated trafficking of ENaC. We propose three specific aims to test this model. This work has the potential to define a mechanistic link between diabetes and the disrupted volume homeostasis that underlies hypertension, and on our understanding of how they are interrelated."
"9644454","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background/Rationale:  People with serious mental illness (SMI) die, on average, many years prematurely, with rates of premature mortality 2 to 3 times greater than the general population. Over 60% of premature deaths in this population are due to natural causes, especially poorly treated cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious diseases. Although the VA is a centrally organized, comprehensive healthcare system, veterans with SMI still have difficulty navigating the system, and are at substantially elevated risk for premature death. Too often, they do not attend scheduled appointments or fail to engage in primary care treatment, and consequently do not get valuable preventive and primary care services.  Primary care in VA has undergone significant transformation under the Patent Aligned Care Team (PACT) model, which is based on the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) concept. PACT has the goal of improving the quality, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of primary care. But it remains unclear how PACT will impact the large populations of veterans who get the majority of their care in specialty settings, such as people with SMI. Research can inform efforts to apply the PACT model in specialty settings. For example, while people with SMI do poorly with usual primary care arrangements, there is now substantial evidence that integrated care and medical care management approaches can improve medical treatment and outcomes, and reduce treatment costs, in people with SMI. Objective:  Using available evidence, we propose to implement and evaluate a specialized PACT model that meets the needs of individuals with SMI (SMI-PACT). Methods:  This project will partner with leadership at one medical center to implement SMI-PACT, with the goal of improving healthcare and outcomes among people with SMI, while reducing unnecessary use of emergency and hospital services. Evidence-based quality improvement strategies will be used to reorganize processes of care. In a site-level controlled trial, this project will evaluate the effect, relative to usual care, of SMI-PACT implementation on (a) provision of appropriate preventive and medical treatments; (b) patient health-related quality of life and satisfaction with care; and (c) medical and mental health treatment utilization and costs. The project includes a mixed methods formative evaluation of usual care and SMI-PACT implementation to strengthen the intervention, and assess barriers and facilitators to its implementation. Mixed methods will also be used to investigate the relationships between organizational context, intervention factors, and patient and provider outcomes; and identify patient factors related to successful patient outcomes. Significance:  This project's approach to SMI-PACT is consistent with the VA PACT model, and with efforts in VA to improve care for veterans with psychiatric disorders. This will be one of the first projects to systematically implement and evaluate the PCMH and PACT concepts beyond primary care. Should SMI-PACT be demonstrated to be feasible and effective, the model could be used more broadly to improve the quality and efficiency of care for veterans with serious mental illness. Findings regarding PACT in specialty mental health may also inform efforts to improve care in other specialty healthcare settings."
"9452325","Brain ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury due to stroke and cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, affecting thousands of Veterans every year. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying brain IR injury are still not completely understood. The objective of this proposal is to study a novel hypothesis that brain IR leads to a cascade of events resulting in inactivation of N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), massive buildup of damaged late endosomes (LEs), fatal release of cathepsin B (CTSB), induction of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), and delayed neuronal death.  NSF is the sole ATPase controlling membrane trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the endosome- lysosome system. Our recent studies show that NSF ATPase is progressively trapped as inactive aggregates within hippocampal CA1 neurons destined to undergo delayed neuronal death after brain IR. Our electron microscopic (EM) studies further show massive accumulation of damaged Golgi, transport vesicles (Vs), and late endosomes (LEs) in the CA1 neurons. Consequently, CTSB is extensively released from damaged Golgi/Vs/LEs structures, followed by delayed neuronal death after brain IR. We therefore generated a neuron-specific NSF activity-deficient transgenic (tg) mouse line (replacement of NSF 329 glutamate with glutamine, i.e., E329Q). The most prominent pathological phenotypes of this E329Q tg mouse line are massive accumulation of damaged Golgi/Vs/LEs, and release of CTSB, followed by delayed neuronal death. These phenotypes are virtually identical to those observed in hippocampal CA1 neurons destined to undergo delayed neuronal death after brain IR. Based on these new discoveries, we propose to test a novel hypothesis strongly supported by preliminary studies, i.e., brain IR leads to a cascade of events of NSF inactivation, massive buildup of Golgi/Vs/LEs, release of CTSB, induction of MOMP, and delayed neuronal death. We will use the E329Q tg mouse line, CTSB knockout (KO) mice, and cutting-edge technologies to study these molecular events after brain IR.  Aim 1 will test the novel hypothesis that NSF inactivation results in fatal release of CTSB and delayed neuronal death after brain IR. We will use the E329Q tg mice without brain IR and wildtype (wt) littermates subjected to brain IR to test this novel hypothesis. Aim 2 will test the novel hypothesis that fatal release of CTSB leads to induction of MOMP after brain IR. We will use CTSB KO mice to test this novel hypothesis. This Aim is based on the finding that cytosolic release of CTSB induces MOMP, resulting in delayed neuronal death after brain IR. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the NSF inactivation-induced cascade of events is a common pathway responsible for delayed neuronal death after brain IR. The rationale for Aim 3 is that studies in Aims 1 and 2 focus on the role of NSF inactivation in the hippocampal CA1 neurons after brain IR. A broader and perhaps even more important question is: is NSF inactivation commonly responsible for delayed neuronal death in all populations of hippocampal and neocortical neurons after brain IR? We will test this hypothesis by: (i) studying the damaging effects on the NSF-CTSB-MOMP pathway in ?ischemic resistant? CA3, DG and neocortical neurons after prolonged brain IR; (ii) examining whether CTSB KO can prevent delayed neuronal death in ?ischemic resistant? neurons after prolonged brain IR; and (iii) investigating whether the increased vulnerability in ?ischemic resistant? neurons in E329Q tg mice is due to the weakening of the NSF active store, resulting in CTSB release and induction of MOMP after brain IR. These studies will provide insights into the novel mechanism underlying brain IR injury and identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of brain IR injury."

"9418077","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Damage to the genetic material of our cells can have many undesired consequences. It may lead to cell death, growth arrest, inappropriate growth or mutations. The outcomes of these on the organismal levels are failure of essential organ function or cancer. Rare human genetic diseases have enlightened us about how lack of DNA repair and thus persistence of DNA damage in our cells leads to these problems. Our laboratory studies two DNA repair diseases, Fanconi anemia (FA) and Karyomegalic Interstitial Nephritis (KIN). Patients with FA have developmental abnormalities including skeletal anomalies and bone marrow failure, which leaves them unable to produce enough red blood cells to carry oxygen, platelets to prevent bleeding or white blood cells to fight off infections. FA patients als have a very high predisposition to developing cancer including acute myelogenous anemia that occurs paradoxically in the setting of the bone marrow failure, head and neck cancers, and gynecologic cancers. KIN patients develop kidney failure and need dialysis and kidney transplantation. Although rare, these diseases can be used as powerful models for understanding how bone marrow and kidneys fail, and how cancer develops when the DNA is not repaired. We strive to understand the molecular underpinnings of these diseases, connections and differences between them. Even though the patients with the two diseases show different health problems, the cells from the patients lack the ability to repair a very particular type of DNA damage, interstrand crosslink, which links the two strands of DNA together precluding their separation. This kind of damage may be caused by environmental toxins, metabolites from cellular processes or by chemotherapy during cancer treatment. In this grant, we propose to concentrate our attention on the nucleases involved in processing of the interstrand crosslinks. We have identified SLX4 mutations in three patients with Fanconi anemia in the International Fanconi anemia registry. With our collaborators, we have described FAN1 mutations in KIN patients. In the first two aims we propose to use the patient cell lines to understand the pathogenesis of the two diseases. Using molecular approaches we want to understand the interaction of SLX4- bound nucleases as well as FAN1, their different requirements across cell cycle and across different DNA lesions and how they genetically interact with other DNA repair pathways in the cell. In the third aim, we will take a biochemical approach to understand these nucleases. Performing in vitro experiments, we want to study how they work on damaged DNA. Our goal is to have a detailed picture of how the cell deals with crosslinks in hopes of manipulating the repair pathways for therapeutic applications."
"9338120","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of the proposed research is to learn what controls whether injuries heal with scarring/fibrosis versus full regeneration of los structures. The human health burden of fibrosis and scarring is enormous and affects every tissue from heart (lost heart function after a myocardial infarction) to lung (idiopathic lung fibrosis). Enhancing regeneration could prevent for example the almost universal recurrence of chronic wounds in the exact location where they previously appeared. We use the Wound Induced Hair Neogenesis (WIHN) model system where in the center of excisional wounds in mice a variable amount of regeneration occurs and de novo hair follicles form in a recapitulation of embryogenesis. The goal of this grant is to understand the factors which control the frequency of regeneration. We will directly test the mechanism and the ability for candidate molecules which enhance regeneration in mice to do so in human subjects. The results of this grant promise to help define new treatments and diagnostics to enhance regeneration and wound healing."
"9501395","Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ? 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program."

ANAs target a wide array of nuclear macromolecules and can mediate disease by the formation of immune complexes that deposit in the tissue to promote inflammation and damage; these complexes can also stimulate the production of cytokines including type 1 interferon to drive generalized immune system disturbances. Among ANAs forming immune complexes, antibodies to DNA (anti-DNA) are the serological hallmark of SLE and markers of diagnosis and prognosis. These antibodies bind to both single and double stranded DNA and form immune complexes that deposit in the tissue, especially the kidney, to promote inflammation; in addition, these immune complexes can stimulate the production of cytokines by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, triggering internal sensors of DNA. While the properties of anti-DNA antibodies have been extensively studied, much less is known about the origin of antigenic DNA, its access to the immune system and its unique molecular properties. In general, the source of this DNA has been considered to be nuclear in origin and the product of dead and dying cells. Our studies have provided a new perspective on this issue by demonstrating two important features of extracellular DNA: 1) its existence in the form of microparticles and 2) the presence in these particles of mitochondrial (mt) as well as nuclear DNA (nDNA). This presence of mtDNA is important since mtDNA is intrinsically immunostimulatory because of structural features that differ from those of nDNA. These involve CpG motifs in mtDNA, a consequence of the origin of mitochondria from bacteria, and oxidation of guanosine residues. Furthermore, we have shown that mitochondria released from cells have properties similar to those of microparticles, suggesting that mitochondria may serve as self-antigens in lupus, contributing to immune activities attributed to microparticles and providing a nidus for immune complex formation. Building on preliminary work, the proposed studies will focus on three main hypotheses: 1) DNA autoantigen can be released from cells undergoing various death forms and exist in both a free and particle form; 2) the metabolism of DNA during cell death influences the amount in the blood, its size and its representation in particle or soluble form; and 3) anti-DNA antibodies can bind to various antigenic forms of DNA, both free and particulate, with assay of antibodies to these forms providing more informative biomarkers. We will pursue three specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To determine the extracellular release of cellular DNA during different forms of in vitro cell death. We will induce different forms of cell death in cell lines in vitro and determine the representation of mtDNA and nDNA in soluble and particulate forms; Specific Aim 2. To use in vivo models to elucidate the release of DNA into the blood. We will use in vivo systems in the mouse to explore the release of mtDNA and nDNA following cell death; we will also sequence DNA in the blood by high throughput techniques; and Specific Aim 3: Using blood from patients with lupus and murine models, we will determine the presence and specificity of antibodies to various sources of extracellular DNA in SLE. To develop new serological approaches, we will determine the presence and specificity of antibodies to different antigenic forms of DNA, both free and particulate and, by assessing results from a large panel of well characterized patients, develop new biomarkers. Successful completion of these experiments will provide new insights into the mechanisms of pathogenicity as well as provide new biomarkers for clinical and research purposes."

"9559820","Project Summary The project aims to develop an HIV nonhuman primate model in which the breadth of protection by HIV Env- based active or passive immunizations can be determined in a quantitative manner in a limited number of animals. This should greatly improve the applicability of NHP studies for optimization and selection of candidate HIV vaccines or monoclonal antibodies for clinical efficacy studies and thus help to accelerate HIV vaccine development. The number of animals needed to determine the breadth of protection will be minimized by i) reducing animal to animal variation through referencing to an internal challenge virus control, ii) limiting the efficacy measurement to a single round of replication, and iii) challenging each animal simultaneously with a panel of different challenge viruses. The SIV based challenge viruses use HIV-1 Env for entry into target cells during the first replication cycle, but then switch to SIV Env for all subsequent rounds of infection. A challenge virus that uses SIV Env during the first and all subsequent rounds is included as an internal control that is not affected by HIV Env antibodies. Genetic tagging and next generation sequencing allows to determine the ratios of the co-injected challenge viruses and the influence of HIV Env antibodies on these ratios. As a proof of concept, fifteen different genetic tags will be introduced into the challenge virus and explored for their affect on virus replication. Based on these tags, a panel of challenge viruses will be generated and characterized that use 12 HIV Envs derived from transmitted founder viruses of different clades and geographic areas together with the internal control virus. Determination of the ratio of the HIV Env challenge virus to the internal control virus will be determined in rhesus PBMC cultures. To demonstrate in vivo infectivity of the 12 different HIV Env challenge viruses, they will be co-inoculated with the internal control virus intrarectally into six rhesus macaques. Ten days after inoculation the ratio of each HIV Env challenge virus to the internal control virus will be determined in the blood and different lymphatic tissues. The variation in the ratios between different animals should allow to determine group sizes needed in subsequent challenge experiments after active or passive immunization."
"9452588","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Fish oil, a rich source of marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (MO3PUFAs), is the most popular natural product used by U.S. adults. Substantial data support the beneficial effect of MO3PUFAs on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention and treatment. However, the specific mechanisms through which MO3PUFAs influence CRC are not well understood. Increasing evidence supports a pivotal role of gut microbes in integrating dietary cues with host immunity and potentially mediating the anticancer effect of MO3PUFAs. Dietary fat composition is a major driver of the gut microbial community structure. Mice fed with a high-MO3PUFA diet demonstrate increased abundance of the gut bacteria that support the host immunoprotective system and improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera, and decreased abundance of the microbes that dampen antitumor immunity, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, which has been shown to promote CRC by generating a tumor-permissive microenvironment. Taken together with my recent findings that the anti-CRC effect of MO3PUFAs is related to the tumor immune microenvironment, these data aggregately support the hypothesis that MO3PUFAs modulate the gut microbial composition and function to shape the gut immune response and suppress CRC. To test this hypothesis, I will first leverage three large prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), to characterize the gut microbial signature associated with long-term high intake of MO3PUFAs and assess whether certain microbes mediate the protective effect of MO3PUFAs on CRC incidence and survival. To establish causality, I will then bridge the observations to the clinic through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in patients with prior adenoma by investigating the effect of MO3PUFA supplements on the gut microbiome, metabolome, and gene expression profiling in the colon. This innovative project will advance our understanding about the interplay between MO3PUFAs, gut microbiota, and host immunity in CRC. I am well suited to perform this research based on 1) my expertise in nutrition, epidemiology, quantitative methods, and biomarker research; 2) the exceptional multidisciplinary mentoring team comprised of leaders in their respective fields; and 3) the unparalleled research environment to support my career development. Through this study, I will expand my expertise in several new areas, including the gut microbiome, bioinformatics, and design and conduct of biomarker-based RCT. The proposed research and training will help achieve my long- term career goal to become an independent investigator, and develop a transdisciplinary research program in the gut microbiome and human nutrition for cancer prevention through integration of population-based epidemiologic study with patient-oriented clinical investigation. The findings yielded from my research will uncover new biological mechanisms relating diet to carcinogenesis, and identify novel biomarkers or targets that can be effectively translated into the clinic to improve cancer prevention and treatment."
"9430388","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late onset disorder causing weakness of eyelid and pharyngeal, and proximal limb muscles. A major symptom of OPMD is swallowing difficulty (dysphagia) due to weakened pharyngeal muscles. Patients often experience choking or aspiration pneumonia, and may require a feeding tube in later stages of disease. At present, the exact molecular mechanisms of pathology are unknown. The only available options to treat dysphagia in OPMD patients are temporary, usually surgical procedures to decrease resistance in the throat to improve swallowing. Autosomal dominant OPMD patients harbor a mutation in the gene for the nuclear mRNA processing protein PABPN1, which causes the N-terminal polyalanine stretch of PABPN1 to expand from 10 to 11-18 residues. PABPN1 plays key roles in mRNA processing including polyadenylation of nuclear transcripts and the alternative polyadenylation and cleavage pathway. PABPN1 is expressed in all tissues, but mutation causes late-onset pathology only in a specific subset of skeletal muscles. How mutation of this ubiquitously expressed protein leads to late-onset pathology in specific tissues remains an open question. Skeletal muscle tissue is capable of regeneration. Closely associated with multinucleated, post-mitotic myofibers in adult muscles is a pool of stem cells known as satellite cells. Upon muscle damage, satellite cells become activated to proliferate, differentiate, and fuse with each other and existing myofibers. This process, known as myogenesis, restores muscle architecture and function. Interestingly, some of the muscles most severely affected by OPMD, including pharyngeal muscles, are more highly regenerative than other skeletal muscles. The hypothesis driving the work proposed here is that mutant PABPN1 disrupts mRNA biogenesis and decreases the myogenic capacity of pharyngeal satellite cells, leading to pathology due to the unusually high demand for myogenesis in pharyngeal muscles. We will take an integrative in vitro and in vivo approach using a novel mouse model that is the first to accurately copy the genotype of OPMD patients. This mouse model expresses mutant PABPN1 in all tissues. Because PABPN1 is known to impact mRNA metabolism, satellite cells from pharyngeal muscles will be isolated and assayed for RNA phenotypes (Aim 1). The myogenic program can be recapitulated in vitro and used to quantify specific stages of myogenesis. Therefore, primary activated satellite cells, known as myoblasts, from pharyngeal muscles will be isolated and used to quantify the effects of mutant PABPN1 on the specific stages of myogenesis in vitro (Aim 2). This model will then be used to assay the effect of mutant PABPN1 on myogenesis in pharyngeal muscle in vivo (Aim 3). The long-term objective of this work is to understand how mutant PABPN1 affects pharyngeal satellite cell biology and potentially identify targets for new pharmacologic OPMD treatments."
"9447074","The pathophysiology of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a rapidly progressive and deadly fibrotic lung disease remains poorly understood. Aging is a well-recognized risk factor for IPF, and IPF disproportionately affects the aging veteran population. Given this shift in demographic, it is critical to understand the contribution of aging to the cellular/molecular mechanism(s) leading to the pathogenesis of age-related diseases, such as IPF. In resolving fibrosis, lung myofibroblasts (the key `scar tissue generating' cell) undergo apoptosis to promote healing. In contrast, myofibroblasts from aged mice with non-resolving fibrosis acquire a senescent and apoptosis-resistant phenotype, mediated in part by persistent expression of NADPH- oxidase-4 (Nox4). Similarly, lung myofibroblasts from IPF patients exhibit senescence and apoptosis- resistance, associated with elevated Nox4 expression. However, the mechanisms that drive persistence of Nox4 and apoptosis-resistance of myofibroblasts in the context of aging/IPF remain unknown. We have identified a critical role for Nampt, a known regulator of innate immune responses and apoptosis, in driving the senescent and apoptosis-resistant myofibroblast phenotype in age-associated pathological lung fibrosis. We demonstrate that Nampt is upregulated in vivo in 2 injury models of age-dependent fibrosis, and in fibrotic regions of the IPF lung. Intracellular Nampt (iNampt) is persistently expressed in senescent and IPF fibroblasts, which fail to undergo apoptosis, and these cells secrete significantly elevated levels of extracellular Nampt (eNampt). We found that eNampt mediates profibrotic effects via TLR4, including myofibroblast differentiation, oxidative signaling, senescence, and apoptosis-resistance. Our data suggest that defective TGF-mediated downregulation of iNampt in senescent/IPF fibroblasts contributes to persistent iNampt expression, subsequent elevated eNampt levels, which promotes profibrotic effects. Reductions in Nampt expression facilitated myofibroblast apoptosis and led to protection from fibrosis in vivo. The mechanisms that drive continued propagation of fibrogenic responses, beyond initial injury, are not well understood. We propose a novel auto-regulatory mechanism (eNampt/iNampt), which temporally reinforces profibrotic responses in age-dependent pathological fibrosis. These studies will prvide insight into novel age-relevant mechanisms/cellular phenotypes in IPF pathogenesis. Further, we will evaluate the pre-clinical efficacy of FK-866 (iNampt inhibitor currently in phase II clinical trials as an anti-cancer agent) in rigorous aging animal models of fibrosis, enhancing the potential fo rapid clinical translation of novel therapeutics for IPF."
"9418074","ABSTRACT - PROJECT 1 One of the most common chronic diseases in the United States, asthma is a syndrome of airway inflammation and airflow obstruction. The presence of high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which produces NO and citrulline from arginine, and arginase, which converts arginine to ornithine and citrulline, suggest that asthma is a state of increased arginine catabolism. However, our prior work showed that arginine levels in asthma airway epithelium are 3-fold higher than in healthy airways. Little is known of arginine flux through iNOS and arginase pathways, the mechanisms that sustain arginine availability for these highly active pathways, or the consequences of increased arginine flux for asthma pathobiology. Here, preliminary studies reveal a cell-autonomous cycle for arginine synthesis, the citrulline-NO cycle, in which Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle intermediates shuttle nitrogen (N) to citrulline for the regeneration of arginine. We find that mitochondrial arginase 2 (ARG2) is higher in asthmatic airway epithelium as compared to controls, and does not compete with iNOS for arginine. Rather, ARG2 accelerates oxidative bioenergetic pathways, and suppresses levels of hypoxia inducible factors (HIF) that are mechanistically important in regulation of interleukin (IL)-13, a key cytokine in development of asthma. ARG2 blocks HIF accumulation, inhibits IL-13 production and prevents mucus metaplasia. Mice deficient in ARG2 have more IL-13 and mucus metaplasia in an allergen model of asthma, suggesting that arginine metabolism modulates cell physiology. Sub-classification of asthmatics by exhaled NO levels and genetic variants of ARG2, reveal arginine metabolic endotypes of asthma that quantitatively relate to subphenotypes of asthma. All this caused us to consider that arginine pathways may mechanistically modulate asthma inflammation in ways beyond the simple view of arginine as a source of NO. Thus, we propose to test the hypothesis that arginine flux through iNOS in the cytosol and ARG2 in the mitochondria regulates cell bioenergetics and HIF levels, and consequently modulates airway epithelial IL-13 production and mucus metaplasia. Working with Projects 2-4, we identify arginine metabolic pathways in the airways [Aim 1], determine if arginine flux acts as a checkpoint for aerobic metabolism and HIF accumulation [Aim 2], and regulates airway inflammation, mucus metaplasia and asthma severity [Aim 3]. Project 1 depends on interactions, expertise, and resources of the Program to test these hypotheses. Program Cores support murine models, technically complex assays, and shared clinical samples in order to facilitate translational and mechanistic experiments, not otherwise possible."
"9424072","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a fundamental gap in our knowledge to explain the intrinsic ability of centrioles to duplicate and function as microtubule-organizing centers. To fill this gap, we require a thorough molecular characterization of the very first steps in centriole assembly and pericentriolar material (PCM) recruitment; this deficit impedes our understanding of the etiology of centrosome-linked diseases. During mitosis, centriole function is activated and their duplication initiated by of the kinases, Polo and Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4), respectively. Normally, upon mitotic entry, cells contain two centrosomes, each containing a mother-daughter centriole pair that undergoes Polo-dependent `maturation', the process of recruiting additional PCM, allowing them to facilitate spindle assembly. As cells exit mitosis, each daughter cell inherits a centriole pair which has been modified by Plk4 to duplicate. Thus, Polo kinases control both the formation and duplication of functional centrosomes, and consequently, alterations in Polo kinase activity can dramatically influence spindle assembly and proper chromosome segregation. Our long-term goal is to better understand how cells couple cell cycle progression with centrosome function and duplication to ensure accurate distribution of the genome during division. The objective of this application is to understand how Polo and Plk4 are activated on mitotic centrioles to promote PCM recruitment and centriole duplication. Drawn from our preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that maturation and duplication are intrinsic behaviors of centrioles because Sas4, a centriole-surface protein, controls the activities of both master-regulators, Polo and Plk4. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the evolutionarily conserved fundamental mechanisms of centriole biology has the potential to translate into therapeutic strategies to address centriole-linked human disease. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Examine a mechanism of centrosome maturation whereby Sas4 activates Polo kinase to generate a mitotic platform for PCM recruitment; 2) Determine if Sas4 regulates Plk4 stability, and whether Sas4 phosphorylation by Plk4 controls the Plk4/Sas4 centriolar pattern to restrict daughter centriole assembly to a single site; and 3) Determine if phosphorylation of Asl and Sas4 by Plk4 induces formation of a daughter centriole initiation complex to recruit Ana2. The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it represents a new and substantive departure of the status quo by shifting focus to the role of the centriole surface protein, Sas4, as a key activator and substrate for both Polo and Plk4. The proposed research is significant because a thorough understanding of centriole biogenesis and function is intimately linked to our success in preventing/treating centriole-associated diseases (including ciliopathy, birth defects, neurodevelopmental disorders, and cancer)."
"9450375","There are limited effective treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in the GI tract like Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The treatments that are available can have toxic side-effects and part of the barrier to developing better alternatives is that mucosal immunity remains incompletely understood. During disease, there is a breakdown in the body's natural tolerance mechanisms and that allows inflammation to progress unopposed. There is a growing body of evidence that supports a role for regulatory T cells (Tregs) in suppressing these deleterious immune responses but these cells are not fully understood and the cellular dynamics have not been explored. In this application, we propose to use functional immunoimaging to study Tregs as they modulate inflammation in the intestine and explore the role of biotin and calcium in this process. There are several additional approaches to define phenotype and functional status of the tissue and cells being studied which will supplement the imaging findings. Notably, there are no published reports on studying Tregs in this manner during colitis. The experiments have been designed to use two mouse models for colitis, an adoptive-transfer model and a spontaneous model that develops with biotin deficiency. The experiments have also been developed in such a way as to facilitate translation to the clinic. We will use two-photon microscopy which allows for real-time imaging of lymphocytes interacting in live tissue to define the cellular immunoregulatory events that explain how Tregs function to suppress colitis. In the first aim of the proposal, our studies are focused on the mesenteric lymph node to look at induction and progression of immune responses hypothesizing that Tregs physically displace pathogenic T cells from Dendritic Cells. We will also perform experiments using an S1P1 agonist which is a pharmacological agent believed to prevents effector T cells from leaving the lymph node and which may work synergistically with Tregs to prevent pathogenic T cells from reaching the colon. A similar agent has already shown promising results in clinical trials for Ulcerative Colitis. In the second aim of the proposal, our studies focus on the intestinal wall where inflammation and tissue destruction create the disease symptoms. Again, we will be focused on the role of Tregs in this process. We have seen that biotin deficient mice develop spontaneous disease that completely resolves with biotin replacement which directly links biotin to intestinal inflammation. If biotin supplementation can be shown to be effective, it would represent a low cost treatment without side-effects. Finally, the third aim focuses on how Tregs modulate calcium signaling in effector T cells in both the mesenteric lymph node and the colon. Calcium signaling is necessary for T cells to develop an immunological synapse with Dendritic Cells for activation and pathogenesis. We believe that Tregs hijack this process to induce the release of effector T cells from Dendritic Cells preventing disease. Additionally, we will study the effects of a novel therapeutic agent called an Orai1 channel blocker. Orai1 has been identified as the calcium channel in this system and we believe its blockade will also be effective in modulating immune responses in the GI tract. Furthermore, Orai1 blockade seems to have no effect of Treg function and we will examine if it can be used to augment Treg-mediated suppression of inflammation in the mesenteric lymph node and the colon. We anticipate that these three independent, but interrelated aims will enhance our understanding of the mechanism of Tregs and how they affect inflammation in the GI tract. Furthermore, we hope that the studies on the pharmacologic agents mentioned will advance their implementation for clinical use and benefit the Veterans we serve."
"9541316","Project Summary/Abstract  Parallel processing is a common motif in neural sensory systems. In the mammalian olfactory bulb (MOB), odor information from the glomeruli is transmitted by the tufted and mitral cells (TCs and MCs) to different regions of the olfactory cortex, resulting in two parallel odor-processing pathways. The nature and functional significance of information processing performed by each pathway is not understood. Intrinsic cellular and network connectivity differences have been found between the two pathways, and stereotypical MOB gamma oscillation activity (gamma fingerprints) in local field potential recordings have been hypothesized to result from these differences. However, no explanation has been proposed that would mechanistically link the cellular and connectivity differences to the gamma fingerprints.  To make progress in understanding the nature of processing by these pathways, we propose a computational modeling approach that will build a rigorously validated, biophysically detailed network model of the MOB containing the TC and MC pathways. The model will be used to systematically manipulate the cellular and connectivity differences to establish their role in the formation of gamma fingerprints. Furthermore, the model will be used to investigate the differences in information processing by the TC and MC sub-systems, by simulating principal cell output and characterizing their differences. The model and the results of the manipulations will result in a mechanistic understanding of information processing by the TC/MC pathways.  In the first Specific Aim, published models of MOB cells will be validated against experimental data using the NeuronUnit framework developed in our lab for validating computational models, and models that best approximate experimental observations will be identified and extended. Membrane ion channel conductances and morphologies of TC and MC models then will be systematically manipulated to investigate their contributions to cell behaviors that support the formation of gamma fingerprints. In the second Specific Aim, validated cell models will be used to assemble a network model of the MOB. Lateral connectivity, synaptic properties, and inhibitory interneuron proportions will be systematically manipulated to investigate their contributions to the gamma fingerprints.  Under the mentorship of a computational neuroscientist Sponsor and with guidance from a Collaborator with expertise in olfaction research, the proposed project will form the basis of the Principal Investigator's graduate dissertation research. All models will be implemented in NEURON, shared using the modular, simulator-independent language NeuroML, which facilitates discovery, sharing, and reuse of models and their components by other researchers, and will be made available via online model sharing repositories."
"9451091","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a major form of liver cancer, is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Its prognosis is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. The national prevalence and mortality due to cirrhosis and HCC in VA health care users have been increased by 2.5 to 3-fold during the last decade. The predicted increasing trend of HCC incidence and HCC-related deaths in the US veterans group remains alarming. Chronic hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis, fatty liver, and exposure to hepatotoxins are the major risk factors for HCC development. The risk of HCC increases strikingly in HCV carriers with diabetes and obesity. Thus, HCC is a major cause of deaths and veterans? health issue. A single FDA-approved medical therapy for HCC, sorafenib only extends survival by approximately 3 months. Curative surgical options include hepatic resection and liver transplantation. However, very few patients are surgical candidates due to a late diagnosis of HCC. One of the major obstacles preventing the development of effective therapeutic agents is due to the potential existence of tumor stem cells (TSCs) in HCC. Most tumors contain a small percentage (1% to 2%) of TSC population that are believed to be responsible for resistance to chemotherapy, relapse, and metastasis. We have shown that a TSC-related protein, doublecortin- like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is induced in hepatotoxicity-induced liver injury, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC whereas a normal liver lacks DCLK1 expression. The elevated DCLK1 level promotes hepatoma cell migration, cell cycle progression, and HCC-like tumor growth. Our central hypothesis is that activation of DCLK1-expressing cells contributes to the development of hepatic neoplasia and, ultimately, HCC. Targeting the DCLK1-expressing subpopulation and DCLK1 regulated signaling will reduce the burden of cancer-related deaths. The proposed investigations rely on the use of primary human hepatocytes derived from normal and patient donors. We will determine the mechanism(s) which promote DCLK1-expressing human hepatocytes to acquire tumor characteristics. We will use cell culture and a unique mouse model with humanized/chimeric liver to test the hypothesis. We will also develop HCC patients-derived tumor xenografts to evaluate the impacts of targeting DCLK1 in HCC. Taken together, these studies will increase our understanding of the mechanism(s) that regulate hepatic neoplasia and will potentially validate DCLK1 as a new therapeutic target in HCC. These studies, if successful, will have a major impact on the field of cancer and veterans? health because DCLK1 also contributes to the tumor growth in pancreas, intestine, and colon. !"

Our Program primarily provides comprehensive management of patients from all five groups of the PH World Classification, and also has a long history of participation in industry-sponsored as well as NIH-sponsored multicenter clinical trials for PH treatment. Since right ventricular (RV) function is the main determinant of death in PH, we propose thorough phenotyping of PH patients with a primary focus on the complex relationship between the RV and the pulmonary vasculature (PV) and RV-PV uncoupling, with the goal to further examine their crucial impact on morbidity and mortality in PH. Leveraging our extensive clinical knowledge in PH and our expertise in molecular and diagnostic pulmonary medicine and cardiology, we propose to use 1) echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) to identify non-invasive measures of RV performance and their capacity to predict outcomes; 2) invasive hemodynamic assessment of RV/PV interaction for its impact on deep phenotyping and survival; and 3) molecular (genomics, genetics, and serum biomarkers) for endophenotyping. The search for clinical, hemodynamic, imaging, serum and genetic biomarkers proposed in this application can be readily applied to all clinical centers in the context of the PVDOMICs as relevant variables for disease risk assessment, dynamic phenotyping (baseline and in response to treatment), endophenotyping, and as intermediate or primary outcomes in clinical trials. In summary, while the choice of parameters, studies and target populations will be left to the discretion of the DCC, our PH clinical center will offer the unique expertise of a multidisciplinary and highly integrated team of experts in this new endeavor to redefine PH phenotypes from all five groups of PH, thus ensuring success of the PVDOMICs efforts."
"9442229","Project Summary Approximately one-third of adults in the United States have prehypertension which increases the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Early detection of prehypertension offers a window of opportunity to prevent progression to overt hypertension and CVD through behavioral modification. Sympathetic activation and arterial stiffness are both deleterious factors that concomitantly contribute to elevated blood pressure. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programs have been shown to reduce blood pressure in prehypertensive adults, but the mechanisms for the reduction remain speculative. We will systematically examine 24-hour blood pressure regulation and two potential mechanisms for the anti- hypertensive effects of MBSR by directly assessing muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and arterial stiffness. Aim 1 will determine if MBSR improves 24-hour blood pressure regulation, aim 2 will determine if MBSR reduces sympathetic neural activity, and aim 3 will determine if MBSR will decrease arterial stiffness in prehypertensive adults. This project will also provide advanced research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in health-related fields at Michigan Technological University, consistent with the goals of the Academic Research Enhancement Award (R15) mission. Our central hypothesis is that MBSR will: 1) improve nocturnal blood pressure dipping and / or reduce early-morning surges, 2) reduce resting MSNA and attenuate the neural cardiovascular responses to acute stress, and 3) decrease arterial stiffness. We will utilize a parallel, randomized, control design (MBSR vs. active control) that includes gold-standard techniques for measuring blood pressure (24-hour ambulatory assessment), MSNA (microneurography), and arterial stiffness (applanation tonometry). These studies will provide detailed insight how MBSR interventions influence neural and cardiovascular control in humans. Finally, this project would help to advance the potential for MBSR to be used for reducing the onset of hypertension and other cardiovascular risks, and findings from the proposed studies may help to direct future efficacy-related work."
"9393975","The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is designed to discover and characterize the range of molecular transducers (the `molecular map') that underlie the effects of physical activity (PA) in humans. We formed an interdisciplinary team with the requisite experiences to contribute significantly to the overall success of MoTrPAC. Our Exercise and Physical Activity Collaborative Team (ExPACT) ? an alliance of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Center for Exercise Medicine (UAB), Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes in Orlando, Florida (TRI-MD), and Ball State University Human Performance Laboratory (BSU) ? has extensive experience performing highly-controlled aerobic (AT) and resistance (RT) exercise training clinical trials in healthy and diseased populations. We have a lengthy history of maximizing human biospecimens (muscle, adipose, blood) to reveal molecular underpinnings linked to physiological and clinical outcomes of acute and chronic exercise stimuli. Moreover, the overarching goal of ExPACT is to contribute substantively to successful MoTrPAC planning, execution, and innovation. Phase I (Planning Year) Aim 1. We will effectively collaborate with MoTrPAC leaders and NIH leadership to help guide and finalize the structure and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Aim 2. Leveraging institutional resources committed to ExPACT and our previous experience, we propose to collect pilot biospecimens to facilitate the MoTrPAC Chemical Analysis Sites' ability to optimize analyses. Phase II (Recruitment and Testing Years 2-5) Aim 1. We will enroll 420 sedentary but healthy men and women 18+ y into a rigorously controlled, 12-wk, randomized trial of AT (n=185), RT (n=185), or no-exercise control (CON, n=50). ExPACT geography will enrich MoTrPAC racial, ethnic, urban, suburban, and rural diversity. The design incorporates comprehensive phenotyping to assess fitness and clinical outcomes, and human tissue phenotyping to link the molecular transducers with key biological responses to exercise. Aim 2. Pre- and post- training, we will obtain strategically timed biospecimens before and after acute exercise. To better understand the biological extremes, we will conduct the same acute response studies in highly-trained athletes (AT (n=20) or RT (n=20)). Serial biospecimen collection in CON will allow estimation of biological, seasonal, circadian and methodological variability. Aim 3. To enhance the overall scientific impact of MoTrPAC, we will seek additional funding to conduct innovative ancillary studies, which will markedly augment subject and tissue phenotyping and interpretation of the molecular maps. Phase III (Close-out Year 6) Aim 1. We will complete all ExPACT data entry, quality control, and central deposit procedures in collaboration with the MoTrPAC Coordinating Center, and we will actively contribute to the completion of biospecimen analyses, manuscript writing, and dissemination of results. We would be honored to collaborate with MoTrPAC to contribute future knowledge on the molecular mechanisms through which physical activity can improve or preserve health."
"9462114","Project Summary/Abstract The transfusion of platelets is a major component of the treatment of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplants, trauma patients, sepsis, and battlefield injuries. However, due to a complete reliance upon donors as the only current approved source of platelets, and the strict, short shelf-life and storage conditions of donor- derived platelets, current supplies are not sufficient to meet increased needs as the population ages and may not be readily available in remote locations. We propose to develop a process for manufacturing human platelets under strict FDA guidelines from non-donor sources so that they may be administered to patients in the clinic. Our initial development work will utilize umbilical cord blood as the initial stem cell source for platelet production with the goal of developing methods that can be translated to the use of induce pluripotent stem cells as a renewable cell source that does not require continual donations. We will screen the cells to isolate those most capable of producing the best and largest quantities of platelets while we develop methods that result in the efficient, cost-effective production of large supplies of platelets sufficient for transfusions, 3-5 x 1011. The production of platelets will include the development of a bioreactor system that meets FDA guidelines and requirements for safety, quality, identity, purity, and potency and is capable of producing at least one transfusable unit per disposable bioreactor while limiting the cost of the final product. To ensure the accurate production of a clinically- relevant platelet product, we will test the safety and function of the platelets in a validated animal model and subject our manufactured platelets to clinical platelet functional tests utilized for donor-derived platelet testing. Finally, we will examine the feasibility of different storage options for our manufactured platelet products as they will be slightly different in composition from donor-derived platelets and thereby may not require the storage restrictions set for donor- derived platelets. This could greatly advance both the ready supply and the ability to access platelets in remote locations. KIYATEC?s platelets will reduce morbidity and mortality in multiple patient populations who suffer from bleeding related to platelet quantity or quality defects, including patients with cancer, trauma, sepsis and battlefield injuries."
"9604631","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Executive functions, and in particular cognitive control functions, contribute to or are affected by numerous psychiatric and neurological conditions. Understanding how brain network dynamics support cognitive control function is crucial for clarifying the basis of resilience to injury and identifying opportunities for substantive advancements in intervention. While network science (e.g., graph theory) has led to enlightenment in the organization of the brain and basis of human cognition, elucidating translational implications requires an explicit focus. I propose to do so. I aim to apply recent innovations in dynamic network analysis (recent extensions of graph theory) and network control theory in neuroimaging data to examine the basis of cognitive control function in health and dysfunction in stroke. The program integrates approaches from cognitive neuroscience, network science, and control theory. The goal is to produce a theoretical advance in the use of noninvasive brain stimulation treatments for cognitive dysfunction. The specific aims for this project are to: 1) Quantify structural and dynamic brain network properties underlying cognitive control function in health and dysfunction following stroke 2) Use network control theory to intervene in brain networks that support cognitive control There are two main components of this project: (1) the analysis of network structure and function underlying adaptive cognitive control and (2) the use of network control theory applied to diffusion tractography data to (a) discriminate between network mechanisms of cognitive control and (b) facilitate cognitive control recovery in individuals that have suffered from stroke. This would provide a substantial advance in our knowledge of how cognitive control processes exert their influences across brain networks. While some research has begun to emerge in this area, I propose to use state of the art techniques within dynamic network analysis in conjunction with well-validated behavioral measures. This will serve as an important benchmark for work outside of the current application. It will also begin to characterize reference states underlying adaptive task performance that will be used to guide later control theory-based approaches to brain stimulation. Here, network control theory will be used to target noninvasive brain stimulation on an individual basis. This could lead to a substantive advance in our understanding of the variance in responsiveness to noninvasive brain stimulation and lead to a control theory based framework for intervention in cognitive control dysfunction. More broadly, the outcome this work will provide a step toward true integration between network neuroscience and systems engineering-based translation in neurological and psychiatric populations. These fields are developing rapidly, but an explicit focus on cognition and integration with the physical sciences will be required to conceptualize potent opportunities for intervention. This project offers the first opportunity to establish this intersection and promote a new interdisciplinary conversation between the fields represented."
"9414080","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Appropriate social behavior often demands self-control. Both neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, addiction) as well as disease states (e.g., HIV positivity, brain lesions) can lead to changes in the neural mechanisms involved in self-control - often with effects most strongly manifested in social contexts. Understanding how the brain identifies social contexts, evaluates potential outcomes, and guides selection of appropriate behavior would provide insight into these disorders and the development of new treatments. Recent work - including from our group - demonstrates that neural activity in temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) signals information relevant for identifying social context, that these social signals influence valuation processes in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral striatum (VS), and that social value signals inform reward comparison processes in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Yet, this now-standard model for social decision making leaves unanswered key questions about brain function and dysfunction, especially how social contexts can potentiate maladaptive decision making observed in disorders. We propose and empirically test a novel two-stage neural circuit model of social decisions. The first stage involves identification of a social context, which we hypothesize relies on computations in TPJ that shape subsequent valuation and decision processes elsewhere. In a second stage, control processes shape ongoing behavior toward social goals (e.g., maximizing the acquisition of information about others, shaping interpersonal reputations), which we refer to as social control. We propose to evaluate this model using an integrated set of experiments conducted in humans and monkeys. We will use similar tasks that manipulate the nature and quality of social contexts (e.g., cooperative or competitive) for decision making, involve both social and non-social reward outcomes, and provide complementary information from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans, neurophysiological recordings in monkeys, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in both species (including simultaneous neural recordings in monkeys)."
"9405932","Abstract Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in adolescence. To improve our ability to predict and prevent suicidal behavior, there is a pressing need for research in this area to advance beyond identifying risk factors toward a greater focus on the mechanisms of risk for this behavior. In particular, elucidating the neural pathways underlying risk for suicidal behavior is important insofar as such work may yield specific and modifiable targets for clinical intervention. The adoption of new experimental paradigms providing experimental control over potentially modifiable risk factors has been recommended as a means of meaningfully advancing the field in this regard. Although yet to be applied to the study of suicidality, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), in conjunction with measures of electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs), may hold promise as an experimental paradigm in the study of potentially modifiable risk factors, and underlying neural mechanisms, for suicidality. One such risk factor of particular relevance to suicide in adolescence is state-sensitive aspects of impulsivity. Impulsivity has been consistently linked with suicidality, with this association appearing to be stronger in adolescence than adulthood. As a first step toward investigating whether modulation of impulsivity and associated neural pathways may yield clinically meaningful changes in risk for adolescent suicidal behavior, the proposed R21 is a proof-of-concept study evaluating the potential for tDCS targeting brain regions associated with behavioral impulsivity (right inferior frontal gyrus [rIFG]) and cognitive impulsivity (left orbitofrontal cortex [lOFC]) to modulate these facets of impulsivity in a sample of adolescent suicide attempters. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive anodal tDCS over the rIFG, anodal tDCS over the lOFC, or a sham stimulation condition, in a three-group design. Task-based measures of behavioral and cognitive impulsivity will be administered before and after tDCS or sham stimulation. Additionally, EEG and ERP data will be collected during the impulsivity tasks, and resting-state EEG data will be collected pre- and post-tDCS administration to confirm engagement of the targeted brain regions and to delineating the neural pathways underlying the effects of tDCS on impulsivity. This study is relevant to the research objective, of clarifying the neural circuitry profiles related to suicide risk, outlined by the NIH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention in their recent research agenda for suicide prevention. It is also consistent with NIMH?s Strategic Plan, which emphasizes the need for research on biomarkers and behavioral indicators of psychopathology, and for research utilizing neurobehavioral methodologies."
"9418075","ABSTRACT - PROJECT 2 During the previous award cycle, we identified mechanisms by which primary airway epithelial cells (AECs) synthesize heavy chain (HC) modified hyaluronan (HA) apical rafts, and airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) synthesize an extracellular matrix of HA cables, which are leukocyte-adhesive or what we have also termed as pathologic-HA. Our studies in the Program revealed the importance of this pathologic-HA matrix in the genesis of inflammation, airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness of asthma. Within the airway, there is constant interaction between the closely coupled ASMCs and overlying epithelium, and increasing data indicate a primary role for epithelium and smooth muscle in the origins of inflammation through production of early mediators. In this continuation of Project 2, we propose to investigate if airway epithelial production of NO and cytokines promotes the accumulation of a pathologic-HA matrix by the smooth muscle in asthma. In preliminary data, we show that the airway epithelium responds to prototypic Th2 cytokines or cytokine mixes with the production of HA and induction of iNOS. Utilizing our novel co-culture system, we show that the ASMCs can respond to epithelial derived NO with the production of leukocyte-adhesive HA cables. We also show that the major contributor to HA production is via the hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2). Collaborative studies of NO regulation and signaling mechanisms, which are investigated by other members of this Program, support our experiments to define mechanisms of pathological HA formation, including NO metabolism (Project 1), specific protein thiol nitrosylation (Project 3), and NO activation pathways (Project 4). Thus, in this continuation, we propose to test the hypothesis that NO and HCs produced by the asthmatic airway epithelium promote formation of a pathologic, leukocyte-adhesive HC-HA matrix by ASMCs, through mechanisms that appear to be sGC-independent NO recognition pathways. To test this hypothesis, we plan to identify pathways leading to airway epithelial cell production of HA [Aim 1]. We also plan to identify pathways of ASMC production of a leukocyte-adhesive HA matrix [Aim 2]. Finally, we will determine the contribution of NO and HA on the development of inflammation, AHR, and remodeling in vivo [Aim 3]. Project 2 depends on the collaborative interactions and complementary skills, expertise, and resources of the Program to test hypotheses. Program Cores support novel murine models, technically challenging assays, and shared clinical samples in order to facilitate translational and mechanistic experiments in Project 2 not otherwise possible."
"9414044","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under natural conditions, our visual experience is characterized by frequent eye movements as we scan a rich visual environment. Most experiments, however, have focused on neural responses under visually and behaviorally impoverished conditions, sacrificing realistic conditions for tractability. There is a growing realization that the brain's activity under these conditions does not always generalize to more natural settings, and experiments that probe neuronal dynamics under more complicated situations are needed. The long-term goal of this application is to determine how neural circuits in the primate brain act to generate coherent visual perception despite frequent eye movements and changes in internal cognitive state. The frontal eye field (FEF), a part of prefrontal cortex critical for controlling saccadic eye movements, plays a key role in this function through its unique position in the cortical hierarchy. FEF neurons serve both visual and motor functions, with connections to subcortical structures that control the eyes and to visual cortical areas. How do FEF neurons act in this gateway, serving the dual functions of integrating visual information to guide eye movements and informing the visual system about planned motor commands? One clue comes from studies of the phenomenon of predictive remapping, in which neurons shift their spatial preferences prior to an impending saccade. This occurs in FEF neurons as well as other cortical areas, and hints at the frequent and dynamic changes in their response properties. What kinds of dynamic changes are brought on by motor planning? How does the information necessary to generate these dynamics propagate through neuronal circuits? We will address these questions in three specific aims, the first of which uses rapidly presented sparse noise stimuli, an approach developed in early visual areas, to probe the dynamics of FEF neuronal responses. We hypothesize that FEF neurons have precise temporal dynamics, enabling responses to rapidly flashed stimuli, and nonlinear spatial summation, leading to strong responses to small stimuli that are perceived as potential saccade targets. The second specific aim is to measure the predictively remapped response with high spatial and temporal precision using the same noise stimulus. We hypothesize that remapping manifests as a gradual shift in the receptive field in the peri-saccadic time period, and this occurs for both guided saccades and more naturalistic spontaneous saccades. In the third specific aim, we attempt to isolate the neuronal circuitry responsible for these dynamic changes by recording simultaneously from a population of FEF neurons. We hypothesize that local circuitry within FEF is invoked to transfer information between neurons prior to an eye movement. The overall result of this study will be to establish the role of FEF in integrating visual perception and motor control during active vision, and to construct a framework for using receptive field mapping and population recordings to measure dynamic changes in neural circuits across visual and motor systems. This will aid in developing treatments for neurological disorders of vision and rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury or disease."
"9450869","Project Summary/Abstract: Spinal cord injury (SCI) produces a permanent loss of function below the level of damage. In addition, more than 80% of SCI patients report the development of horribly debilitating neuropathic pain (NP) that further robs the individual of life quality. NP can be an almost constant pathological companion for these individuals and represents a significant cause of suicide in the chronic SCI population. Unfortunately, there are few therapeutic options available to treat NP with a low percentage of individuals reporting treatment efficacy. One possible explanation for the low number of effective treatment options is our poor understanding of the mechanisms that initiate and potentially maintain NP in chronic SCI. Inflammation represents one possible mechanism to elicit NP in the days to weeks following SCI. However, inflammation has previously been considered to be transient, with mechanisms maintaining chronic NP unclear. Our published research suggests, however, that inflammation can be detected long after the initial injury in a clinically-relevant model of rat SCI. We detect the presence of inflammatory metabolites of arachidonic acid, particularly prostaglandins and leukotrienes, produced by cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes, respectively. FDA-approved non-steroidal inflammatory (NSAIDs) drugs such as ibuprofen have been tried as analgesics for SCI-NP, but are ineffective. Our detection of elevated intraspinal prostaglandins AND leukotrienes suggests a possible explanation for the failure of ?over the counter? NSAIDs in treating NP. Studies have shown that the targeting of only one metabolic pathway, for instance, the cyclooxygenase pathway that generates prostaglandins, results in a ?shunting? of the arachidonic acid into the sister lipoxygenase pathway that produced leukotrienes; the end result being a net ?gain? of pro-inflammatory mediators (in this specific example, increased leukotrienes). We demonstrated that delayed treatment with a novel dual inhibitor of both cyclooxygenase AND 5-lipoxygenase enzymes successfully reduced NP in rats with chronic SCI. We subsequently demonstrated that this experimental drug reduced both prostaglandins and leukotrienes if administered in the acute phase of injury, resulting in significant locomotor recovery. Unfortunately, this drug is not FDA-approved. Our current goal is to test combinations of FDA- approved inhibitors of cyclooxygenase AND 5-lipoxygenase to determine: 1) if combinations of these two classes of inhibitors are as effective at treating or permanently blocking chronic NP as the previously tested experimental dual-inhibitory drug, and 2) whether such treatment resolves the chronic pro-inflammatory state as evidenced by reduced prostaglandin and leukotriene biosynthesis. As the FDA-approval process can require decades to move a drug from bench to bedside, the effective translation of already-FDA-approved drugs to new tasks, such as the treatment of neuropathic pain could significantly reduce time needed for subsequent clinical evaluation and use. Targeting prostaglandin AND leukotriene production to treat chronic NP with FDA-approved inhibitors would represent a novel therapeutic approach and would represent a critical advancement in care for the chronic SCI community."
"9451197","The toxic side effects of many commonly used therapeutic agents can result in drug dose reduction or discontinuation, limiting the use of these effective and inexpensive agents in the clinic. Protecting against dose limiting toxicities would improve patient quality of life and has the potential to improve therapeutic outcomes by increasing compliance with treatment regimens and allowing increased treatment times and doses. With previous VA funding, we have been investigating mechanisms to decrease or eliminate the toxic side effects of cancer chemotherapy for two decades and have moved from basic research to Phase III clinical trials. Our research has demonstrated that delayed administration of the thiol chemoprotective agents sodium thiosulfate (STS) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an effective strategy to reduce the cochlear, renal and bone marrow toxicities of the platinum-based chemotherapy agents cisplatin and carboplatin without decreasing their anti- tumor efficacy. This proposal will expand our chemoprotection strategy to aminoglycoside antibiotics that are commonly used in the VA patient population for the treatment of serious infections. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that inflammation following activation of the innate immune response in the cochlea will enhance the ototoxic side effects of cisplatin chemotherapy and aminoglycoside antibiotics. To investigate the mechanisms underlying toxicity and chemoprotection, we will test novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using the iron oxide nanoparticle contrast agent ferumoxytol. Ferumoxytol is taken up by macrophages and activated microglial cells over the course of 24 hours, providing a non-invasive marker of inflamed tissues. We hypothesize that ferumoxytol enhancement on MRI will provide a quantifiable biomarker to measure inflammation in the cochlea and the impact of inflammation on ototoxic stimuli, as well as the impact of chemoprotection on these processes. In Aim 1 we will evaluate innate immune system enhancement of cisplatin ototoxicity using generalized systemic inflammation versus localized acute neuroinflammation. We will evaluate the magnitude of ototoxicity and inflammatory cell infiltration into the cochlea, and determine whether thiol chemoprotection blocks the enhanced cisplatin toxicity. We will investigate high-resolution MRI with ferumoxytol to assess inflammation and cisplatin ototoxicity and determine the impact of STS and NAC on these processes. In Aim 2 we will assess chemoprotection for endotoxemia-potentiated aminoglycoside ototoxicity. We will use ferumoxytol MRI to assess cochlear vessel permeability and inflammation. Our overall goals are to develop chemoprotection strategies against the side effects of therapeutics and imaging biomarkers to improve detection and management of inflammation, ultimately improving long-term outcomes for VA patients."
"9529995","Project Summary Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent professional antigen presenting cells of the immune system and serve as a bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses. When DCs are activated by a stimulus through toll- like receptors (TLRs), DCs undergo a process of maturation, defined by cytokine & chemokine secretion, co- stimulatory molecule expression, antigen processing and presentation, and the ability to activate T cells. DC maturation is coupled with an increase in energy demand, which is fulfilled by a TLR-driven burst in glycolytic metabolism. Up-regulation of glycolysis in activated DCs provides these cells with molecular building blocks and cellular energy required for DC effector function. Inhibition of glycolysis impairs both the survival and effector function of activated DCs. According to the prevailing model in the field of DC ?immunometabolism?, TLR-driven glycolysis in DCs is sustained primarily by increases in glucose uptake. While non-immune cells, specifically hepatocytes and muscle cells, can store glucose in the form of glycogen as an intracellular energy reserve, the role of glycogen metabolism in supporting DC immune responses has not been described. Our preliminary data show that DCs express enzymes essential for glycogen metabolism and that inhibition of glycogen metabolism significantly impairs key activation parameters of these cells. This indicates that glycogen metabolism in DCs may play an important role in supporting the effector function of DCs. This proposal aims to answer how glycogen metabolism regulates and supports the course of immune activation in DCs. We propose using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches in both human and mouse DC systems to test the hypothesis that glycogen metabolism is an essential component of DC energy homeostasis that is required for supporting effective immune functions of these cells. !"
"9619165","Abstract Adult stem cells regenerate tissue by dividing asymmetrically, producing both new stem cells and differentiating daughters. Spermatogonial stem cells provide a lifetime supply of sperm in organisms ranging from flies to man. Like all germline stem cells, they uniquely transmit the genome to future generations. Signals from specialized local microenvironments (or niches) regulate stem cells in general, but in most tissues niches are difficult to identify and manipulate in vivo. An exception is the Drosophila testis, which is a leading model for stem cell biology. In this tissue, local Janus-kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) signaling promotes stem cell renewal within a well-defined niche, while cells exiting the niche differentiate. In our prior work, characterization of STAT targets led us to discover that an individual stem cell can acquire a mutation that gives it a competitive advantage: as a result, that cell and its progeny can displace all of the neighboring (wild-type) stem cells from the niche over time. This phenomenon, called stem cell competition, has intriguing but unproven connections to human reproduction. Older fathers have a higher risk of having children with genetic defects such as dwarfism that are caused by rare, dominant activating mutations in signaling pathway components. Although the mutations are bad for the offspring, they are thought to be are selected for in aging men because they give individual spermatogonial stem cells a competitive advantage. Since stem cell competition has not been observed directly in mammals and is not understood mechanistically, in Aim 1 we characterize this process in depth using the Drosophila testis, which offers genetic approaches that surpass those available in mammals, and should inform the understanding of stem cell competition quite generally. In addition to controlling stem cell competition, niche signals also ensure that stem cells in the adult Drosophila testis maintain their ?male? identity. Sex maintenance, which is a type of stem cell transdifferentiation, occurs in mammals but is not well understood mechanistically. Therefore, in Aim 2 we combine genome-wide analysis of gene expression with genetic tools unique to Drosophila to learn how sex maintenance is regulated in vivo. This will advance the field of regenerative medicine and continue to expand our understanding of spermatogonial stem cells - the cornerstone of male reproduction."
"9418111","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this R35 proposal is to uncover novel genetic discoveries and biological mechanisms underlying association with devastating cardiovascular diseases. This proposal builds on strengths in high-throughput genetics and genomics and development and application of innovative computational and statistical methods and genomics technology to maximize the benefits of genetic studies of cardiovascular disease. We will continue our discovery efforts to uncover genetic variants associated with a variety of cardiovascular diseases including atrial fibrillation, aortic aneurysm and dissection, and myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. Building on our previous work where we identified a number of new genes for coronary artery disease and lipids, we also propose to uncover the mechanisms underlying association at known loci using genetics and epigenomics. We propose to assess the phenotypic impact of the ~19 million variants and 20k indels and SVs identified from whole genome sequenced samples by imputing them into 70,000 new GWAS samples with many cardiovascular phenotypes. We will perform integrated analyses with epigenomics data to highlight clusters of loci with related function. We also propose to perform targeted sequencing of 300 genes in 30,000 CAD cases and controls to search for loss of function variants at CAD loci that implicate CAD genes. We will continue to search for mechanistic insight by performing a PheWAS for all CAD-associated variants identified, disentangling multiple independent signals and correlated traits and clinical endpoints using conditional testing. Completion of these studies will provide new insights into disease mechanisms that have the potential to catalyze breakthroughs in cardiovascular disease prevention, treatment, and diagnosis."
"9470236","ABSTRACT Background: The progression of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) to metastasis is an inefficient process that involves coordinated interactions between tumor and its immune microenvironment. We have found that a CRC secreted peptide hormone, progastrin (PG), promotes CRC metastatic dissemination in an experimental mouse model. Preliminary studies demonstrate that PG has a novel immune regulatory effect characterized by increase systemic neutrophil accumulation and survival. PG's effect on neutrophils is indirect and requires production of GM-CSF by T-cells. Objective/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the immune regulatory effect of PG creates a permissive environment for metastasis. Hence, the main goal of this proposal is to understand PG's effect on the T-cells and neutrophils that promote CRC metastatic dissemination in mouse models and in human disease. Specific Aims:  1. To establish the effect of progastrin in colorectal carcinoma metastasis and on T-cell and neutrophils  2. To test the effect of progastrin on human immune cells and correlate progastrin expression in human  colorectal carcinoma and metastasis  3. Identify the T-cell subset that respond to progastrin and explore the underlying signaling mechanism  4. To characterize the effect of progastrin on neutrophil function in the colorectal carcinoma tumor microenvironment Method: We will perform loss of function studies to establish the role of PG in CRC metastasis and further investigate the role of T-cells in PG's effect on metastasis in vivo. We will measure the expression of PG in CRC and metastasis from patient samples and correlate the findings with clinical outcome. We will identify the T-cell subset(s) that produces GM-CSF and understand its signaling mechanism by genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches. We will characterize PG's effect on neutrophil functions and perform single-cell gene expression studies of intratumoral neutrophils from patient CRC samples. Cancer Relevance: Little is known about the how colorectal carcinoma regulates immunity to affect the dissemination of CRC metastasis. We have identified a novel immune regulatory function of PG in CRC metastasis and we aim to characterize its significance and mechanism, which may lead to new therapeutic or preventive approaches against metastatic dissemination."
"9418091","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This award will support the training and career development of a junior investigator in cardiovascular epidemiology and pharmacogenomics, with special emphasis on the role of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and preventive treatment. Despite significant strides in prevention and management, CVD remains a leading cause of death in the United States. Pharmacogenomics, the study of how an individual's genome affects their treatment response, has expanded our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of CVD. However, gene-drug interactions have been difficult to assess in epidemiologic and clinical studies, in part because of the extraordinarily large sample sizes required for genome-wide association studies of these interactions and lack of strong candidate genes. COMT, which encodes a key enzyme in degradation of catecholamines including epinephrine, norepinephrine and catechol estrogen, is a strong candidate gene with plausible physiological links to both CVD and drug metabolism. COMT rs4680 is a well-studied and extremely common genetic polymorphism which results in a 3-4 fold reduction in enzymatic activity. The COMT genetic variant encoding the low-activity form of the enzyme, was associated with increased CVD risk and higher levels of triglycerides, systolic blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c in the Women's (Genome) Health Study (N=23,294). Interestingly over the 10 years of the study, women homozygous for the COMT low-activity genotype randomized to aspirin treatment had lower rates of CVD. Conversely, COMT high-activity homozygous women randomized to aspirin had higher CVD rates compared to placebo. Given the widespread use of aspirin for prevention of CVD, and the high prevalence of COMT rs4680 genetic variants, it is imperative that we understand the generalizability, mechanism and impact of the COMT locus itself and drugs that may share common molecular pathways and networks with it. This translational research proposal addresses these gaps by: 1) an epidemiologic study of COMT association with incidence of subclinical and clinical CVD in a multi-ethnic cohort; 2) using large-scale gene-expression and pharmacogenomic data to elucidate COMT molecular pathways and interacting drugs, and 3) conducting clinical studies to examine effects of these drugs on ex-vivo and in-vivo platelet function. As an emerging genetic locus with pleiotropic CVD and drug interaction effects, COMT is an excellent model system to probe the multiple molecular pathways and networks involved in cardiovascular function, disease and treatment and thus guide the development of novel strategies to attenuate CVD risk, and a promising example in which to develop personal expertise in cardiovascular epidemiology, systems biology, clinical trials, and other key career development milestones.

"9650537","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare: Decision support, surveillance, and quality care initiatives have incredible potential to increase the health of veterans. The rich clinical data contained in the electronic health record enables development of these applications; however, much of that data is locked in free-text reports and remains inaccessible to computerized applications. Natural language processing (NLP) can be applied to provide structured output from free-text input. The VA has been at the forefront of developing NLP techniques within the VHA.  Background: A new generation of tools is needed to realize the vision of effective use and analysis of free-text clinical records for both improving care quality and informing clinical research. Clinical natural language  processing tools have been developed for classifying, extracting, and summarizing information from narrative  clinical texts, in support of diverse tasks including the identification of patients with nosocomial infections,  phenotype-genotype correlation, and selection of patient cohorts for research studies. The VA has been a leader in developing NLP capability, with the hope of implementing NLP in system-facing, patient-facing, and team-facing applications being developed in hi2 HMP and iEHR. Many NLP tools and components are already being developed and hosted on Veteran's Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) (Project 1).  Unfortunately, a large gap between development and clinical/research practice limits applicability-most  applications require customization of NLP tools to specific domains, NLP tasks often require the combination of  multiple (often incompatible) tools, and there is a need to integrate external displays to aid interpretation.  Advances in human-computer interaction and information visualization suggest approaches that can help overcome many of these limitations. A growing body of experience with interactive visualizations of clinical data provides multiple models of how abstracted information from clinical records might best be displayed to users, while extensive experience in fields such as end-user programming and user-centered design provides guidance on how some of the shortcomings in clinical NLP application might be addressed.  Objective: We envision a flexible, user-centered development environment that will provide VA clinicians and medical researchers with the ability to customize and configure NLP and visualization components with little or no NLP-specific expertise or custom software development. As shown in Figure 1, we will build upon a solid  foundation of successful VA NLP components (Project 1) developed largely by members of this CREATE team  to realize this goal, applying user-centered design and evaluation techniques to address the gap between  existing NLP technology and the needs of end users (providers and researchers in projects 3 and 4). The resulting development environment will allow non-NLP experts to customize, investigate, and apply NLP to clinical tasks and to develop visual interfaces that integrate and display EHR data.  Methods: Consistent with the entire INFORMED CREATE, our approach is a user-centered approach in which the data needs of users are considered in the context of their clinical workflow. Users for this project are researchers and providers in Projects 3 and 4 seeking to develop applications for extracting, analyzing, and displaying structured and unstructured data from the EHR. The development environment will be a general-purpose toolkit for researchers developing diverse types of displays for many different domains."
"9451840","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an evidence-based, cost-effective, and widely-available multidisciplinary program that combines supervised exercise with psychoeducation on health behavior change aimed at improving overall health and reducing cardiovascular risk in individuals with established CVD. Despite CR's ample attention to increasing physical activity (PA) and improving diet it produces almost no weight loss (WL). WL would significantly improve the CR patients' health, the majority of who present to CR with obesity. Gold standard in-person behavioral weight loss interventions (BWLs) produce clinically significant WL that improves health and disease risk/severity, but these programs are so burdensome and costly that they are impossible to conduct within existing CR programs. The primary mentor's fully automated 3-month online program, Rx Weight Loss (RxWL), produced clinically significant mean±SD WL of 5.8±4.4 % of initial body weight in physician-referred patients (N=154), 5.8 ±5.2 % in worksites (N=75), and 4.2±5.3 % in community settings (N=230); this was maintained at 6-months. Dr. Goldstein, the candidate, aims to conduct formative work to tailor RxWL for use in CR. She will then use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to rapidly screen 4 innovative eHealth/mHealth intervention components with the potential to improve WL in this special population when combined with the core RxWL program. Following pilot testing with n=20, a fully-powered 24 full factorial experiment with 160 patients (each randomized to receive 0-4 of the components) will be used to test the 4 novel intervention components: (a) a tailored interactive intervention to promote structured PA using a Fitbit; (b) a bite counting device to promote caloric restriction; (c) a Web-based virtual reality (VR) intervention for BWL skills implementation; and (d) virtual meetings to increase WL self-efficacy. By the 6-month follow-up, this design will allow the candidate to determine which components maximize WL and whether there are favorable component combinations. Dr. Goldstein will test which components are (or are not) effective and why or how they exert their effects, which is critical for understanding their mechanism of action (or inaction). Each component will be required to meet a 2% WL optimization criterion for inclusion in the final treatment package. This research will result in a fully- automated BWL treatment package optimized for CR, which will be submitted for testing in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in an R01 developed during the K23 grant period. Given the candidate's success while earning her PhD from Kent State University and completing an NHLBI-funded Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine T32 at The Miriam Hospital and Brown University, the candidate will undoubtedly leverage the resources in her exemplary research environment to develop into a successful, independent scientist. Through a robust training plan and innovative research project, Dr. Goldstein will become one of the only independent scientists to use eHealth/mHealth technology to facilitate WL in CVD, specifically CR, patients."

Both previous sleep GRCs scored in the highest-performing group among all GRCs held in their respective year, with >85% of respondents ranking the meetings as ?excellent? in all categories. Participation was outstanding (199 applications accepted for 2014, 233 for 2016), with 22% (2014) and 25% (2016) of attendees coming from Europe and Asia. Sleep GRCs contributed significantly to grow the next generation of sleep researchers: trainees were 30% of all attendees in 2014 and 40% in 2016. Sleep GRCs also strongly promoted diversity: women represented 44% (2014) and 49% (2016) of all attendees. We believe this success will continue in 2018. The Chair (Dr. Chiara Cirelli, U Wisconsin ? Madison), Vice-Chair (Dr. Paul Shaw, Washington U - St. Louis), and the Steering Committee of 12 eminent sleep researchers planned an outstanding program that spans the breath of the field and reaches out to outside experts, including the Keynote Speaker, Dr. Cristina Alberini (NYU) and Drs Matthew Colonnese (George Washington U) and Heiko Luhmann (U Mainz Germany). None of them has studied sleep per se, but their work on memory consolidation and on the maturation of brain activity soon after birth, when sleep is the predominant behavior, is highly relevant for many of us. The other 7 sessions will discuss the evolving roles of catecholamines in sleep/wake regulation, the cellular and systems? costs of wake for brain and body, the new paradoxes of REM sleep, the global and local determinants of sleep need, the consequences of enhancing/disrupting specific sleep rhythms, the metabolic and vascular effects of sleep disruption. These topics were specifically chosen because thought-provoking and, in line with the subtitle for the 2018 meeting, they are expected to trigger an intense debate on the ?How and Why? of sleep, with the goal of leading to new insights. In addition to including a GRS, the 2018 GRC program will strongly promote the training of young sleep researchers by including 8 early career scientists as GRC speakers or discussion leaders, and 7 trainees (graduate students and post-docs) as GRC speakers. Both Chair and Keynote speaker are women, and so are 38% of the speakers and 78% of the Discussion leaders (~33% for both in 2016). Sleep research is thriving, unraveling the specific mechanisms by which sleep benefits brain and body, from learning and memory to metabolic and cardiovascular function. We expect this meeting to be a crucial milestone that helps the field to move forward in an open-minded and innovative manner."
"9394752","Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with significant adverse health consequences including cardiovascular disease, motor vehicle accidents, daytime functional impairments and mortality risk. Although SDB is more common among men than women, it still impacts 17% of women in the general population. [Our preliminary evidence suggests it is even more common among women Veterans who receive VA care.] The recommended first-line therapy for most patients with SDB is positive airway pressure therapy (PAP). Published studies show that women have lower PAP adherence than men, particularly in the US, yet we are not aware of data comparing men and women Veterans. Because women Veterans experience significant sleep disturbance and other consequences of sleep disorders, adjusting to PAP therapy may be quite difficult. To date, studies have not tested interventions specifically designed to improve PAP adherence among women, accounting for important sleep-related and social factors.  Since 2010 we have been studying sleep disorders among women Veterans, initially focusing on insomnia disorder. Through this work we discovered that a significant segment of women served by VA also are high risk for sleep disordered breathing (SDB; also referred to as sleep apnea), particularly if they report poor sleep. In treating insomnia, we found that the initial discomfort created by traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (e.g. initial sleep restriction) is difficult for many women Veterans to tolerate. We developed and are now testing an insomnia intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), called ?Acceptance and the Behavioral Changes to Treat Insomnia? or ?ABC-I?. Within ACT, treatment focuses on a patient's values and reasons for implementing behavioral changes, and teaches the patient strategies for tolerating temporary discomfort in pursuit of goals consistent with one's values. We now propose to use these same therapeutic approach, adopted from ACT, to address unique challenges faced by women Veterans in adjusting to PAP therapy.  This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a program combining patient education with ACT-based techniques in improving adherence to PAP therapy, called ?ABC-SA? or ?Acceptance and the Behavioral Changes to treat Sleep Apnea.? This 6-session intervention will address initial discomfort, link treatment to the patient?s values and incorporate methods for accepting the changes that are required to treat SDB. Main study outcomes will be assessed 3 months after PAP initiation, and PAP adherence will be tracked remotely for 12 months. The 6-session ?control? intervention will account for the contact with a study interventionist and will be modeled after usual care.  The objectives of this proposal are: (1) to test the efficacy of the ABC-SA program in improving PAP adherence, compared to a control program modeled after usual care, for women Veterans with SDB; (2) to test the efficacy the ABC-SA program for improving objectively-measured and patient-reported sleep quality, compared to the control program; and (3), to test the efficacy the ABC-SA program for improving quality of life and symptoms of depression, compared to the control program. Data will be analyzed using ?intention to treat? principles, using appropriate statistical methods for clinical trials."
"9498082","PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer immunotherapy ? where the immune system is unleashed to destroy cancer cells ? is a revolutionary new approach for combating cancer. However, even though immunotherapy has achieved unprecedented efficacies in the clinic, many cancers are not yet amenable to immune therapy, and even for those that are, a majority of patients fail to respond. New agents with improved or complementary mechanisms of action are therefore needed. One intriguing, yet poorly understood potential cancer immunotherapy agent is the small molecule Val-boroPro. Val-boroPro induces immune-mediated tumor regressions in multiple mouse models of cancer by inducing pyroptosis, a lytic form of programmed cell death, in monocytes and macrophages. Notably, Val-boroPro was the first small molecule discovered that induces pyroptosis. It is now established that inhibition of the cytosolic serine peptidases DPP8 and DPP9 (DPP8/9) by VbP activates the pro-protein form of caspase-1 to mediate cell death, but how DPP8/9 inhibition leads to the activation of caspase-1 remains entirely unknown. The long-term goal of this project is to successfully harness this pathway for cancer immunotherapy. The objective of this proposal is to determine how the inhibition of DPP8/9 induces pyroptosis in monocytes and macrophages. The central hypothesis is that DPP8/9 cleave and inactivate one or more peptides, which, if not cleaved, activates the innate immune sensor protein Nlrp1. Activated Nlrp1 then activates pro-caspase-1, triggering pyroptosis. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory and described in the application. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine strain, species, and cell type sensitivity to DPP8/9 inhibitors, as Nlrp1 is highly polymorphic and varies considerably across strains and species; 2) determine the molecular mechanism of Nlrp1 activation by DPP8/9 inhibitors; and 3) determine the function of a specific co- chaperone required for DPP8/9 inhibitor-induced pyroptosis, which we hypothesize is responsible for the stability, folding, or trafficking of a key pyroptosis factor (e.g., Nlrp1 or the DPP8/9 substrate). Successful completion of this proposal will uncover new principles and mechanisms regulating the innate immune system, providing insights into pathogen recognition, autoimmune disorders, and inflammation. Moreover, this work has extraordinary potential to identify new targets and strategies that could form the bases of novel cancer immunotherapies."
"9572167","PROJECT SUMMARY Malaria remains a major global infectious disease, largely affecting people living in resource poor environments, and is one of the most important causes of childhood mortality. Drug-resistance is constantly undermining the usefulness of antimalarial regimens. There is an urgent need for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Plasmodium falciparum parasites utilize multiple ligand-receptor interactions for the invasion of human red blood cells, many of which are redundant. Different parasite strains rely on alternative ligand-interactions known as invasion pathways, for invasion, presumably for immune evasion and to invade polymorphic red blood cells. We have recently developed methods for the in vitro genetic analysis of red blood cell genes using hematopoietic stem cells. We have functionally characterized two red blood cell proteins, BSG and CD55, and have shown that they are essential for invasion by all P. falciparum strains, suggesting that they are strain- transcendent, prioritizing their interactions as targets for therapeutic development over strain-specific interactions. In forward genetic knockdown screens that assess all of membrane proteins found in the RBC proteome, we have identified a short list of high priority red blood cell determinants that we hypothesize are involved in strain-transcendent essential interactions between the host red blood cell and malaria parasite. In this proposal we will validate these genes as red blood cell determinants of strain- transcendent or strain- specific invasion. For this we will also leverage our development of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in an erythroid cell-line that supports P. falciparum invasion, and facilitates the knockout of RBC proteins. The precise step of P. falciparum invasion that is mediated by each red blood cell determinant will be identified. We will use the RBC mutants that we generate to identify specific parasite ligands using both candidate and unbiased screening approaches. Together, these studies will serve to shift the paradigm from a focus on alternative redundant invasion pathways to the functional analysis of essential strain-transcendent host- parasite interactions. In the long-term we hope that our studies will provide a functional understanding of critical ligand-receptor interactions for P. falciparum invasion of erythrocytes to inform vaccine development and the design of host-targeted therapeutics."
"9530101","Abstract Over 200 million people worldwide are infected with HCV. The majority of these people will progress to chronic infection, resulting in severe liver disease such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, an effective HCV vaccine would be ideal to prevent HCV infection and liver disease worldwide. Papillomavirus-like particles are the major components of the licensed human papillomavirus vaccines from GSK and Merck. The virus-like particles (VLPs) formed by papillomavirus L1 protein are highly immunogenic even in the absence of adjuvants. The surface loops of the L1 protein can be replaced to express foreign sequences and immunization with the VLPs formed by the chimeric proteins can induce strong antibody responses against the inserted epitopes. Furthermore, the VLPs are able to package DNA plasmids expressing genes of interest to form pseudoviruses (VLPs with plasmid inside). The pseudoviruses are able to elicit strong antibody and T-cell responses via systemic immunization. We hypothesize that papillomavirus pseudoviruses can be used to present linear HCV envelope epitopes to the immune system on the surface loops of L1 to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies while at the same time deliver plasmids encapsulated within the pseudovirus particles to induce strong HCV specific T-cells to the HCV NS3 protein. We plan to insert known HCV neutralizing antibody epitopes (polyprotein amino acids 412 ? 426 and 496 ? 515) into the bovine papillomavirus L1 protein three surface loops. We will make BPV-HCV chimeric VLPs (CVLPs) with the chimeric L1 and L2 proteins using a baculovirus expression system. We plan to immunize mice with the CVLPs and determine neutralizing antibody titers against HCV cell culture virus. The goal is to make a CVLP presenting the two HCV neutralizing epitopes. Furthermore, we will insert the HCV NS3/NS4A native sequence as well as a rearranged NS3 sequence into a plasmid for expression under a mammalian promoter. The rearranged sequence is to increase the instability of NS3 which will in turn increase degradation and result in increased T-cell responses. We will use the developed CVLP to package the plasmids to form BPV-HCV pseudoviruses. We will immunize mice with the pseudoviruses carrying the NS3/4A plasmids intramuscularly as well as Adenovirus expressing NS3/4A (a positive control) and test splenic T-cells by ELISPOT and flow cytometry to assess polyfunctionality and phenotypes induced by the pseudoviruses. Finally we will use the pseudovirus that induces strong neutralizing antibody and CTL responses to immunize a humanized HCV infection mouse model (Dorner-Ploss) which is susceptible to HCV infection, and challenge them with HCV to assess protective qualities of the induced immune responses."
"9417198","PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT 2 The central goal of Project 2 is to understand the various roles of alternative splicing in cancer, and to exploit cancer-specific features of this process to develop targeted-therapeutic approaches. Cancer cells display extensive qualitative and quantitative dysregulation of splicing, and a subset of the numerous isoforms that are inappropriately expressed contribute to tumorigenesis or altered cell metabolism. The mechanisms and pathways through which the splicing-factor oncoproteins SRSF2 and SRSF1 transform cells will continue to be investigated. Cell-culture models, as well as orthotopic and genetic mouse models will be used to study tumorigenesis promoted by these splicing factors upon mutation or overexpression in different cancer contexts, with an emphasis on recurrent mutations in myeloid dysplasias. High-throughput RNA-sequencing and computational analysis will be employed to identify and compare the splicing targets of these SR proteins in different cancer contexts, and selected targets will be characterized and manipulated to evaluate their contributions to tumorigenesis and potential as therapeutic targets or biomarkers. One key event, alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase pre-mRNA, which controls the distinctive glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells, will be thoroughly investigated as a potential therapeutic target, by specifically manipulating this process in vivo, using antisense technology and mouse models of glioma and hepatocellular carcinoma."
"9420466","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), is an inflammatory musculoskeletal disease than can lead to joint damage and disability and up to 45% of patients don't respond to biologic therapies. Major hurdles are a limited understanding of mechanisms causing inflammation and bone damage and the absence of markers that predict treatment response. Circulating osteoclast (OC) precursors (OCP), progenitors of bone resorbing OC, are increased in PsA blood and joints and these cells express membrane DC-STAMP, a molecule required for OCgenesis. DC-STAMP has an inhibitory motif (ITIM) in the cytoplasmic tail that regulates signaling. Our overarching hypothesis is that DC-STAMP regulates multiple steps during OCgenesis, has strong potential as a therapeutic target and may serve as an early response marker in inflammatory arthritis. To address these hypothesis, we plan 3 Specific Aims: Aim1: Regulation of cell-fusion and signaling by DC-STAMP during OCgenesis. Hypothesis: DC-STAMP is essential for early cell fusion, but negatively regulates late-stage osteoclastogenesis via ITIM inhibition of Ca+2 signaling and NFATc1 activation. To test this hypothesis, we will light activate chimeric rhodopsin-DC- STAMP chimeras with and without the ITIM, transfected into DC-STAMP-/-murine macrophages and analyze the ITIM effect on cell fusion and downstream signaling at different time points during OCgenesis. Aim2:Functional characterization of DC-STAMP+ monocytes in murine arthritis . Hypothesis: DC-STAMP+ monocytes promote synovial inflammation and bone destruction in the TNF-Tg mouse model of inflammatory-erosive arthritis. To test this hypothesis, bone marrow cells from WT or DC- STAMP-/- mice linked to GFP will be transferred into lethally-irradiated TNF-Tg mice and TNF-Tg bone marrow into irradiated DC-STAMP-/- mice. Joint inflammation and damage will be evaluated by clinical evaluation, Doppler Power ultrasound (PDUS)/micro-CT, and histologic analysis at different time points. The ability of the DC-STAMP 1A2 Ab to ameliorate or prevent arthritis onset will also be analyzed in these mice. Aim3: Assessment of DC-STAMP as an early treatment response marker in PsA. Hypothesis: Change in monocyte DC-STAMP expression at 2 weeks will predict long-term response to TNFi. To test this hypotheses, DC-STAMP monocyte expression in PsA and PDUS of inflamed joints will be assessed at baseline, 2 and 16 weeks after starting a TNFi or MTX. The primary outcome measure will be the change in the Disease Activity in PsA (DAPSA) at 16 weeks. The change in DC-STAMP at 2 weeks will be correlated with change in DAPSA and PDUS scores at 16 weeks. These studies will provide insights into key mechanisms that underlie PsA and catalyze biomarker discovery. Our results will also lead to therapies that target the DC-STAMP signaling pathway with potential to impede pathologic bone degradation in PsA, osteoporosis and other inflammatory bone and joint disorders."
"9170945","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Anticipated Impact on Veterans' Health Care: Veterans of OEF/OIF/OND are young, increasingly female, and include growing numbers of Veterans who have survived historically mortal injuries. These patriots face unique physical and mental health challenges that may be detrimental to future fertility; challenges include: sexual assault, blast injuries causing genito-urinary trauma and traumatic brain injury, chemical exposures, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Thus comprehensive, high-quality reproductive care, including infertility prevention and treatment, is vitally important for the post-deployment health and quality of life of this generatin of Veterans. Our goal is to better identify, understand, and treat infertility and to facilitate infertility care utilization for Veterans in order to make a positive impact on post-deployment health and quality of life for affected Veterans. Background: Responding to increased pressure from Veteran advocates and a Senate bill from December 2012, the VA recently renewed efforts to provide limited infertility care to Veterans. Very little is known about the true prevalence of infertility in Veterans, especially in the male population, or the impact of combat-related and sexual assault trauma on fertility, much less the existing disparities, barriers, and preferences regarding infertility care in the VA system. The Pentagon is monitoring the number of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans who have suffered pelvic or genital injuries that could impact reproductive capability, and traumatic injury benefits are now being paid to those affected. Sexual assault is an even more common trauma in female Veterans and a relatively overlooked issue for male Veterans; officials estimate that 26,000 military members were sexually assaulted in 2012 alone (up 35% from the previous year). Our team's study of 1,004 female Veterans suggested sexual assault is also a risk factor for infertility as well as for delay and avoidance o pregnancy. Other studies indicate duration of deployment, concurrent mental health diagnoses, and traumatic brain injury can also increase the risk of infertility in Veterans. Specific Aims: 1.  Assess infertility prevalence in a nationally representative sample of reproductive-aged male and female OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. 2. Compare prevalence of infertility in those who have and have not experienced sexual and/or combat-related trauma and quantitatively investigate how physical and psychological injury and biological and behavioral alternations mediate risk of infertility due to these traumas. 3. Use qualitative methods to further elucidate associations between trauma exposures and infertility, identify unexpected connections, and explore Veteran-identified best opportunities for VA intervention. Methods: Guided by a novel conceptual framework, we will use an explanatory mixed methods design: subject selection model for this study. To begin, quantitative data will be collected using computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) with nationally representative samples of male and female OEF/OIF/OND Veterans <45 years old in order to determine the prevalence of infertility. Associations between sexual assault and combat- related trauma and infertility will then be estimated using accelerated failure time and logistic regression models. Next we will qualitatively examine infertile Veterans unique experiences, exploring the complex relationships between trauma exposures, fertility outcomes and infertility care seeking. Data will be collected using semi-structured telephone interviews with a purposeful sampling of subjects identified as infertile in the CATI. This qualitative study phase will ensure that all relevant associations are analyzed in the quantitative analysis and will also extend our knowledge of Veteran preferences for infertility-related health services. Our conceptual framework will help integrate the quantitative and qualitative components coherently while emerging itself as an improved framework to guide next step interventions."
"9408652","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are an estimated 7 million family caregivers who live at least one hour from the care recipient and are described as distance caregivers (DCGs)1,2,3. DCGs are a growing demographic; a majority are significantly involved in making care decisions as well as managing daily aspects of their family member's care (transportation, finances)3-7. Their anxiety, distress, depression, and poor health status are comparable to, and at times worse than, their local counterparts and they incur financial costs due to travel or lost work time that far exceed those of local caregivers3. A particularly vulnerable sub-population of DCGs are those of patients with advanced cancer-many of whom are near the end of life. To date, no one has tested an intervention aimed at the unique needs of this vulnerable and growing group of caregivers. The need to improve outcomes for DCGs is well recognized and there have been national calls to examine interventions for DCGs1,19-21. We will be the first to test interventions tailored to the unique needs of DCGs and delivered using a videoconference format. The goal of this randomized trial is to test the effectiveness of two arms of an intervention that use videoconference technology for DCGs of patients with advanced cancer. Key components of the full intervention have been tested46,52 and shown effective in reducing untoward caregiver psychological outcomes; they have not been fully tested with DCGs using videoconference technology. The first arm (Closer), will provide a minimum of four videoconference meetings (over a 4-month period) where DCGs participate in patient-oncologist office visits. Also, each DCG will receive a minimum of four personalized coaching sessions (via videoconference) from a registered nurse trained to deliver the key components of the intervention. The second arm (Video-C Only) will consist solely of videoconferences that include the DCG during patient-oncologist office visits-a minimum of four meetings over a 4 month period. The control group will have access to a website (Web-Only) with links to publically available information on cancer, caregiving, and distance caregiving. We project enrolling 613 DCG subjects and patients over a 3 year enrollment period. The study aims are to: 1) Compare the direct effects of Closer, Video-C Only, and Web- Only on DCG outcomes (anxiety, distress, depression, health status) over time, controlling for DCG demographic variables, 2) Examine the indirect effects of Closer, Video-C Only, and Web-Only on DCG outcomes (anxiety, distress, depression, health status) over time, controlling for DCG demographic variables, and 3) Examine the relationships between DCG distress, anxiety, depression and health status and patient distress, anxiety and depression over time. Impact: This will be the first study to test interventions tailored to the unique needs of DCGs using a videoconference format. If our aims are met, use of the Closer intervention has the potential to reach all caregivers who experience barriers to active participation in their family member's care-regardless of distance."
"9607925","ABSTRACT Every year there are an estimated 7.9 million children born with a serious birth defect and 3.3 million of these are children under five years of age who die from factors related to their birth defect. Comprehensive, reliable data on birth defects are not available for most developing countries. In many resource-poor settings, the baseline prevalence of birth defects is not known and systematic monitoring for birth defects is difficult or non- existent. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) in pregnancy can maximally reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HIV, and therefore it is recommended that all pregnant women with HIV receive effective ART regimens to prevent the transmission of HIV to their infants. However, there have been concerns about the possibility of women on ART at conception or during the first trimester having an increased risk of delivering an infant with a birth defect. The goal of this proposal is to establish a birth defect hospital based surveillance program in Kampala, Uganda and to determine the prevalence of major external birth defects and association of maternal risk factors including antiretroviral therapy to these defects. Four hospitals in Kampala, Uganda will be included in the surveillance system with approximately 48,000 deliveries per year. Informative births (live and stillborn) regardless of gestational age that are born at the four hospitals will be included in the surveillance project for a duration of five years. Informative births are those in which the newborn is formed well enough to ascertain whether or not there is a birth defect. Each newborn will be examined as soon as possible after birth. Infant measurements (weight, head circumference and length) will be obtained and all newborns will be examined for major external birth defects by trained midwives. Newborns with major external birth defects will be photographed after obtaining consent and the photographs will be used to classify the diagnosis. As needed, the photos and verbatim descriptions will be sent to birth defect experts for confirmation of diagnoses and for coding of the birth defect using ICD-10 disease classification criteria. Demographic information, HIV status and obstetric information (parity status, previous live and still births, presence of physical defects of births of previous children) will be collected for all mothers. Every mother of an infant identified with a major external birth defect of interest will be asked to participate in a case-control study. Three controls will be selected for each case matched on hospital of delivery. After consenting, each mother will be asked to respond to questions regarding, types of medications taken during pregnancy including antiretroviral drugs and cotrimoxazole, medical history and more detailed demographic information. The surveillance program will provide crucial current data on the baseline prevalence of birth defects in Uganda while the case-control study will allow examination of the possible effects of antiretroviral treatment on infant outcomes while also screening for other common known causes of birth defects."
"9470981","Summary The 2018 Gordon Research Conference on New Antibacterial Discovery and Development and the companion Gordon Research Seminar will bring highly experienced leaders in antibacterial drug discovery and development together with young investigators and those new to the field of antibiotics research in order to enable the next generation of safe and effective drugs. Discussion leaders and speakers are chosen from academia, industry, and government agencies to emphasize the breadth of talent and leadership necessary to drive innovation around target discovery and validation, hit identification and chemical optimization, and clinical trial design and execution. Previous meetings have defined the problem of antibiotic resistance, the challenges in antibiotic discovery and development faced over the past two decades, and the need for new pathways for clinical development. Those meetings have successfully created a community of idea generation and collaboration in what is otherwise a highly competitive scientific arena. This meeting will build on those foundations by exploring 1) novel strategies for achieving potent and safe antibacterial drugs against the most difficult-to-treat organisms, 2) new approaches for diagnosing infections with the goal of broadening the opportunities for clinical development as well as guiding the appropriate use of precious new antibacterial drugs in the clinic, and 3) learnings from recent clinical programs with new and established targets which may be translatable to the next generation of antibacterial drugs. Many strategic and organizational changes have taken place in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry over the last few years as well as a shift in emphasis at academic and government research facilities from early basic science to translational research. Because of the ever-changing environment, there has never been a more critical time for fostering a community of intellectuals dedicated to innovation and calculated risk-taking. This GRC/GRS will enablecritical thinking, robust discussions around data gathering and interpretation, and learning from each other?s challenges and successes. Most importantly the GRC/GRS meeting will provide a community and support network for scientists who have dedicated their careers to one of the most difficult and essential areas of human medicine."
"9626981","Gram-positive bacteria harbor a second messenger signal molecule called cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP). C-di-AMP levels in bacterial cells regulate genomic integrity, cell wall homeostasis, biofilm formation, virulence, induction of host immune responses, and development of resistance to ?-lactam antibiotics. The intracellular concentration of this centrally important second messenger c-di-AMP is very critical to cellular physiology. However, the mechanisms of the precise regulation of c-di- AMP levels and c-di-AMP-mediated changes in gene expression are not completely understood. This is primarily due to the lack of structural information of proteins involved in these processes. A combination of three-dimensional structure determination with biochemical and genetic analysis is the best approach to accurately determine the details of how c-di-AMP levels are regulated and how does c-di-AMP exerts its affect on the activity of receptor proteins in mediating gene expression regulation. Therefore, we will use X-ray crystallography techniques coupled with novel in vitro and in vivo activity assays to determine a comprehensive view of how c-di-AMP metabolism and functions are accomplished in bacteria. These studies will pave our way for screening and development of compounds that can enhance or reduce the activity of key proteins thereby enabling the fine-tuning of c-di-AMP levels in the cell. Some of the many possible potential applications of such selected compounds include their use (a) as adjuvants to ?-lactam thereby restoring the efficacy of these antibiotics, (b) to facilitate the development of robust biofilms of commensal microflora, and (c) to develop commensal bacteria into efficient mucosal delivery systems of c-di-AMP vaccine adjuvant into host.  The overall goal of our laboratory is to elucidate mechanistic details of c-di-AMP regulation and eventually exploit this knowledge to develop non-traditional methods that will specifically target the pathogenic bacteria while sparing the commensal bacteria and strengthening the host's immune response.  "
"9294226","Impact on veterans: Among Veterans with cancer, improved care coordination is an improvement of the patient experience. If we can increase our understanding of care coordination and how best measure it, we will have a new set of tools with which to monitor and meet the needs of the Veteran cancer population. Future system improvements can be evaluated based upon their consequences for care coordination. It is possible that an improved patient-provider experience of coordination may also increase timeliness and quality of care. Background: Many definitions of care coordination have been proposed. The authors of one systematic review combined common elements from many definitions to develop this working definition: Care coordination is the deliberate organization of patient care activities between two or more participants (including the patient) involved in a patient's care to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services.  From the patient perspective, coordination problems may be experienced as a lack of guidance, or unreasonable levels of effort on their part, in meeting care needs during transfers among different nodes in the health care system. Few instruments are available to measure cancer care coordination. Furthermore, prior instruments do not include items that address significant domains, including the establishment of accountability, the facilitation of transfers, and health information technology-enabled coordination. Finally, no instruments have been developed specific to cancer patients in the Veterans Health Administration who interrelate within an integrated delivery system where the phenomenon of care coordination may be experienced differently than elsewhere. Objective: The objective of the current proposal is to develop a measure with which to systematically measure cancer care coordination from the patient perspective: the Cancer Care Coordination Monitor (CCC-M). Our study group intends to test a future intervention, involving electronic health information exchange and services, which will directly target cancer care coordination among patients and providers. Emerging activities in cancer care are being targeted towards coordination. Due to the pervasiveness of coordination activities, having measures available that accurately and reliably capture the experience of coordination will be of great value in assessing the effect of these interventions. Key operational stakeholders who can make use of our findings include our VISN 11 and the VA National Program for Oncology Services. Methods: To develop the Cancer Care Coordination Monitor (CCC-M), we propose a mixed method study. First, semi-structured interviews with patients will be done to review prior coordination items and generate new items based upon missing conceptual domains, as well as unique Veteran patient experiences. Second, we will field a finalized instrument to test its validity and psychometric properties with the following approaches: (a) exploratory factor analysis to assess subscales and internal consistency, (b) test-retest processes to determine reliability, (c) concurrent predictive validity to assess correlation with continuity of care."
"9417199","PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT 3 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a large and relatively understudied class of RNAs that have great potential to provide novel opportunities to influence gene regulation and cancer biology. The long-term goal of Project 3 is to identify lncRNAs that are over-expressed in breast cancer, define their role in the disease, and develop approaches to manipulate their expression in vivo to impact breast cancer progression. Here, a series of Aims are presented to determine the roles of Malat1 lncRNA, and several recently identified lncRNAs - Mammary Tumor Associated RNAs (MaTARs) - that are expressed in mouse models of luminal B and Her2/neu mammary cancer. We showed that Malat1 is over-expressed in mammary tumors and its genetic loss or knockdown results in differentiation of the primary tumor and a significant reduction in metastasis. Studies are proposed to identify the steps in metastasis that are dependent upon Malat1 and the critical regions of the RNA contributing to its function. Mouse models containing GFP- or bioluminescently-labeled breast tumor cells will be used to follow metastasis and in vivo antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) knockdown will provide a means to reveal the specific dependencies of Malat1 in the metastatic process. 3D tumor organoid cultures will be used to ascertain functional domains within Malat1 and to identify critical regions that are essential for tumorigenesis. The promoters of mammary tumor genes that are impacted upon Malat1 knockdown are enriched in Sox5 and Tcfcp2l1 binding sites. Studies are proposed to examine the role of these transcription factors, in conjunction with Malat1, to regulate the differentiation of primary tumors and the significant reduction in metastasis upon Malat1 knockdown. A series of studies are proposed to determine the function of 4 recently identified MaTARs that are expressed in a mammary tumor-specific manner. Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP) coupled to deep sequencing or mass spectrometry will be used to identify interacting DNA sequences and proteins. To evaluate the potential of these MaTARs as therapeutic targets genetic knockout mouse models will be established and crossed with mammary tumor models to assess the impact on tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. RNA-seq will be performed on knockout and wild-type tumors to identify global gene expression changes upon MaTAR loss. The expression level and breast cancer sub-type specificity of human MaTAR orthologs has been examined and will be correlated with overall and relapse-free survival, and metastatic incidence, and appropriate candidates will be studied in patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Together, the proposed studies will define the role of several lncRNAs in breast cancer biology, and determine their potential as therapeutic targets to impact breast cancer progression."
"9484334","PROJECT SUMMARY While the existence of multiple memory systems in the brain is generally accepted, it is not known how these different systems interact to result in continuously adaptive memory-guided behaviors and decisions. Recent results clearly show that particular combinations of memory-related brain systems show synchronized neural activity (at the population level, for example at the theta frequency) in a task-dependent way. Yet the informational and behavioral significance of such co-modulation of neural activity in not known perhaps in part because such measures are not temporally or informationally refine enough to reveal the significance of this interaction. This proposal aims to develop a novel paradigm for determining whether a specific type of information in one brain area can provide a signal to a connected memory structure to engage or disengage in its well-known memory-related function. Specifically, Aim 1 will test the causal relationship between neural signatures of planned behaviors in hippocampus and the regulation of working memory/action selection by the medial prefrontal cortex. Also, the subsequent impact of this neural directive on future action selection, as well as on future hippocampal place field integrity, will be examined. It is postulated that prefrontal cortex normally stabilizes place fields which in turn should enable rats to more quickly adapt to changing task conditions. Disruption of such prefrontal function, especially during the operation of working memory, should destabilize place fields and EEG phenomena that rely on fully function place fields. In addition, impaired choice accuracy is predicted. Aim 2 proposes to build on the exciting idea that hippocampal theta oscillates between periods of memory encoding and memory retrieval. The same open loop system that was developed in Aim 1 will be used to disrupt selectively working memory encoding or retrieval functions of the medial prefrontal cortex when encoding or retrieval are detected in hippocampus. The general prediction is that disrupting encoding in the prefrontal cortex will disproportionately impair the initial learning behavioral and neural processes relative to behavioral and neural processes that go on after learning has taken place. The combined results will provide new insight into the informational nature of communication between hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Also the closed loop paradigm can serve as an innovative and new model for studying the functional interactions between other memory and behavioral systems of the brain, which in turn can have tremendous clinical and therapeutic benefits. It may be possible to interfere with (in cases of unwanted specific associations) or facilitate (in cases of deficient desired associations) specific types of learning or learned associations that characterize a number of mental disorders."
"9451980","Project Summary. Obesity represents a state of chronic, low-grade tissue inflammation that contributes to insulin resistance (IR) steatosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The demands for effective therapy call for improved understanding of the disease. There is a significant gap in our understanding of the endogenous factors that regulate both inflammatory responses and insulin sensitivity. In this application, we showed that a peptide, catestatin (CST), derived from a gene product, chromogranin A (CgA), directly improves lipid disposal and inflammation leading to reversal of insulin resistance (IR) in a mouse model of obesity. CST improved IR in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice without weight loss. We generated CST-deficient knockout (CST-KO) mice, which are obese and insulin resistant in normal chow diet. As a possible mechanism, our data suggested that CST raised AMP levels by inhibiting AMP-deaminase (AMPD), stimulated AMP-dependent Kinase (AMPK) signaling and AKT phosphorylation in DIO liver as well as in hepatocyte cultures, signifying a direct CST effect. This activation of AMPK and AKT signaling by CST suppresses gluconeogenesis via phosphorylation of CRTC2 and FoxO1 and elevates glycogen production via activation of phosphoglucomutase (PGM). Another consequence of CST action is to attenuate inflammation, mediated by macrophages, in an AMPK-dependent manner. This is accomplished by suppressing cytokine production and proinflammatory signaling, which in turn, could enhance AKT signaling. Analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the sections of liver and adipose tissue of DIO mice after CST treatment indicated diminished infiltration or recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages. We hypothesize that CST inhibits activity of AMPD2 giving rise to elevated level of AMP, and activation of AMPK, which in turn, reduces steatosis and macrophage-mediated inflammation leading to enhancement of insulin signaling and suppression of gluconeogenesis in DIO and CST-KO mice. We will verify our hypothesis by working with two specific aims: Aim I. To test whether CST suppresses hepatic glucose production through activation of AMPK via inhibition of AMP-deaminase 2 (AMPD2) which elevates AMP levels necessary for AMPK activation. In this aim, we will examine the mechanism of CST action in liver and hepatocyte focusing on AMPK and PGM activation. Aim II. To test the hypothesis that CST-mediated activation of AMPK leads to suppression of inflammation and glucose production via enhancement of AKT signaling in DIO and CST-KO mice. In this aim, we will analyze the pathways invoked by CST-mediated AMPK activation that lead to suppression of inflammation and glucose production. We will execute these specific aims by knocking down activities of AMPD2 and AMPK? and analyzing their impacts on CST mediated signaling, AMP/ATP ratio, PGM activity, cytokine and glucose production. Through investigation with this proposal, we believe we will discover a novel pathway for regulation of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis."
"9545161","Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), as a classic approach for cancer immunotherapy, can cure a variety of hematopoietic malignances such as leukemia, termed as the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains the primary case of transplant-related morbidity and mortality, thereby limiting the use of allo-HCT. GVHD develops in two forms: acute and chronic with distinct etiology, pathophysiology, and response to therapeutic regimens. aGVHD is primarily induced by T cells commonly characterized by a type I T-cell response; whereas cGVHD is induced by both T and B cells similar in nature to autoimmune disorders. Despite advances in patient care and pharmacologic prophylaxis strategies, the incidence of GVHD particular cGVHD has not been substantially reduced over the years. Because effective treatment options are very limited beyond steroids, it is urgently required to further understand cGVHD pathogenesis and identify novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of the devastating disease as a major complication of allo-HCT. Sphingolipids are involved in signaling pathways that mediate cell growth, differentiation, cell death and multiple cell functions. Ceramide is considered at the central hub of sphingolipid metabolism and can be synthesized by de novo mechanism that involves 6 key enzyme ceramide synthases (CerSs). The importance of lipid rafts and ceramide platforms in modulating immune responses of T and B cells has been elucidated. Our preliminary data shows that T cells deficient for CerS6 impaired TCR-signaling, activation, and pathogenecity in the induction of aGVHD. We hypothesize that ceramide synthesis mediated by CerS6 is critical for the activation and function of both T and B cells, and thus CerS6 can a valid therapuetic target for the control of cGVHD. To test the hypothesis, we propose to pursue two Specific Aims: 1) Define the role of CerS6 in T- and B-cell responses in the development of cGVHD after allogeneic HCT; 2) Determine the therapeutic effect of CerS6-inhibitor in the control of cGVHD. If Aims are achieved as expected, the project will set a platform for further studying how sphingolipid metabolism affects adaptive immunity and identify novel molecular targets for manipulating immune response."
"9450071","Project Summary/Abstract:  More than 30 years after the discovery of HIV, there are still no vaccines or microbicides to prevent HIV infection. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is successful in suppressing virus replication, but it does not clear the virus, offers only partial immunologic recovery, and requires lifelong adherence. A better understanding of basic HIV?host cell interactions is needed to develop new strategies to prevent HIV infection. This proposed study seeks to investigate the interplay of HIV with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and helper CD4 T (Th) cells in the presence of anti-HIV antibodies (Abs) that retard virus spread to Th cells.  CD4 Th cells are the main cell type infected by HIV, but not all Th cells are equally vulnerable. As compared with Th1 cells, Th17 cells are preferentially targeted by HIV, in part due to higher expression of HIV envelope (Env) receptors, including ?4?7. Our recent studies showed that Th17 cells are also preferentially targeted by HIV transmitted from APCs. However, different outcomes arise from HIV interactions with Th cells and distinct APCs. HIV-exposed monocytes efficiently transmit virus to Th17 cells while stimulating Th proliferation, resulting in expansion in the number of infected Th17 cells. In contrast, virus transmission from HIV-exposed monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) causes the number of Th17 cells to decline. Further, we observed that in the immunological synapses between Th cells and APCs, HIV Env enhances Th cell activation by acting like a co-stimulatory molecule. Th cells thus co-stimulated become more permissive to HIV infection.  HIV Env is the key determinant that regulates virus transmission to Th cells and cellular activation of target Th cells. HIV transmission varies depending on Env co-receptor tropisms (CCR5 vs CXCR4) and is sensitive to interference by anti-Env Abs. HIV-induced enhancement of Th cell activation also is triggered by Env and suppressed by anti-Env Abs. On the basis of these findings, we propose to further investigate the HIV Env determinants influencing the efficiency of virus transmission from APCs to Th cells. Our hypothesis is that HIV utilizes the intimate cell-cell contact between APCs and Th cells to spread to Th cells and also to enhance Th cell activation, rendering them more permissive for virus replication, through the action of the virus Env. Therefore, anti-Env Abs, by forming immune complexes with HIV virions, may alter APC-Th cell interactions to blunt virus transmission and replication.  To test these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will define HIV Env determinants that are essential for efficient transmission from APCs to Th cells. Monocytes and MDDCs treated with HIV will be tested as APCs in a co- culture system to stimulate Th1 and Th17 cells and transmit viruses with distinct Envs. The Env variables to be evaluated include co-receptor usage, N-glycan sugar composition, and affinity for ?4?7 and mannose-binding receptors. Aim 2 is to evaluate the ability of anti-Env Abs to retard virus transmission from APCs to Th cells. We will test neutralizing and nonneutralizing monoclonal Abs specific for distinct epitopes, and polyclonal Abs generated by Env epitope-targeted vaccines. Fc-mediated activities of the Abs will also be assessed. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test HIV transmission from APCs in vivo, using the humanized mouse model. Anti-Env Abs with inhibitory activity in vitro will also be evaluated in the mouse model. The proposed experiments will generate data to inform future development of more effective prophylactic agents against HIV."
"9453534","Abstract Long-term viral suppression with antiretroviral treatment (ART) is difficult to maintain over the course of an entire lifetime, and significant toxicities to ART may accumulate with time. Novel strategies that maintain HIV viral suppression while allowing time off 3-drug ART are needed, and proof-of-concept studies to demonstrate the feasibility of such a strategy ? and to study its impact on viral reservoir, immune responses, and clinical outcomes ? are of high priority. We propose an open-label Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the efficacy of the broadly neutralizing HIV-1 monoclonal antibody VRC01 to maintain viral suppression in the absence of ART among virally suppressed HIV-infected children who started standard ART within 96 hours of birth (or soon after intrapartum infection). All children will be recruited from the Early Infant Treatment (EIT) study (U01AI114235), and have been followed from birth with frequent assessments of their clinical, virologic and immunologic characteristics. Children who have received 96-240 weeks of ART and meet virologic entry criteria will be offered enrollment into the proposed study. The intervention will consist of ongoing ART plus infusions of VRC01 antibodies for a period of 6 weeks, followed by monthly maintenance administration of VRC01 treatment alone for up to 24 additional weeks. Children receiving VRC01 maintenance therapy will be monitored closely, with immediate re-initiation of ART following any VL > 400 copies/mL. All participants will resume ART at week 30. The study is designed to evaluate three possible benefits of VCR01 therapy in HIV-1- infected children: 1) we will characterize the duration of virologic control that can be maintained with VRC01 treatment following early ART, providing proof-of-concept that VRC01 may serve as a possible alternative to standard ART in children with low viral reservoirs; 2) we will investigate whether VRC01 therapy is associated with changes in the size and/or the cellular or clonal composition of residual viral reservoirs, which will be highly informative for developing strategies to limit viral persistence and to destabilize viral reservoir homeostasis in pediatric patients; and 3) we will evaluate whether treatment with VRC01 is associated with qualitative or quantitative changes in innate or adaptive antiviral immune responses, and if it facilitates the development of an antiviral immune profile that can enable spontaneous post-treatment viral control."
"9523534","ABSTRACT Malaria-related mortality is falling, due in part to the implementation of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) treatment programs. RDTs have become the primary modality for diagnosis of malaria globally, including in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most widely used RDTs rely on the detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), an antigen specific to P? lasmodium falciparum? encoded by the ?pfhrp2? gene. However, false-negative results have recently been reported in individuals infected with P? . falciparum ?parasites harboring a deletion of the ?pfhrp2? gene with or without a deletion in a related histidine-rich protein gene, pfhrp3?. These parasites have been commonly described in South America and sporadically in other regions, including Africa. Until recently, the prevalence and impact of ?pfhrp2? deletions deletions in Africa was unknown. We recently completed a large cross-sectional survey of more than 7,000 children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where RDTs have been the primary mode of diagnosis since 2011. We found that 6.4% of parasitemic children had false-negative RDTs due to a p? fhrp2? deletion. In Kinshasa province, more than 20% of infections were due to ?pfhrp2?-deleted parasites. Similar findings are being made in other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, raising the possibility that HRP2-based RDTs are becoming ineffective. Currently, our collaborators are conducting a longitudinal cohort study in Kinshasa to evaluate the epidemiology of ?pfhrp2/3 deleted parasites. Our proposal will leverage this cohort to achieve our short-term goals to (1) understand the evolutionary drivers of these deletions in the DRC, the country in Africa with the second-highest malaria burden; and (2) to develop a simple PCR assay for ?pfhrp2/3? deletion surveillance so that malaria control programs can implement alternative diagnostics when needed. Our long-term goal is to develop alternate biomarkers and noninvasive diagnostic tests for malaria diagnosis and test them in an area of HRP2-based RDT failure. This proposal is unique in that it will help characterize an emerging public health problem while simultaneously seeking solutions. As a result, there is a high likelihood that the results of this research will significantly impact the next generation of point of care malaria diagnostic tests."
"9452688","Pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction are extremely common in veterans. Up to 80% of veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, sleep disordered breathing or LV dysfunction (either systolic or diastolic) suffer from PH. Better RV function and female sex have been linked to improved survival in PH, and female patients exhibit better RV function than their male counterparts. This proposal builds on the scientific premise that even though RV function and female sex are major determinants of survival in PH, no RV-specific or sex steroid-directed therapies exist. Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and impaired angiogenesis play a major role in the development of RV failure, and data obtained in the previous funding period demonstrate that the female sex steroid 17?-estradiol (E2) increases capillary density in the RV and stimulates angiogenesis in cultured cardiac ECs. The goal of this proposal is to identify novel and therapeutically targetable mechanisms by which E2 exerts protective effects on RV EC function in PH. We provide evidence that E2 exerts its RV EC-protective effects via its receptor ER?, and suggest a new mechanism by which ER? activates bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) signaling to upregulate apelin, a potent angiogenesis mediator and EC survival factor, whose regulation in the RV is not yet known. Based on these findings, we now put forward the novel hypothesis that E2 improves RV function in PH by ER?- and BMPR2-dependent up-regulation of EC apelin. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To establish that E2 increases capillary density in the RV via BMPR2-dependent increases in EC apelin, and 2) To identify the contribution of ER? to increasing capillary density in the RV. We generated a novel ER? knockout rat that will enable us to study the role of ER? in the rat pulmonary artery banding model, thus avoiding the pitfalls of prior studies of sex hormone signaling performed in PH models without RV failure. These studies will be complemented by studies of BMPR2-deficient rats and apelin-deficient mice. These loss- of-function studies will be accompanied by studies in which we interrogate the therapeutic potential of ER? agonists, BMPR2 activators and apelin receptor agonists. We will complement these in vivo studies with experiments in RV ECs isolated from rodents with RV failure and from patients with compensated (adaptive) or decompensated (maladaptive) RV hypertrophy. Endpoints investigated will include RV function and structure (by pressure volume loops and echocardiography), exercise capacity (measured as VO2 max via treadmill running), RV capillary density (quantified using unbiased stereology and lectin staining), angiogenesis assays (matrigel tube formation and transwell migration), BMPR2 and apelin signaling pathways, as well as mediators of angiogenesis and EC survival and apoptosis. The proposed studies are significant, since they will 1) identify ER? as a critical modulator of RV function and 2) establish a novel and therapeutically targetable E2-ER?- BMPR2-apelin axis in RV ECs. The proposed studies are innovative, since they, for the first time, will provide a molecular basis for E2's RV- and EC-protective effects in PH. In addition, they provide technical innovation through use of a newly generated ER? knockout rat model, through use of a new highly selective ER? agonist that will allow for mechanistic dissection of ER??s role in ECs from failing RVs, and through use of unbiased stereology. Upon completion of the proposed studies, we will have identified ER? as a novel mediator of adaptive signaling in RV ECs. This may ultimately allow for the development of new RV-directed, non- hormonal treatments for both female and male veterans with PH and RV failure."
"9448481","Central leptin resistance results in decreased downstream signaling to brain circuits that regulate food intake and energy expenditure (EE), thereby promoting hyperphagia and obesity. We and others have shown that the nonapeptide, oxytocin (OT), circumvents leptin resistance and elicits body weight (BW) loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents, nonhuman primates and obese humans, by reducing both food intake and increasing EE. The discovery of recruitable brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has renewed interest in targeting BAT to elicit weight loss by increasing EE. OT neurons that project directly from the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN) to the hindbrain nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) are positioned to regulate energy homeostasis by reducing food intake and increasing BAT thermogenesis. In Specific Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that OT-induced stimulation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) outflow to interscapular (IBAT) contributes to its ability to elicit weight loss in DIO rodents. To test this, we will determine whether disrupting sympathetic activation of IBAT blocks the ability of fourth ventricular (4V) OT administration to increase EE and elicit weight loss in DIO rats. We will also determine if sympathetic outflow to both IBAT and white adipose tissue (WAT) mediates the effects of OT on EE by testing the extent to which pharmacological blockade of beta-3 adrenergic receptors (?-3-AR) impairs the ability of 4V OT administration to increase EE in DIO rats. In addition, we will determine if OT can be combined with low doses of the ?-3-AR agonist, CL316243, to increase EE and promote weight loss in DIO rats. Endpoints will include EE, IBAT temperature, norepinephrine turnover (NETO; marker of sympathetic activity), food intake, body composition (total and relative fat mass, lean mass), and BW. We anticipate these studies to establish a key role for SNS outflow to IBAT in the mechanism by which OT increases EE and elicits BW loss in DIO rats. In Specific Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that in DIO rhesus monkeys, intranasal OT reduces BW and improves glucose tolerance and other metabolic parameters, in part, by stimulating SNS outflow to BAT. To accomplish this, we will determine if intranasal OT increases the temperature of axillary BAT (ABAT, the predominant BAT depot found in rhesus monkeys) at a dose that elicits weight loss in DIO NHPs. We will also determine the extent to which intranasal OT elicits weight loss by reducing body adiposity while sparing lean mass and identify if these effects are associated with improvements in glucose tolerance. We will further identify if intranasal OT may also increase SNS outflow to WAT by measuring changes in subcutaneous WAT temperature and uncoupling protein-1 protein expression in subcutaneous WAT relative to ABAT (pre- and post-intervention). If we find that intranasal OT increases EE and BAT thermogenesis in the NHP model, these studies will provide evidence for a role for BAT activation in how OT elicits weight loss in a translational model of diet-induced obesity. Moreover, these studies will identify intranasal OT as a potential treatment option to evoke weight loss and improve glucose tolerance in humans and direct future studies to address the extent to which intranasal OT may reverse obesity in humans by stimulating BAT thermogenesis."
"9617044","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goals of the Cancer Cell Biology Program are: (i) to understand, at the molecular and cellular levels, mechanisms underlying tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and resistance to therapeutic treatment, and (ii) to identify and validate new targets for cancer therapy. Insight derived from these studies, when integrated with research and development from other programs, will provide targets and guidance for the development of strategies for therapeutic intervention of cancer. Toward these two goals, the Program faculty investigates various aspects of cancer cell biology, including growth factors and receptors; angiogenesis and vascular biology; apoptosis; cell cycle regulation; chromatin biochemistry and transcriptional regulation; cell microstructure and function; DNA replication and repair; metabolism; regulatory RNA; and signal transduction. Led by two co-leaders with complementary expertise, Yue Xiong and James Bear, the program organizes these different areas into four major research themes: (1) Cell Cycle, (2) Cell Signaling, (3) Cell Movement and Organization, and (4) Epigenetics and Chromatin Biology. The major emphasis of the Program is to foster integrated research that spans these inter-related themes, enhancing the research and translational capabilities of program investigators through the establishment, expansion and utilization of appropriate core facilities, and promoting interactions with investigators from other LCCC basic, clinical and population sciences programs.         The Cancer Cell Biology Program consists of 45 members who are associated with 7 basic science and 4 clinical departments at UNC-Chapel Hill. During the last funding period, program members have published 644 cancer-related articles (30% collaborative). In 2014, our program members held 101 grants and $27.3M (total cost) in annual extramural funding, including 24 grants and $5.8M (total costs) from the NCI."
"9440326","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Despite the hope that pharmacogenomics (PGx) will improve the risk-benefit ratio of certain medications, there is little empiric evidence about how PGx might impact patient outcomes such as drug safety and effectiveness. The research activities in this career development award will use simvastatin PGx as a model of the impact of genomic medicine on patient outcomes. Statins are cholesterol-lowering medications that have dramatically reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death in millions of Americans. Statins can also cause muscle injury (myopathy) ranging from mild muscle aches to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified a locus in the SLCO1B1 gene that is associated with the risk of statin-associated myopathy. Up to twenty percent of Americans carry at least one copy of the C allele at SLCO1B1 rs4149056, which increases the risk of myopathy greater than four-fold. PGx testing for the SLCO1B1 locus might improve the safety of statin use in patient care. However, at the same time, SLCO1B1 testing may result in insufficient statin dosing for a given patient's level of CVD risk. To examine the impact of statin PGx on patient outcomes, this project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of SLCO1B1 testing in a Veteran patient population. First, metrics will be developed for statin-related patient outcomes in the VA health system. VA provider notes will be used to develop and validate a natural language processing algorithm to identify statin myopathy from text from the electronic health record. VA clinical and administrative data will be used to develop informatics-based approaches to categorize Veterans into American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) CVD risk categorizes and determine whether their statin doses are appropriate for their level of CVD risk. These metrics will then be used as outcomes for a randomized controlled trial determining the impact of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 testing on statin safety and appropriate statin dosing among 408 VA primary care patients. Veterans at higher CVD risk will be randomized to undergo SLCO1B1 testing versus no testing in the course of usual primary care. After one year, the two groups will be compared regarding the occurrence of statin myopathy, cholesterol levels, and concordance with ACC/AHA guidelines for CVD prevention and PGx guidelines for simvastatin safety. In addition to gathering empiric evidence about the impact of statin PGx on Veteran health outcomes, this career development award includes mentorship, coursework, and seminars in translational genomics, PGx, and innovative randomized controlled trial design. The research and career development activities will prepare the applicant for his long-term goal of a research career in translational genomics that informs how genomic medicine might be used to improve Veteran health."
"9453576","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a frequent complication of type 2 diabetes that impairs quality of life for up to 75% of men with diabetes. ED strongly correlates with insulin resistance, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the poorly understood pathogenesis of ED in diabetic and pre- diabetic states. The brain serves a key role in healthy erectile function by initiating sexual desie and by controlling autonomic erectile responses. Melanocortin pathways, consisting of POMC neurons that produce a- MSH and downstream MC3 and 4 receptor (MC4R)-containing neurons, are critical for these processes. However, therapeutics targeting MC receptors have the disadvantage of altering blood pressure and heart rate. The objective of this proposal is to determine if reduced endogenous a-MSH production can lead to ED and to identify the neuronal circuitry to which POMC neurons project to uniquely control erectile function. MC4Rs are found on oxytocin neurons to which POMC neurons project, and administration of a-MSH, MC4R agonists, or oxytocin increases sexual motivation, elicits sexual behaviors, and causes penile erection in mice and humans. The central hypothesis is that insulin and leptin resistance in POMC neurons promotes ED by reducing aMSH production and oxytocin signaling. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories and will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Determine whether impaired insulin and leptin signaling in POMC neurons alters erectile function, 2) Determine whether restoring neuronal insulin and leptin sensitivity and a-MSH production improves sexual performance, and 3) Determine whether downstream oxytocin circuitry mediates the effects of a-MSH on erectile function. Under the first aim, novel cell type-specific tools will be used to allow acute neuronal manipulation to examine the role of POMC-specific insulin and leptin resistance in ED in a unique mouse model of prediabetes. In the second aim, the applicants will then determine whether reactivating hypothalamic leptin and insulin pathways restores normal sexual function and offers a potential treatment strategy in cases of central insulin and leptin resistance caused by diet-induced obesity. Under the third aim, the applicants will determine whether downstream oxytocin circuitry mediates the effects of a-MSH on erectile function using pharmacogenetics to examine whether this pathway is necessary and sufficient. A well-established cre-dependent viral tracer will then be employed to map downstream circuitry. The rationale for these studies is that they will be the first to address whether diabetes is accompanied by defective melanocortin signaling that may cause or exacerbate ED. The rising number of men with obesity and type 2 diabetes makes this research highly significant. Given the involvement of melanocortin pathways in regulating blood pressure, obesity, and glycemic control, the proposed research has the potential to guide the development of novel and effective therapies devoid of side effects that improve both the quality of life and overall health of these patients."
"9650539","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Heart attack and stroke, which together are called cardiovascular disease, cause over 1/3 of all deaths in VA patients. The current guidelines for the prevention of these conditions focus on lowering patients' blood pressure and cholesterol levels. A new treatment strategy, which I call benefit-based tailored treatment, that instead guides treatment decisions based on the likelihood that a medication would prevent a heart attack or stroke could prevent more cardiovascular disease, with lower medication use, and be more patient centered. The purpose of this Career Development Award is to develop and assess tools and approaches that could enable the implementation of benefit-based tailored treatment of cardiovascular disease, in particular a decision support tool and educational program for clinicians and a performance profiling system. The decision support tool will enable better care by showing clinicians patient-specific estimates of the likelihood that their medication decisions will prevent a cardiovascular disease event. The performance profiling system will encourage better care by assessing the quality of care provided at VA sites and in PACT teams based on how well the medical care provided follows this treatment strategy. The project will have three aims. Aim 1: In the first aim, I will seek to understand clinicians' and patients' perceptions of and receptivity to the use of benefit-based tailored treatment for cardiovascular disease. Information gained from qualitative research with clinicians will help assess and improve the usability and effectiveness of the decision support tool and educational program for clinicians, along with the acceptability of the treatment strategies in general. Information gained from focus groups with patients will help learn their priorities in cardiovascular disease prevention, to help identify ways to make the interventions and their assessments more patient-centered. Aim 2: In the second aim, the decision support tool and educational program will be assessed in a real-world randomized pilot study involving thirty clinicians. Half of the clinicians will be provided the decision support tool and education intervention for ten patients each, the other half will receive a traditional quality improvement program and treatment reminders. The study will have formative goals of ensuring that clinicians and patients believe the tool is valuable and does not disrupt care processes or workflow for anyone in the PACT team. This will be studied with qualitative and survey assessments. The primary summative outcome will be the influence of the intervention on clinicians' treatment decisions. Secondary outcomes will assess patients' satisfaction with their visits and their clinicians. Aim 3: The third aim will develop and evaluate a novel performance measurement system based on benefit- based tailored treatment. First, the performance profiling system will be developed. Then the profiling system's ability to reliably differentiate high quality from low-quality care will be evaluated."
"9546251","PROJECT SUMMARY Malaria remains a major global infectious disease, largely affecting people living in resource poor environments. Infection of humans with Plasmodium falciparum parasites results in significant morbidity and mortality. Drug- resistance is constantly undermining the usefulness of antimalarial regimens. It is imperative to identify new antimalarial drug targets to ensure the success of control and eradication efforts. Further, the call for malaria eradication requires an understanding of the determinants of parasite transmission. Plasmodium falciparum parasites utilize epigenetic machinery for the regulation of key processes within the parasitic life-cycle, including antigenic variation for persistence and pathogenesis during asexual proliferation, as well as for switching to sexual development for transmission through the parasitic life-cycle. We have obtained genetic evidence that the Class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) are essential for P. falciparum growth during the asexual cycle. We hypothesize that these P. falciparum HDACs regulate discrete and critical functions in the asexual and sexual biology of the parasite. Inhibition of these mechanisms will result in the specific killing of P. falciparum asexual and/or sexual forms. In this proposal, we will identify the essential functions of these enzymes that are responsible for asexual proliferation, conversion to the sexual stage, and sexual development for transmission. We will use a reverse genetics approach for the phenotypic analysis of mutant parasites in the asexual and sexual stages. We will probe the mechanistic basic of HDAC functions using a combination of bulk and single cell transcriptomics and epigenomics. Finally, we will uncover the precise mechanisms of action of the HDACs by dissecting the functions of their specific enzymatic domains, using biochemical and chemical genetic approaches. Together, these studies will serve to elucidate the functions of these critical epigenetic regulators in parasite biology relevant to asexual proliferation for virulence and sexual development for transmission, validating and characterizing these molecules as new targets for therapeutic development within the parasite."
"9429090","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Historically, bacteria were either seen as pathogenic if they caused disease or benign if they lived commensally with the host. In many cases, however, single organisms have not been identified that are consistently associated with disease, but rather it is thought that bacterial community structure and bacteria- bacteria interactions differ between healthy and diseased individuals, otherwise known as dysbiosis. Naturally, investigating the microbiomes of healthy and diseased individuals using systems biology methodology could lead to insight into the processes that underlie dysbiosis. To that end, methodology has been developed to identify co-occurrence networks from microbiome data. However, to date this methodology has primarily been applied to healthy microbiome datasets and we still lack an understanding of the common properties of dysbiosis. To address these gaps, I propose to build gut microbiome co-occurrence networks for 34 immune diseases and 133 quantitative phenotypes using ~2,500 individuals from the United Kingdom Adult Twins Registry (TwinsUK), for which microbiome and phenotype data has previously been collected. First, I will identify disease-associated bacteria using generalized and linear mixed models that take into account relatedness between individuals. Next, I will use a simulation framework to compare six microbiome co- occurrence network software packages to quantify the consistency of co-occurrence networks for individuals either i) with and without disease or ii) from opposite tails of quantitative phenotype distributions. Using these networks, I will identify modules of co-occurring bacteria that are differentially abundant in disease, examine general network statistics (such as modularity and diversity), and examine the properties of disease-associated nodes as determined in Aim 1 (such as degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality). Additionally, I will take advantage of the twin relationships in our data to identify heritable network characteristics and examine co- heritability of pairs of bacteria. Finally, this will be the first study to compare these network statistics across a range of diseases in order to develop a model of how microbiome network structure differs in health and disease. Additionally, I will compare underlying network structure across phenotypes to identify diseases that share similar gut microbiome alterations. Understanding the gut microbiome at this level will be beneficial for designing therapies to target the microbiota and ultimately improve human health."
"9349958","Sepsis affects over 750,000 people per year in the United States and kills over a third of these patients. As such, it has proved to be one of the greatest challenges to modern medicine. The cellular and molecular events underlying the evolution of tissue injury and organ dysfunction during sepsis are under active investigation and promise to guide the development of therapeutics. As of now the treatment of sepsis is limited to treatment of the underlying infection and supportive care, without much of a individualized approach. An area of intense recent focus is bioenergetics, the mitochondria, and metabolomics. Mitochondrial responses are now known to orchestrate downstream cell signaling responses and outcomes, and thus greatly influence organ function and outcomes. Others and we demonstrate that in the setting of sepsis, signals to the mitochondria to regulate mitochondrial respiration and signaling from the mitochondria to regulate inflammatory responses are not only important in the early response to sepsis, but also critical to the recovery of the cell.  Our preliminary data show that sepsis patients have a profile of injured mitochondria. Additionally, that aging is associated with decreased mitochondrial reserve and less dynamic responses. Mitochondrial health and the ability to adapt to stimuli are crucial to the survival of organisms during stress. We show that during this response mitochondrial respiration is altered and that the mitochondrion orchestrates this response by initiating adaptive signaling responses. As a result mitochondria may become dysfunctional, and processes to mitigate this, including removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagic cell signaling (controlled removal of the organs) leads to decreased cell injury. Additionally reconstitution of a healthy mitochondrial population via mitochondrial biogenesis is necessary to ensure survival.  Based upon this we hypothesize the following: The baseline `health' of the mitochondrial network and the ability to adapt through robust mitochondrial dynamic responses are critical to limit inflammation, tissue injury, and organ dysfunction in sepsis.  We will test this hypothesis by addressing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To determine how bioenergetics/mitochondrial health influences organ injury and outcomes in sepsis. Specific Aim 2. To examine how mitophagy/biogenesis inducing therapies can be harnessed for therapeutic benefit in sepsis.  Our laboratory has been investigating organ injury in sepsis and the role of mitochondrial signaling. These novel studies will add insight into organ dysfunction in sepsis, have the promise of allowing determination of at risk patients and a personalized approach to sepsis treatment, and will help guide the development of therapeutics."
"9447758","Early in cancer growth, metastases and dendritic cells (DCs) traffic to draining lymph nodes (DLN). In lung cancer and other carcinomas, immune-suppression dominates a tumor microenvironment characterized by immature DCs, weak T-effector responses, proliferation of T-regulatory cells (Tregs), and over-production of immuno-suppressive cytokines. This heavily represses anti-tumor immunity. A high-impact area of new scientific discovery is immunotherapy. We find dramatic clinical responses in some advanced-stage cancer patients by blocking suppression of effector T cells. Only a fraction (<25%) of such patients, however, respond with durable remissions. Preliminary work shows that a unique class of glycans known as heparan sulfate (HS) drives subversive DC traffic and DC immaturity. While we have inhibited such DC traffic by targeting lymphatic endothelial HS, new work suggests that DC-specific HS alterations may modulate both pathologic chemokine- dependent DC traffic as well as DC maturation and function. New studies also show that these properties may favorably impact anti-tumor T cell functions, with inhibition of tumor growth and progression. Herein we target such glycans in tumor and cell-based studies, while studying immune-function and molecular mechanisms. This proposal addresses the hypothesis that targeting HS glycans on the surface of DCs in lung cancer through genetic means and novel inhibitors will inhibit DLN colonization by tolerogenic DCs and improve anti- tumor immunity. Reduced immune-tolerance and improved tumor-antigen responses by more mature DCs, with improved T cell induction will result in a novel endogenous anti-tumor state. To test this, we propose to: (1) Characterize tumor growth and anti-tumor immunity in model antigen- as well as spontaneous lung carcinoma models in mice bearing DC-glycan alterations. We will assess how a DC-targeted mutation in a key sulfating HS biosynthetic enzyme (Ndst1) affects T cell immunity in tumors and thoracic DLN of mice with orthotopic Ovalbumin-expressing Lewis lung carcinomas (LLC-Ova), including Ova-specific immunity and effects on tumor growth. Immunity and tumor growth in a KRAS transgenic mutant model will also be studied. (2) Study anti-tumor DC and T cell functions in ex-vivo preparations from lung carcinoma bearing mice with DC-specific alterations in HS biosynthesis. DC maturation, antigen presentation, and the capacity of DCs from LLC-Ova tumors grown in DC-targeted HS mutants to activate Ova-sensitized T cells will be examined, as will tumor-cytolytic capacity of CD8+ T cells isolated from DLNs of tumor-bearing mutant vs control mice. Studies will also include the effects of mutation on DLN colonization by plasmacytoid DCs and their functional capacity. (3) Assess chemokine-receptor interactions and signaling mechanisms in the setting of DC-targeted alterations in HS biosynthesis; and the effects of novel HS inhibitors on tumor growth and immunity. We will study how HS mutation affects DC-surface binding of lymphatic chemokines CCL21, CXCL12, or CX3CL1 to cognate receptors. The effect of HS mutation on DC migration and maturation signaling in response to chemokine will be assessed, including the activation of pDCs through novel TLR-dependent mechanisms. Finally, we will study how novel HS inhibitors affect signaling by tumor DCs as well as lung carcinoma growth and immunity. This work examines novel mechanisms whereby altering trafficking and maturation of tumor DCs may effectively re-program endogenous anti-tumor immunity. The genetic target validation and rational introduction of glycan-targeting inhibitors may guide new therapies to achieve immune eradication of human lung cancer."

"9542508","Candida is the major fungal pathogen of humans, causing diseases that range from oral and vaginal candidiasis to life-threatening candidemia and invasive disease. The Candida research community focuses on a broad spectrum of subjects that relate to epidemiology, drug resistance, infection, host response, and therapeutics. The biennial Candida and Candidiasis Conference is the premier forum for presentation of cutting-edge advances and the latest perspectives in these diverse areas. Funds are requested for partial support for the 14th Conference on Candida and Candidiasis, to be held April 15 - 19, 2018, in Providence, RI. The conference is sponsored in part by the American Society for Microbiology, which provides both management expertise and financial support. The Program is based upon past conferences, which reliably draw approximately 300-350 U.S. and International scientists, and which have been met with consistent enthusiastic support in participant surveys.  The Program includes 17 sessions, with 5 or 6 speakers in each section. At least 65 of the talks will be selected based on submitted abstracts. Chairs for each session have been selected for their expertise in the subject area. This arrangement provides flexibility to present cutting-edge advances and to enlist a diverse spectrum of emerging and established speakers. Parallel sessions will address infection models, metabolic adaptation, fungal drug interactions and new technologies while encouraging productive interaction and discussion. ?Elevator talks? will allow junior scientists to summarize their poster in a few minutes on stage. Three afternoon poster sessions will allow discussion of the 250-350 posters. Clinical talks about the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of candidiasis will be incorporated into sessions that focus on key aspects of Candida infections, including environmental signaling, antifungal agents and resistance, and immune recognition. In a separate session on Candida case reports, clinicians will inform basic scientists about the challenges of diagnosing and treating different types of infection.  Our meeting has a strong track record of inclusion and, for example, 50% of confirmed session chairs in the current meeting are female. We are confident that we will meet the goals of the conference - to present the latest advances in the field, to spotlight achievements of junior scientists, and to ensure participation and promotion of diverse scientists, to promote synergistic and interdisciplinary interactions and to provide a venue for community-wide discussion."
"9559768","The goals of this K24 proposal are to train physician scientists in the conduct of patient -oriented research in Haiti and in Tanzania and to conduct a new study on urine metabolites for tuberculosis diagnosis in HIV- infected adults in Haiti (Aim 1).

"9618364","From parent R01 ? R01GM113001 Project Summary  A critical aspect of gonad development is the formation of the male and female gonad stem cell niches. Both germline and somatic stem cells are required for continuous production of differentiated progeny for gametogenesis, while their surrounding microenvironments, or ?niches?, control gonad stem cell division, maintenance, and their transition into differentiation. However, gonad stem cells and their niches are very different in males and females, with distinct regulatory control and very different outcomes (sperm vs. eggs). Further, in some species, such as mammals, a clear stem cell population exists only in males, but not in females, resulting in a more limited reproductive potential in females. This proposal aims to understand the mechanisms governing sex-specific development of the gonad stem cell niche. It addresses fundamental aspects of the biology of sex determination that also have clear implications for stem cell biology and human reproductive health.  Although the mechanisms that initiate sex determination vary tremendously in different animal species, it is now appreciated that a single family of transcription factors, the ?Doublesex, Mab3 Related Transcription Factors? (DMRTs), controls sexual dimorphism in the gonads of most or all animal species, including flies and humans. How these transcription factors dictate the differences between male and female gonad stem cell niches is not yet understood. In this proposal, we will investigate how the founding member of the DMRT family, Drosophila doublesex (dsx), controls sexual dimorphism in the gonad stem cell niche."
"9543625","Access to biological samples is crucial to the research process that leads to diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines to address new and reemerging infectious diseases. However, access to biological samples has become a barrier to research. With respect to researchers based in the U.S. alone, a series of legal agreements reached at the international level erect barriers to access for viruses including Ebola, influenza, and Zika. With respect to international research collaborations, material transfer agreements are becoming more complex and increasingly necessitate the involvement of investigators. Despite these changes, a distinction remains between the role of researchers and the role of lawyers who negotiate MTAs. This conference idea arose based on the importance of minimizing barriers to access of biological samples and related knowledge from genetic resources originating in developing countries. Most researchers have little or no involvement with the material transfer process even though their interests are at stake. The fact that the material transfer process has become more integral and high-stakes in the process leading to diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines to address new and reemerging infectious diseases is reason to create this multidisciplinary meeting. This meeting has 5 overall objectives: (1) Gather infectious disease specialists with experts in the ethics and law of biological sampling, biobanking, and material transfer, (2) Develop multidisciplinary research as a vehicle to advance understanding of the changing role of the material transfer agreement especially as affected by the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization, (3) Provide opportunities to seed multidisciplinary collaborations among investigators, trainees, ethicists, and legal scholars, (4) Support trainee education about challenges arising from material transfer agreements and the role of investigators in addressing those challenges, and (5) Catalyze new dialogues on the structure of international scientific collaborations in light of constraints imposed by the ethics and law of sampling, biobanking, and transfer. The conference organizers include: Dr. Rebecca Katz who has had experience at multiple levels of national and international conferences including organizing meetings related to the International Health Regulations, Ebola response and pandemic preparedness in Geneva, Washington, DC and Wilton Park, UK. Professor Sam Halabi has previous experience organizing programs for one-week intensive programs aimed at multidisciplinary participants from developed and developing countries as well as many local conferences. There are few if any conferences that have attempted to bring together expertise in medicine/science, law, and ethics around the issue of material transfer as it has changed in the last decade. Without a meeting of this nature, the targeted groups of researchers would have a low likelihood of developing collaborations. This conference will act as an enzyme to catalyze those interactions in order to advance science and access to new diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines."
"9442864","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and a top cause of serious long-term disability. A number of stroke risk factors have been established at the individual-level; however, these risk factors only partially explain stroke risk and account for only half of the racial disparities in stroke. Novel exposures of stroke risk must be identifie to improve our understanding of stroke risk and to develop effective interventions. Recently, built and social environments (BSEs) have been identified as important factors to examine to further our understanding of cardiovascular disease. However, to date no studies have examined the effect of BSEs on stroke risk. BSEs may also help to explain the large racial and geographic disparities in stroke rates although this has yet to be empirically examined nationally. The proposed study would address these gaps by utilizing a unique assembled cohort, namely the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. The REGARDS cohort is a national sample of adults over age 45, with oversamples of African-American participants and persons in the stroke belt. The proposed study will expand the REGARDS study to examine the effects of BSEs on incident stroke risk and on racial and geographic disparities in stroke. These aims will be achieved by obtaining data on a broad range of BSE characteristics of the REGARDS participants' built environment (e.g., food availability, park availability, food prices, physical activity facility availability, land use, steet connectivity and neighborhood physical environment) and participants' social environment (objective crime, perceived crime, neighborhood SES, social cohesion, racial residential segregation, social support and social networks, and neighborhood social environment). The data will be obtained from a number of sources including secondary commercial and administrative sources, participant self-reports and primary audits using the Street View feature in Google Earth. Environmental data will be spatially linked to participant data of the REGARDS case-cohort study. The proposed study aims to 1) examine the extent to which BSEs contribute to incident stroke risk in the REGARDS study; and 2) determine the extent to which BSEs explain racial and geographic disparities in incident stroke. The proposed study builds on important preliminary studies and the extensive relevant experience of the investigative team, which includes prominent scholars across a number of institutions. The proposed research provides a cost-effective way to examine the importance of BSEs for stroke prevention across diverse community settings and racial groups. Identifying the BSE characteristics that are predictive of incident stroke and BSEs that contribute to racial and geographic disparities will help inform future modifications of environments to improve population health. At the end of the study period, the BSE data will be made available to others through the REGARDS data sharing protocols; thus the measures in the proposed study will be available to the greater scientific community for use in research pertaining to other disease outcomes."
"9653941","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Work-related injuries and illnesses (WRIIs) continue to be a significant public health problem in Massachusetts. Surveillance of WRII is essential to effectively allocate limited prevention resources and monitor progress in meeting prevention goals. Workers' compensation (WC) claim records are an important source of information about WRII sustained by workers across a range of industries, WRIIs, and worker populations. However, their utility in providing information for action to protect workers has yet to be fully realized. The overarching aim of the proposed project is to reduce the incidence of WRII among Massachusetts workers by maximizing the state's capacity to use available WC data to conduct surveillance and promote prevention. The intent is to create sustained improvements in the WC data system and develop methods to generate actionable information for preventing WRII on an ongoing basis. Specific Aims are to: 1) develop, implement, and document protocols for assigning standardized codes to key data elements, essential for surveillance; 2) compare use of alternative sources of statewide employment data in conjunction with WC claim data to generate statewide WRII rates and recommend the most appropriate denominator for ongoing use; and explore approaches to generating local area WRII rates to inform community health planning and practice; 3) prepare a technical evaluation report assessing completeness, usefulness and limitations of the current WC database and denominator data source, with recommendations for WC data system improvements; 4) analyze three years WC claim data and prepare and disseminate a descriptive report of WRII in Massachusetts that identifies health and safety priorities; and 5) increase opportunities for integrative WRII prevention and compensation research. This study will be a multi-agency effort of the Massachusetts Departments of Public Health (lead agency), Industrial Accidents and Labor Standards that leverages resources and expertise within each agency. These Departments have a successful history of working together to protect the health of Massachusetts workers; the state infrastructure for occupational safety and health will be further strengthened by this new collaboration. An interagency study research team will be established. The work will be guided by an advisory group of nationally recognized WC experts and input from the Massachusetts Occupational Health and Safety Team (MOHST) an interagency working group that coordinates activities to improve worker health and safety in the state."
"9468051","Project Summary: Collagen is continuously degraded and remodeled as well as produced in both health and fibrotic disease. Our laboratory has demonstrated that the intracellular pathway of collagen uptake and degradation is tightly regulated. In mouse models, the intracellular pathways of collagen degradation have been shown to be important in modulating pulmonary fibrosis. However, the specific mechanisms that regulate collagen internalization and degradation in cells remain incompletely elucidated. Currently, there are no therapies that target these pathways to modulate and augment degradation of fibrotic tissue even though this would have a significant impact on patients with established fibrotic disease. Our laboratory previously published an RNAi- based screen of drosophila phagocytes that identified promising candidate genes that may regulate collagen uptake in mammals including Cell division cycle 7 (CDC7) kinase. The knockdown of this gene led to increased collagen uptake in multiple in vitro systems and this also corresponded with increased expression of a canonical collagen endocytic receptor. These findings raise the interesting possibility that regulatory mechanisms exist that inhibit collagen degradation and these could be exploited to treat fibrosis. Based on these findings, the proposed studies are designed to explore (1) how CDC7 regulates collagen endocytic machinery and (2) whether inhibition of the CDC7 pathway regulates collagen turnover in vivo both at the cellular level and in accelerating the resolution of experimental fibrosis in a well-established murine model. We anticipate that these experiments will expand our understanding of matrix biology and provide the foundation for the design of therapies that could treat human disease."
"9447768","Corneal scarring from ocular trauma is a major cause of blindness in veterans, active military personnel and civilians affecting 1.5 million Americans each year. Presently, over 167,000 Veterans are legally blind, 1.5 million suffer significantly compromised vision, and >7000 veterans are becoming blind each year. The annual cost for treating blindness in America is $139 billion. Current therapies offer short-term relief, cause multiple side effects and often fails to treat preexisting corneal scars for which corneal transplant surgery is a standard of care. With current funding we have successfully identified potentially the first non-surgical therapy to cure pre-existing corneal scars in vivo, uncovered epigenetic mechanisms regulating corneal fibrosis, established novel single and 2-gene therapies to block myofibroblast formation, characterized novel TGF? DNA-binding proteins, developed a canine in vivo corneal fibrosis model, and identified many newer molecular targets, genes, and drugs to control corneal fibrosis or thinning as evident from 22 publications. Our central hypothesis is that nanoparticle-mediated gene therapy offers long-term relief from corneal blindness without significant side effects and long-term goal remains the development of innovative bench- to-bedside translational nanomedicine approaches to cure pre- and post-corneal scarring in vivo. This project tests 5 novel hypotheses formulated into 3 independent aims: 1) Tests the hypothesis that PEI2- GNPs-mediated Id3 gene (Inhibitor of differentiation) delivery into rabbit stroma will limit transdifferentiation of stromal fibroblast to myofibroblast (a key mechanism causing undesirable wound healing and fibrosis) in the cornea in vivo by disrupting the binding of E-proteins to the promoter of ?-smooth muscle actin (TGF? downstream target gene). 2) Tests 2 hypotheses that (a) PEI2-GNPs-delivered localized HGF+BMP7 gene therapy eliminates preexisting corneal scarring in vivo via mechanisms in which HGF eradicates corneal scarring by selective apoptosis in myofibroblasts and BMP7 prevents re-emergence of new wound healing due to death of established myofibroblasts by counterbalancing profibrotic Smads and (b) HGF+BMP7 delivery into stroma does not compromise characteristic collagen fibrillogenesis required for corneal clarity, maintains normal corneal homeostasis, and is safe to the eye in vivo. 3) Tests 2 novel hypotheses (a) stromal fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblast proceeds via ?-smooth muscle actin (TGF?1 downstream target gene) and is tightly controlled by the co-repressor (5'-TG-3'-interacting factor (TGIF)1, TGIF2, and SnoN) and co-activator (CBP and p300), and (b) the transdifferentiation process can be arrested by the over-expression of identified co-repressor or silencing of co-activator efficiently in vivo in a rabbit model. Successful completion of the proposed research fills critical knowledge gaps and significantly improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating corneal wound healing, lead development of novel nanomedicine approaches for corneal blindness and significantly advances the fibrosis research field."
"9615097","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe form of acute lung injury that is one of the most frequent causes of admission into the intensive care unit. Few therapeutic options are available, and mortality is high. Supportive therapy with supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation are essential, but additional injury can be caused by the ventilator, termed ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Epithelial repair is critical for disease resolution and survival, but we have limited knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of repair and how mechanical stretch impacts these mechanisms. The long term objective of this project is to increase our understanding of the mechanisms of epithelial repair and how overdistention of pulmonary epithelial cells contributes to VILI and maladaptive repair mechanisms. We previously identified an autocrine role for the chemokine CXCL12 in alveolar epithelial repair involving its receptor CXCR4. We now have preliminary data showing that patients with CAP-induced ARDS that had high levels of CXCL12 in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and lower mortality. Based upon additional preliminary data, we propose that CXCR4 interacts with a complex of signaling molecules including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) that regulates epithelial repair. The central hypothesis of this application is that CXCL12 promotes epithelial repair, but mechanical stretch causes disruption of CXCR4-FAK-ASK1 signaling that inhibits cell spreading, migration, and repair. We will first examine whether CXCL12 is a biomarker for ARDS patients undergoing adaptive repair by measuring CXCL12 in banked samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma. In addition we will use autopsy samples from ARDS patients to evaluate expression of CXCR4 and phosphorylated (activated) ASK1. In the second aim we will investigate the interactions between CXCR4, FAK, and ASK1 during recovery from lung injury caused by LPS as a model of pneumonia. We will use mice with conditional deletion of CXCR4 in lung epithelial as well as ASK1 knockout mice. We will also examine the biochemical interactions of these signaling molecules in cultured alveolar epithelial cells in a scratch wound model. In the third aim we will investigate how high stretch mechanical ventilation or cyclic stretch of cultured cells disrupts these signaling pathways during repair in  combined model of pneumonia (LPS) and mechanical ventilation. These studies will elucidate new signaling pathways involved in alveolar epithelial repair and how mechanical stretch disrupts the repair processes."
"9451491","We propose a set of studies focused on the association of suicide with neuroinflammation and compromise of the blood-brain barrier, with the goal of identifying a pattern of quantifiable abnormalities that could serve as a biomarker for imminent suicidal risk in our Veterans. Autopsy studies are uniquely suited to do this, because they capture the state of the brain at the time of the suicidal act.  Findings from our laboratories and others indicate that susceptibility to suicide includes inflammatory activation in the brain and systemically, accompanied by compromised integrity of the blood-brain barrier: (1) Most directly, we reported increased densities of microglia or other phagocytic cells associated with blood vessels in dorsal prefrontal white matter of people who died by suicide, Similar results are reported in cingulate white matter. (2) Studies of brains from individuals who died by suicide and studies of blood and CSF from live individuals who had previously attempted suicide found elevations of inflammatory cytokines. (3) Various infectious diseases are associated with increased risk of suicide, as is a history of hospitalization for any infection. (4) Laboratory animals exposed to stress show elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, behavioral abnormalities, and activation of microglia. (5) We have reported an association of suicide with a polymorphism and decreased frontal and cingulate transcripts for CD44, which is involved in the normal function of the BBB. (6) Biochemical measures suggesting BBB impairment are reportedly associated with attempted suicide and with suicidal ideation. (7) In MDD subjects who died by suicide, compared with nonpsychiatric non-suicide cases, we found differential methylation of genes associated with cell death, both in whole cortical homogenates and in purified neuronal fractions. We also found significantly lower methylation in the promoter of the gene for CCL3, a powerful inflammatory cytokine synthesized by microglia and astrocytes and an attractant for microglia and white blood cells, but this difference was not present in the purified neuronal fraction.  Taken together, these findings lead us to hypothesize a suicidal state characterized by impaired BBB function, elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and abnormalities in DNA methylation of genes stimulating inflammation, all of which can be assessed in live individuals. To confirm this phenotype, we propose three specific aims, each employing the same set of 90 autopsy brains, already collected. In order to distinguish features of suicide from those of psychiatric illness, we employ a 3-group design with 30 cases of psychiatric disease and suicide, 30 cases of psychiatric disease without suicide, and 30 cases with neither psychiatric disease nor suicide, all from a well-characterized collection with a single collection protocol at a single autopsy service. To optimize our ability to distinguish features of suicide from those of psychiatric disease, in addition to finding the best matches between groups by age and sex, we sought to limit all of the psychiatric cases to a single clinical group, which was best achieved with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Our specific aims, for each of which we will assay cerebral cortex and white matter from dorsal and ventral prefrontal regions, are: (1) To evaluate functional BBB impairment by stereological assessment of perivascular deposits of fibronectin. (2) To quantify a panel of cytokines, and to look for structural evidence of BBB impairment by assaying isolated microvessel fractions for vascular tight junction proteins and matrix metalloproteases.(3) To identify transcriptional correlates of BBB alterations with a genome-wide methylation survey on microvessel fractions of cortex and white matter from each region, using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray .These data will allow us to establish the underlying abnormalities for development of a suicidal profile to better, identify and treat veterans at risk of suicide. Knowledge and application of this profile will save Veterans? lives by identifying potential targets for novel clinical interventions."

"9444961","Project Summary  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects ~15% of the U.S. population. Although a broad range of insults initiate kidney injury, fibrosis is a hallmark of all forms of progressive CKD. In spite of advances in delineating pathways that contribute to kidney fibrosis, there are no specific treatments for this serious disorder.  TGF-? signaling is a central mediator of fibrosis in multiple tissues making it an attractive therapeutic target. However, because these cytokines have a wide range of roles in human physiology and pathology, the challenge has been to find a therapeutic strategy that is selective for the diseased target tissue to improve efficacy and safety profiles. A promising approach is to disrupt TGF-? activation in the injured tissue. TGF-? is secreted as a latent, inactive complex that is sequestered in high concentrations in the extracellular matrix. A critical step in the regulation of TGF-? signaling is activation of the latent complex by binding of alpha v (?v) integrins to lysine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motifs. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will determine if a novel small molecule RGD peptidomimetic inhibitor of TGF-? activation will reduce kidney fibrosis in mouse models of nephrotoxicity, ischemia and urinary tract obstruction. Our preliminary studies indicated that this compound is safe and effective and thus a highly promising candidate for future translational studies in patients.  Developing effective treatments for kidney disease requires increased knowledge about molecular mechanisms that drive progressive fibrosis of the organ. Myofibroblasts, derived from peri-vascular mesenchymal progenitor cells are the principal source of extracellular matrix deposition in organ fibrosis. However, the cellular and molecular pathways that control the formation of these cells in response to injury are not well understood. In Aim 2, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which alpha v (?v) integrins regulate the proliferation and differentiation of myofibroblasts after injury.  These pre-clinical studies will advance knowledge about mechanisms of organ fibrosis and have the potential to identify a novel therapeutic strategy to treat chronic kidney disease in veterans."
"9540297","Interferon (IFN) induction and signaling is an early antiviral response that can be triggered by viral double- stranded (ds)RNA. While critical to limiting viral replication and spread, overexpression of the IFN response can be detrimental to human health. For example, Aicardi-Goutiéres syndrome (AGS) is a severe autoimmune, neurodevelopmental and inflammatory disease, caused by mutation of any of several genes involved in IFN production and signaling, characterized by excessive IFN (primarily IFN-?) production and signaling in the absence of virus infection. Mutation of the ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) gene is one cause of AGS. ADAR1 destabilizes dsRNA, and mutations in the ADAR1 gene lead to accumulation of endogenous self-dsRNA and as a consequence chronic induction of IFN and other cytokines, leading to cell death and damage primarily to the central nervous system (CNS) and the skin. Studies in mouse models have shown that Adar1 knockout (KO) is embryonic lethal and can be rescued by KO of genes encoding proteins involved in IFN production (MDA5 or MAVS). However the downstream activities mediating lethality have not been identified nor have the pathological effects of Adar1 KO in the CNS been addressed in these mouse model systems. Thus, there is a gap in our understanding of where the IFN is generated, in the periphery and/or the CNS and in which cell types and how IFN signaling promotes CNS pathology. We recently found that the potent antiviral oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-ribonuclease (RNase) L pathway is induced by self-dsRNA in the absence of ADAR1 in uninfected human lung epithelial derived A549 cells and importantly that activation of RNase L is a dominant pathway leading to cell death. Moreover, we found that ADAR1 KO is also lethal in A549 cells and that lethality can be rescued by KO of RNase L or by MAVS. These data suggest that RNase L activity may play a role in promoting cell death and CNS damage in AGS patients and/or in mouse models. We will utilize our expertise in IFN response during neurotropic coronavirus infection in a mouse model and our recent findings on endogenous dsRNA induction of RNase L in human A549 cells to test the following hypothesis : In the absence of Adar1 gene expression, endogenous dsRNA induces IFN in the periphery and/or in the CNS, leading to an IFN signaling response and activation of RNase L resulting in cell death and CNS pathology. We will use a novel approach centered on tamoxifen inducible Adar1 KO in Adar1fl/flERT2Cre mice and cell type specific Adar1 KO mice to ablate Adar1 expression in vitro in primary CNS cell cultures and in vivo in mice. We will 1) compare cytokine production, RNase L activation and cell death in primary murine CNS cells as well as myeloid cells following Adar1 ablation in vitro and 2) investigate the role of the blood brain barrier and the cell type specific role of ADAR1 in controlling CNS pathogenesis in vivo. These findings will contribute toward understanding the impact of endogenous dsRNA in promoting CNS pathology and in the long term will aid in identifying targets for therapy of AGS."
"9465907","Project Summary/Abstract Epithelial cells are a critical first line of defense against pathogens such as influenza and strategies to modulate epithelial cell signaling are therefore an appealing target for novel therapeutics. We have previously identified protein kinase D (PKD) as a key regulator of bronchial epithelial barrier integrity during viral infection and have recently identified PKD as a mediator of airway epithelial chemokine secretion. We hypothesize that stimulation with the double-stranded RNA polyI:C or Influenza A virus (IAV) infection leads to activation of PKD (specifically the PKD3 isoform) which increases epithelial chemokine release and promotes leukocyte recruitment. This project aims to determine the mechanism between PKD3 activity and epithelial human interleukin-8 (IL-8)/ murine chemokine CXCL1 secretion. To test this aim, we will assay PKD3 activity (substrate phosphorylation) following siRNA-mediated knock-down of potential receptors upstream PKD activation, and then use that information to inform identification of the adaptor molecule(s) associated with PKD (using co-immunoprecipitation). We will also assay IL-8/CXCL1 mRNA levels in human and mouse airway epithelial cell lines following knock-down of PKD isoforms to determine the isoform driving chemokine production. We will then use chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify PKD-activated transcription factors involved in IL-8/CXCL1 transcription and confirm activity with luciferase reporter assay. We further aim to investigate the therapeutic potential of PKD3 reduction/inhibition to attenuate lung injury following IAV infection. To test this aim, we will infect PKD3 deficient mice (PKD3-/-) with sub-lethal influenza A virus (IAV) and assay for leukocyte infiltration (via flow cytometry), chemokine secretion (via ELISA and multiplex array), and general pathology (histology). We will also generate bone marrow chimeric mice to assess the relative contributions of PKD3 in stromal cells vs. hematopoietic cells to lung injury and neutrophilia. We hypothesize that stimulation with the double-stranded RNA polyI:C or Influenza A virus (IAV) infection leads to activation of the PKD3 isoform which increases epithelial pro-inflammatory cytokine release and promotes leukocyte recruitment. We further hypothesize that PKD3 may play a previously unsuspected role in regulating airway epithelial anti-viral immune responses and that further study of the mechanism of PKD3-mediated cytokine release in the airway epithelium may lead to new therapeutics in combating viral respiratory infections."
"9424690","Abstract Myocardial infarction (MI) is caused by lack of adequate blood flow to the heart and results in terminal loss of cardiomyocytes (CM). MI and its related complications are a leading cause of death worldwide. The search for regenerative therapy that can repair or replace lost CM remains a daunting challenge. The foremost issue is the difficulty in procuring viable replacement cells. Heterologous sources are unattractive due to the potential for immunorejection. Harvesting progenitor cells from a patient's damaged heart is invasive and poses severe risks. Reprogramming somatic cells from other autologous sources can result in very low yields due to genetic or epigenetic barriers. A series of recent studies, however, has revealed that masseter muscle derived progenitor (MMP) cells share a common origin and have overlapping gene expression patterns with heart muscle. MMP can be isolated from highly accessible masseter muscles without mandible motor dysfunction and our preliminary data has shown that MMP yield the highest rate of CM differentiation as compared with limb muscle progenitors. Importantly, MMP can give rise to functional CM phenotypes including ventricular, atrial, and pacemaker CM under defined conditions. Therefore, MMP represent an ideal therapeutic candidate to maximize cardiogenic differentiation efficiency after cell transplantation in order to repopulate an infarcted heart region with a supply of autologous CM. At the same time, MMP avoid the common pitfalls associated with immunorejection, tumor formation, and reversion to an alternative epigenetic precursor. Aim 1 consists of in vitro studies to isolate and characterize MMP (including developmental origin, surface markers, and proliferation potential) in order to gain the desired CM population using novel sorting approaches. Aim 2 is designed to determine the mechanism by which microRNAs and transcription factor networks mediate the lineage commitments of MMP and the underlying cardiac potential of MMP as regulated by miR-128. Finally, Aim 3 focuses on the effects of implantation of MMP-derived cell sheets on the cardiac functions in mouse and porcine MI models. Experiments will examine the in vivo cell fate of MMP and determine any beneficial effects that result from cell engraftment and functional integration under ischemic conditions. These studies will provide new insights in both basic heart developmental biology and cell-based regenerative medicine. This approach holds great promise for the emerging field of personalized medicine and strongly supports the possibility that autologous MMP harvested from human masseter muscles and expanded in vitro will serve as a major source of CM that will be highly effective for treatment of patients after MI."
"9440422","Abstract: Subcortical pathology is a common feature in aging, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia but has been challenging to study with micron resolution in vivo. Optical methods such as two-photon microscopy image the superficial cortex at the micron-scale, but the resolution of these conventional microscopic methods degrades rapidly beyond 600 microns imaging depth. Standard whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods do not yet provide cellular-level resolution and are expensive. Thus, there is a pressing need for methods to assess deep cortical and subcortical perfusion and cellular injury at the microscopic level, thus bridging the gap between existing superficial optical microscopy and macroscopic imaging. This proposal will develop, validate, and demonstrate advanced optical microscopy methods for longitudinal imaging of subcortical structures in the mouse brain using 2200 nm Optical Coherence Microscopy. 2200 nm imaging, in which tissue scattering is reduced by 2.5× and 1.5× compared to 1300 nm and 1700 nm, respectively, will enhance the delivery of ballistic (as opposed to multiply-scattered) photons to the focal spot, and enhance the proportion of photons backscattered from the focus that are detected without further scattering. Both of these benefits will substantially improve the signal localization, spatial resolution and signal-to background ratio when imaging deep in the brain. These methods will push penetration depths further into the living mouse brain, imaging subcortical structures (i.e. hippocampal proper and dentate gyrus) and pathology at higher resolutions than were previously possible."
"9623452","Project Summary Influenza A virus (IAV) and secondary bacterial infections (SBI) are responsible for a significant number of illnesses and deaths each year. Management of these diseases is difficult, in part due to a lack of understanding of complex interplay of host-pathogen interactions. To advance the goal of developing effective therapeutics, new microbiologic tools that can assess how host immune responses work to limit viral burden and enhance bacterial invasion quantitative detail is essential. This grant aims to address the gap in biological knowledge of IAV and SBIs by exploiting predictive mathematical models that are calibrated and subsequently validated with quantitative experimental data. The proposed studies integrate rigorous kinetic modeling with targeted experimental studies to: (1) quantify the killing of virus-infected cells to explain a plateau-shaped viral peak and a rapid viral decline, and determine if the killing is density dependent and how CD8+ T cells contribute to viral decay; (2) quantify the production of IFN-?/?s from epithelial cells and immune cells during influenza to explain a double peak in IFN-? and a sustained plateau of IFN-?, and determine how they function to limit virus infection; (3) identify how AMs become depleted during influenza by quantifying their decay, and determine how viral loads and SBIs are altered by the loss of these cells. In each of these studies, we will develop and analyze mechanistic mathematical models together with quantitative infection data, test specific model predictions experimentally, and use the generated data to refine and extend the models. This iterative model-driven experimental approach will result in a detailed and quantitative understanding of the immune responses to influenza and how these contribute to viral-bacterial coinfection pathogenicity. This investigative approach is key to understanding the complex feedbacks in immune responses and in viral-bacterial interactions and reveal new targets for treatment and prevention of influenza and related bacterial infections."
"9461982","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     1) Background: Schizophrenia is a devastating illness that costs the US over $60 billion per year, mainly due to unemployment, lost productivity, and other consequences of poor functioning. Vocational rehabilitation programs such as Supported Employment (SE) improve psychosocial functioning. However, less than 1/4 of the patients at our facility with a schizophrenia-related diagnosis participate in SE despite its availability. We have developed a new integrated Cognitive Behavior Therapy (iCBT) group therapy protocol designed for low functioning patients with schizophrenia to improve motivation and engagement in psychosocial rehabilitation programs like SE.  2) Objectives: The objective of the current proposal is to evaluate whether iCBT can improve engagement and success in an existing SE program among the most functionally disabled patients with schizophrenia. Our primary specific aim is to determine whether iCBT + SE will significantly improve work outcomes at post- treatment to a greater extent than Psychoeducation (PE) + SE in low functioning patients with schizophrenia.  Our secondary aims are to evaluate the whether iCBT + SE will significantly improve work outcomes at 6  month follow-up relative to PE + SE, and whether iCBT + SE will improve functional outcomes post-treatment  and at follow-up relative to PE + SE.  3) Research Design: We are proposing a prospective randomized controlled trial with participants recruited from the Philadelphia VA Medical Center (PVAMC). We will randomize 96 patients (48 patients per condition).  Assessors will be blinded to participant treatment group allocation. Assessment sessions will occur at baseline, and at 6, 12, and 18 months.  4) Methodology: The study inclusion criteria are as follows: 1) Diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective  disorder, 2) Severe functional disability, 3) At least 90 days since last hospitalization, 4) Receiving treatmen at  PVAMC, 5) Minimal engagement in psychiatric rehabilitation services, 6) Ages 18-65, 7) Proficient in English,  8) Able to give informed consent. Exclusion criteria are: 1) Neurologic disease or damage that would make the diagnosis of schizophrenia questionable, 2) Current opioid or stimulant dependence. Patients in the iCBT condition will receive weekly or twice weekly group sessions for 12 months. iCBT follows a treatment manual  developed by Perivoliotis, Grant, & Beck. The manual details the approach (engagement, behavioral activation, cognitive remediation/restructuring, maintenance) and individualized treatment planning. It also describes strategies and techniques to deal with positive and negative symptoms, mood symptoms, and suicidality. It incorporates cognitive remediation strategies.33 Patients assigned to PE will receive weekly or twice weekly group sessions for 12 months. PE follows an evidence-based model already being delivered at the PVAMC.  Patients in both conditions will participate in the existing SE program at PVAMC. All participants will continue to receive any services (medical, psychiatric, case management) they were already receiving. The primary outcome measure will be the total score on the Work Behavior Inventory (WBI) at the end of treatment.  Secondary outcomes measures will be total score of the WBI at follow up and the total score on the Specific Levels of Functioning inventory (SLOF) measured at post-treatment and 6 month follow-up."
"9613985","Project Summary-Abstract  Organisms living on Earth have to cope with daily changes in their environment. The circadian clock is an endogenous oscillator, with a period of approximately 24 hours, which enables organisms to coordinate metabolism, physiology, and development in anticipation of diurnal and seasonal environmental changes therefore enhancing their fitness. The intricate network underlying the circadian oscillator at the molecular level has long been thought to rely on interlocked transcriptional-translational feedback loops. However, additional layers of regulation at the cellular and organismal level are required to explain the complex behavior of the system. To unravel this wiring and elucidate the role of key clock components, in this proposal we plan to combine a set of biochemical, genetic, functional genomic, and bioinformatic approaches.  TOC1 is an essential player in the core oscillator and recent work in our laboratory suggests that it can bind to RNA. By solving the atomic structure of TOC1 we seek to dissect its molecular properties. This will be instrumental to comprehend its regulatory mechanism and its function maintaining plant rhythmicity and regulating the expression of output genes. GI is also an oscillator component required for the proper ticking of the circadian clock and acts as a key regulatory hub directly connecting the clock to a plethora of physiological processes. To investigate the pivotal role of GI in the regulation of output pathways we propose to uncover and characterize its interactome network through molecular, genetic and proteomic analyses. These results will shed light on its regulatory function in key physiological processes providing important advances in our understanding of how the circadian clock impacts plant development. Finally, it has been recently revealed that the plant clock might have a central oscillator, similar to the mammalian system, able to coordinate peripheral clocks. To examine the organization of the plant circadian system, we will perform a genome-wide tissue- specific expression analysis with exceptional spatio-temporal resolution, complementing it with a phenotypical characterization. Altogether, the approach outlined here will expand our understanding of tissue and organ specific clocks and their architecture to regulate physiological and developmental processes. The knowledge gained from this proposal will contribute to develop a comprehensive view of the circadian clock as a network expanding from the molecule to the organismal level. This concept can be combined with insights from other organisms to improve our interpretation of circadian biology, ultimately impacting research in human health and circadian associated disorders."
"9419207","Many studies, including some by the PI, reveal that cumulative risk - simultaneous exposure to multiple environmental, psychological, and biological risks - resulting from poverty leads to pervasive emotional and physical health problems as early as infancy. However, there remains a critical knowledge gap as to whether the effects of poverty and cumulative risk originate before birth. We propose that prenatal exposure to cumulative risk is a key pathway by which the adverse effects of poverty are transmitted to fetuses during gestation. Moreover, this prenatal exposure to cumulative risk may also perturb a mother?s neural adaptation to parenting, which further increases the infant?s likelihood of receiving harsh parenting postnatally. The proposed study is innovative because it utilizes a unique intergenerational and prospective design. In a total of 200 pregnant women (110 low-income and 90 middle-income), cumulative prenatal risk will be assessed in each trimester (12, 22, and 32 weeks gestation). Shortly after the infant?s birth, neuroimaging of the infant and the mother will be performed to assess fetal brain development (using MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI) and maternal neural adaptation to parenting during pregnancy (using fMRI). The overall objective of the proposed study is to identify the prenatal pathways by which poverty perturbs neural outcomes of two generations - infants and their mothers. To achieve this objective, we will pursue three Aims. Aim#1 - Identify the relations between poverty and cumulative prenatal risk. We propose that lower family income is associated with cumulative risk in environmental (stressful life events, poor quality home environment), psychological (perceived stress, negative mood) and biological (elevated cortisol, reduced oxytocin) systems during pregnancy. Aim#2 - Identify the relations among poverty, cumulative prenatal risk, and brain morphology and connectivity in newborns. We propose that lower family income is associated with reduced volume, white matter integrity, and functional connectivity among the neural stress circuit of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex among newborns. Cumulative prenatal risk mediates the link between low income and newborn neural outcomes. Aim#3 - Identify the relations among poverty, cumulative prenatal risk, and neural adaptation to parenting in new mothers. We propose that cumulative prenatal risk mediates the links between family income and altered neural function for parental motivation and emotion regulation among new mothers. The proposed research is significant because it can offer scientific evidence to support prenatal intervention to reduce exposure to cumulative risk among low-income pregnant women. Compared to postnatal interventions with either mothers or infants, prenatal intervention is more effective and economical since it can potentially prevent poverty?s adverse effects in both generations by intervening with mothers only, prenatally. Furthermore, the current study will lay the groundwork for a new investigator?s research program for following a cohort of infants and their mothers starting from the first trimester of pregnancy to later developmental periods."
"9393980","A Pediatric Clinical Center for Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity (MoTrPAC): Towards a Molecular Map of Exercise in the Pediatric Origins of Health Across the Lifespan The goals of this research are to: 1) map the molecular mechanisms through which exercise benefits health in children and adolescents, a critical period of change in the human phenotype, and 2) provide the MoTrPAC consortium with rigorously collected and reproducible data from exercise studies in children and adolescents. This proposal is based on exciting discoveries in a range of disciplines, including: 1) new insights into age- dependent progression of gene expression during growth in children, 2) emerging data highlighting the central role played by leukocytes (n.b., an accessible tissue in child health research) in transducing exercise into health benefits, 3) pilot data showing remarkable interaction between the molecular transducers of growth and the molecular transducers of exercise, and 4) novel approaches to measuring and understanding physiologic and morphometric responses to acute and chronic exercise in children. In the proposed acute exercise studies, the immediate physiologic, proteomic, metabolomic, and leukocyte function and transcriptomic response to a brief exercise-induced perturbation in cellular homeostasis will be measured in a cross section of early- and late-pubertal boys and girls. In the proposed chronic exercise studies (a 12-week, prospective, aerobic exercise training intervention), we will compare the magnitude of the biomarker and molecular adaptation to training, along with the accompanying morphometric and physiologic changes between early- and late-pubertal girls and boys. The combined data from the acute and chronic exercise studies will be analyzed with systems- computational techniques to map the networks that transduce physical activity to health in the growing child and adolescent. Because phenotype is a ?moving target? during growth, we will use accurate methodologies (such as DXA for body composition and breath-by-breath gas exchange for cardiopulmonary exercise testing) that have proven in our hands to be feasible in large numbers of children and adolescents. Traditional exercise testing will be complemented by laboratory-based ?real-life? exercise protocols, and in all cases, scaled to each participant?s physical fitness, estimates of habitual physical activity, noninvasive measures of vascular health, and training volume and mode. In this way, the pediatric and adult data will be readily integrated. As an academic health center unit devoted uniquely to the study of physical activity and health in children in a very diverse region, our group is exceptionally qualified to contribute to the MoTrPAC consortium. We 1) published a series of discoveries of novel genomic and epigenetic exercise biomarkers in circulating leukocytes in both children and adults, 2) performed thousands of pediatric exercise tests, 3) conducted many successful prospective exercise training interventions in early and late pubertal children, and 4) were leaders in Project HEALTHY, the large NIH multicenter study to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes in children, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This research will ultimately enable child health professionals, families, and community leaders to optimize the use of exercise to promote health during a critical period of growth."
"9617136","    Summary Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is currently the subject of intense research interest, as it holds the promise to assist numerous patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders and other systemic and brain diseases. BCI systems allow users to interact with their environment without muscular control, by sensing and decoding the user's thoughts. Noninvasive BCI uses electroencephalography (EEG) to sense user's cognitive states; in EEG, scalp electrodes sense small potential changes arising from underlying neural activity. The effectiveness of BCI, however, depends critically upon training the user's cognitive abilities: users must learn to produce reliable patterns of brain activity that the BCI can decode from its sensors. Some users are able to complete this training with relative ease, but for others the learning process is difficult and lengthy. Thus, methods that can improve training promise to greatly enhance the usefulness of BCI in most applications, benefiting the many patients who may be aided with BCI technology. Mind-body awareness training (MBAT) has shown large effects upon both cognitive abilities and brain activity. MBAT emphasizes meditation practice that focuses on body states, and it has been shown to enhance factors that are most critical for sensorimotor- rhythm-based BCI: sustained attention, motor imagery, and generation of rhythmic neural signals. The general goal of the proposed research is to investigate whether and how experience with MBAT can improve subjects' ability to learn and use a sensorimotor-rhythm-based BCI. The specific aims of the proposed research are as follows: Aim 1: We will test whether MBAT training has significant impact on learning of BCI skills. We will study human subjects with various levels of MBAT experience and compare them with controls. Aim 2: We will use and further develop novel multimodal neuroimaging methods, along with extensive behavioral testing, to identify the neurocognitive components of MBAT that aid learning of BCI skills. Comprehensive analyses will combine imaging and neurocognitive results to identify brain regions responsible for the factors that produce improvement in BCI. The successful completion of the proposed research may allow MBAT training to become a best practice in BCI use, increasing BCI signal quality and reducing its training time. It will also better the understanding on how mind-body intervention works through innovative neuroimaging approaches. Understanding the neurocognitive basis of improvement may allow the production of enhanced training regimens, both with and without MBAT, including MBAT-like training specifically tailored to optimize BCI."
"9524509","Bronner, M.E.  In the early embryo, the neural plate border region contributes to diverse cell fates, ranging from neural crest cells and ectodermal placode cells to neurons of the central nervous system. Despite extensive studies of the neural crest and ectodermal placodes at post-neurula stages, surprisingly little is known about how these populations become distinct from one another within the early neural plate border. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that many neural plate border cells are multipotent as evidenced by their concomitant expression of markers characteristic of several fates. We will test this hypothesis by: 1) conducting a detailed analysis of the emerging neural plate border region by multiplex protein and gene expression profiling coupled with cell lineage analysis and 2) examining how perturbation of transcription factor levels affects expression profiles and lineage allocations of individual neural plate border cells. The significance of this proposal is that it will be the first to test how and when ectodermal placode precursors are segregated from neural crest and neural precursors at the neural plate border. The following aims will be performed: Aim 1: High resolution analysis of protein expression of neural plate, neural crest, placode and other  ectodermal markers in the neural plate border as a function of time. We will examine co-expression of  transcription factors associated with neural crest, placode, neural plate and ectodermal lineages  quantitatively and at single cell resolution in chick gastrula to neurula stages to determine their degree of  overlap and if/when a discrete separation occurs between them in the neural plate border. To take this to a  multiplex level, we will then perform single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis (smFISH) at  similar stages with 35 or more probes selected from known genes and new candidates from our single cell  RNA-seq dataset. Aim 2: Molecular dissection of regulatory interactions that mediate gene expression and cell fate  choice at the neural plate border. We will examine the consequence of perturbing individual transcription  factors (e.g. Pax7, Sox2, Six1) on expression of others neural plate border genes at the population and  single cell level. To examine inputs that regulate neural plate border formation, we will dissect novel  enhancers for Pax7, Six1 and other genes to determine direct regulatory inputs. Finally, we will examine  how balancing levels of transcription factors may influence other factors in the neural plate border region. Aim 3: Single cell lineage analysis of cells at the neural plate border. To definitively test whether  individual cells at the neural plate border have restricted or broad developmental potential, we will carry out  single cell lineage analysis by performing iontophoretic injection of lysinated rhodamine dextran into  individual neural plate border cells. We also will use enhancers for Pax7, Sox2, or Six1 as well as  photoconversion of individual cells to follow the long term fate of neural plate border cells and examine how  blocking individual transcription factors affects cell lineage allocation. 1"
"9444975","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic debilitating disease that is characterized by high titers of autoantibodies with specificity for nuclear autoantigens. It is considered to arise from interactions between underlying genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, with different combinations resulting in inter- individual variations in disease manifestations and therapeutic responsiveness. Directed therapeutic targeting of specific pathways has not proven effective, which suggests that the current understanding of pathogenesis is incomplete. The goal of the proposed project is to test the hypothesis that the survival of immature autoreactive B cells, the preferential development of antinuclear autoreactive B cells and the status of mature autoreactive B cells (immunocompetent vs. anergic/tolerogenic) is decided during the transitional stage 1 (T1) of development and requires constitutive T1 B cell expression of interferon ? (IFN?).  This paradigm shifting hypothesis is based on data generated using a combination of mixed-bone marrow chimeras, flow cytometry with tetramer or idiotype antibody selection, and high-throughput single-cell analysis to interrogate type I interferon (IFN) networks in B cell from patients with SLE and lupus-prone BXD2 mice. The data suggest that the currently known molecular and cellular aberrations are preceded by a single primary pathogenic event, i.e., production of IFN? by T1 B cells. The data suggest that the survival of the very early T1 cells is dependent on endogenous expression of IFN?. This subset of T1 B cells express endogenous IFN?, which leads to their development into T1 B cells that produce IFN?. The ability of T1 B cells to escape negative B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated selection is dictated by the type I IFN-determined responsiveness of this T1 subset to BCR-mediated signaling in combination with stimulation of TLR signaling (TLR7 or TLR9) by apoptotic debris. This preferentially permits escape of nucleic antigen-autoreactive B cells. We have further identified that the T1 B cell compartment contains distinct subsets of cells. As these included subsets with transcriptional profiles that parallel the phenotypes of mature and anergic suppressive regulatory (Breg) cells and their immunogenic counterparts that predominate in SLE, our new data suggest that this phenotypic switch in the mature B cells is imprinted during the T1 stage. These data also suggest that development of type I IFN network associated T1 B cells in BXD2 mice is associated with type I IFN-inducing transcription factors (IRF3 and IRF7) whereas induction of the Foxp3+ regulatory T1 B cells is associated with transcription factor, ID3.  Notably, these data not only suggest suppression of precursors of T1-Breg is a novel pathogenic framework in SLE but also provide the tool, i.e., the gene expression signatures in sorted transitional B cells, that enable its analysis. We will test the critical elements of our overall hypothesis through three Specific Aims that will: (1) Distinguish the roles of the constitutive IFN? signaling and the microenvironmental signals in driving the development of T1 B cells; (2) Identify if the initial T1 B cell transcriptional imprinting is maintained at the T2/MZP-MZ-FO stage of development; and (3) Determine if T1 B-cell endogenous IFN? promotes a type I IFN network that suppresses the precursors of regulatory B cells at the T1 stage in SLE patients. The scientific premises of the proposed work include the parallels between transcriptional profiles in the T1 B cells and mature B cells and the segregation of type I IFN associated vs Breg associated transcriptional profiles in the T1 B cells. We have acquired reporter mouse strains for IFN?, IL-10, Foxp3 and Id3 to interrogate discreet developmental stages within and derived from transitional T1 B subsets.  The information gained will have a broad-based impact on the field and improve the care of VA patients with SLE by identifying strategies to improve the efficacy of targeted biologic therapies together with non- invasive precision medicine guided-approaches."
"9414007","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cannabis is pervasively consumed in the United States, especially during adolescence with more than 20% of 12th graders using this drug within the past year. As youngsters increasingly use this substance - and as the debates regarding its safety and legal status ensue - understanding the long-term neurobiological consequences of early cannabis exposure is paramount. Human studies convincingly demonstrate an association between early cannabis exposure and neuropsychiatric diseases ranging from substance abuse disorder (or drug addiction) to schizophrenia. In fact, these diseases are linked with earlier, more frequent consumption suggesting a causal relationship between developmental cannabis exposure and future mental health. Consistent with these epidemiological findings, animals exposed to THC, the main psychoactive component of cannabis, exhibit elevated heroin self-administration. These findings indicate that neurobiological disturbances causally contribute to addiction vulnerability later in life. Alongside these behavioral changes, adolescent exposure to THC induces long-term transcriptional changes in nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region of the ventral striatum that regulates reward and reinforcement. Small non-coding miRNAs regulate gene expression and are themselves persistently impacted by adolescent THC exposure, suggesting that these regulatory mechanisms may contribute to the stable, long-term changes in mRNA expression and behavior. The primary goal of this proposal is to identify miRNAs that impact addiction vulnerability via their interaction with proenkephalin (Penk). a neuropeptide precursor induced by adolescent THC that causally mediates heroin self-administration in rats. Since Penk is enriched in a distinct pathway within the NAc, an innovative yet feasible approach to identify and separate these neurons is proposed, allowing for a focused, hypothesis-driven molecular and behavioral study within the relevant neurons. Adolescent exposure to THC increases Penk mRNA and peptide levels in the NAc medial shell, contributing to addiction vulnerability, and I hypothesize that cell type-specific alternations in miRNA contribute to these persistent transcriptional alternations. I further hypothesize that reversing these miRNA derangements in a cell-type specific manner will reduce heroin self-administration even in at-risk animals exposed to THC during adolescence. Findings based on these proposed experiments will increase our neurobiological understanding of addiction as a developmental process and will bring to focus the health-related consequences of early cannabis exposure."
"9449303","Blast exposure is a common experience of Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom/ Operation New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) Veterans. There is growing concern that repetitive blast exposure may be a risk factor for neurological disorders, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The pathogenic processes that link early-occurring, often transient brain injuries, to subsequent chronic behavioral and cognitive impairments are not well understood. The pathology underlying these impairments is poorly understood.  A number of important knowledge gaps currently impede progress toward elucidating the patho- physiology of repetitive blast-related mTBI that include, limited insight into the translational significance of the pathology produced in blast-induced animal TBI models with reference to neuroimaging findings in Veterans with blast-related mTBI. Moreover, the very limited neuropathological information from such Veterans significantly limits our understanding of blast-related mTBI.  Adding to the complexity of this issue numerous research groups have reported multiple forms of blast- induced pathology in a number of animal blast TBI models including: aberrant tau expression, reactive astrocytosis, microgliosis, axonal injury, myelin damage, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Much attention has been placed on tau because of its close association with sports-related CTE. Whether repetitive blast-related mTBI follows that same pathogenic pathway to CTE, which is defined chiefly by specific tau deposits, remains an open question.  However, recent findings call attention to prominent glial pathology in Veterans with blast-related mTBI, raising the possibility that this form of neurotrauma may represent a distinct class; or possibly a distinct pathogenic process leading to chronic mTBI (which also may involve tau pathology).  In repetitive blast exposed mice we have found microglial and astroglial pathology that, especially in subcortical regions of the brain, is quite similar to the white matter-associated glial pathology recently reported in Veterans with blast-related mTBI. We also have evidence that discrete microdomains of early-occurring BBB disintegrity are closely associated with aberrant microglial responses that include myelin phagocytosis, astrogliosis, and neuron loss. These data have prompted us test four closely related hypotheses: Specific Aim 1: will test the hypothesis that in blast exposed mice, specific brain regions are vulnerable to  early-occurring blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption; and that these disruptions may trigger later persistent  pathology associated with myelin disruption, as well as axonal and neuronal injury. Specific Aim 2: will test the hypothesis that in mice, white matter pathology involving glial-mediated myelin  phagocytosis and axonal injury will be closely associated with reduced fractional anisotropy. Specific Aim 3: will test the hypothesis that specific brain regions with myelin, axonal injury, and BBB disrupt-  tion in mice will correspond to DTl neuroimaging findings in similar brain regions in Veterans with blast-  related mTBI. Specific Aim 4: will test the hypothesis that neuropathology findings in brains from Veterans with blast-related  mTBI will be found in the same anatomical regions as those identified by neuroimaging in living Veterans and  will correspond with the pathology in blast-exposed mice.  Successful completion of these aims will: (i) facilitate progress toward understanding the pathogenic cascades leading to chronic behavioral and cognitive impairments in Veterans with blast-related mTBI; and (ii) refine the translational relevance of animal blast TBI models needed to improve their usefulness as tools to speed the search for strategies to treat and prevent chronic blast-related neurodegeneration."
"9418595","Project Summary Calcium oxalate kidney stone disease occurs in approximately 9 % of the U.S. population and contributes significantly to health care costs. Small reductions in urinary oxalate excretion are thought to limit stone risk. Recent studies have indicated that a lack of Oxalobacter formigenes colonization is a significant risk factor for calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. Our Preliminary data shows that healthy human subjects lacking O.formigenes can be readily colonized with live preparations of O.formigenes. This ability to colonize individuals offers a powerful means of assessing responses to varying diets before and after colonization. It is still not clear under what conditions O.formigenes modifies stone risk, and much still needs to be learned about how t h i s o r g a n i s m establishes and maintains gut colonization. In the previous funding cycle we identified in a mouse model conditions that influence the growth of O.formigenes in the gut, its degradation of oxalate in the gut, its effects on the amount of oxalate excreted in urine and into the intestine, and its sustainability in the absence of dietary oxalate. In this application we will extend these findings to humans by examining individuals before and after colonization with O.formigenes. Diets controlled in their contents of oxalate, calcium and other nutrients, including a diet ultra-low in oxalate, will be used to examine the interaction between diet, O.formigenes colonization and urinary oxalate excretion. This proposal will use spinach that contains carbon 13-oxalate to accurately determine whether colonization modifies the response to an oxalate-rich meal. Continuous intravenous infusions of the stable, non-radioactive oxalate isotope, 13C2- oxalate, before and after colonization will directly determine if gastrointestinal oxalate secretion occurs and whether colonization influences such secretion. Recent evidence suggests individuals are colonized with different strains and in some cases more than one strain. However, it is not known whether the biological differences between strains influence colonization persistence and urinary oxalate excretion and this will be examined in this application. If the specific aims are successfully completed they will provide valuable information about the importance of O.formigenes colonization in influencing oxalate levels, will create insight into the factors that impact O.formigenes colonization, and will help identify new strategies for modifying the gut milieu and calcium oxalate kidney stone risk."
"9546363","Summary  Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes major health problems with increasing incidence in endemic regions. Dengue fever, caused by any of the four DENV serotypes (DENV1-4), initially presents with non-specific symptoms of febrile illnesses, thus clinical diagnosis is often inaccurate. Early accurate diagnosis is important to monitor patients for severe complications due to internal hemorrhage and shock, which can be fatal without appropriate clinical management. Current DENV diagnostic methods either require specialized laboratory facilities, or have poor sensitivity in the acute phase. Antibody detection in the convalescent phase has poor specificity due to cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) provides high sensitivity and specificity, but current technologies are incompatible with peripheral low resource healthcare facilities that serve the majority of affected patients. The goal of this R21 project is to develop an initial prototype for a portable, inexpensive, robust, easy to use, integrated nucleic acid testing device consisting of a disposable cartridge and an inexpensive, compact, battery operated instrument that enables early, rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnosis of acute DENV infection. We have already developed such an integrated prototype device for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis from sputum. For diagnosis of DENV infection from whole blood, we have established proof of principle for processes required during sample preparation, amplification, and detection. Through the proposed project, we will further develop and optimize these processes, and then incorporate them into a cartridge and instrument prototype that leverages components of our existing NAAT device, but in a simpler format. Aim 1 entails optimization of processes for plasma separation, sample preparation, reverse transcription coupled to isothermal loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP), and visual lateral flow-based detection. In Aim 2 we will develop a prototype cartridge and instrument that integrates and automates these processes. Using the prototype device, we will demonstrate detection of all four DENV serotypes spiked into whole blood. Successful completion of this project entails demonstrating that the device can detect DENV1-4 in blood with limit of detection comparable to the FDA-cleared DENV1-4 real time RT-PCR assay developed by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC). In future efforts, once feasibility has been established, we will advance the initial prototype to a final version of the device, conduct full analytical validation and a field evaluation study, with the goal to obtain FDA clearance. Our long term goal is also to expand the multiplexing capabilities to enable differential diagnosis of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses."
"9654660","ABSTRACT  Despite stabilizing rates of prescription opioid pain reliever (OPR) overdoses, opioid-related mortality continues to rise because of increasing rates of heroin use and poisoning. Between 2013 and 2014, national estimates of nonmedical use of OPRs in the previous year declined from 11.08 to 10.34 million individuals. In contrast, heroin use increased from 0.68 to 0.91 million individuals. Mortality from heroin increased 26% in the last year and more than 300% over the last five years. The shift in trend is more than ecologic, as 40% to 70% of individuals who use heroin report nonmedical use of an OPR prior to initiating heroin. This is a substantial departure from historical trajectories of heroin use. For the great majority of individuals who began heroin use in the 1960s, heroin was their first opioid. While the risk of transition to heroin from nonmedical use of OPRs is low, contributing and pre-disposing factors are poorly understood. The burden of OPR and heroin-related adverse events is particularly high for individuals in Medicaid programs because they are more likely to have substance use disorders and are disproportionately represented among overdose deaths. The state of Oregon recently developed a state Performance Improvement Project (PIP) to reduce the proportion of high-dose opioid prescriptions in its Medicaid program, which is now delivered through 16 regionally and health system defined Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs). Because each CCO has flexibility to address the state's PIP, implementation across CCOs constitutes a natural experiment to study policy factors associated with change in OPR prescribing and heroin-related outcomes. In response to RFA-CE-16-003 (Research on Prescription Opioid Use, Opioid Prescribing, and Associated Heroin Risk; Priority #2), the objective of this study is to evaluate the relationships between OPR prescribing, CCO opioid dose reduction initiatives on patterns of OPR utilization, heroin use, and opioid-related overdoses. The objective is achieved through three Specific Aims using a mixed methods approach. First, using a multisource linked database that includes prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), Medicaid claims, vital statistics, and substance use treatment data from Oregon, relationships between OPR prescribing patterns and heroin-related outcomes will be tested. Second, using qualitative research methods, policies and procedures directed at improving the statewide high dose PIP by each CCO will be characterized. Finally, the effect of implementation of CCO PIP initiatives on high-risk OPR use and heroin-related outcomes will be evaluated. Findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of individual risk factors for transition to and overdose with heroin. Also, knowledge gained will assist local and national decision makers about policy levers to reduce the burden of OPR and heroin- related morbidity and mortality."
"9650399","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability among veterans, and Department of Veterans Affairs health care users are the most severely affected.  There is ample evidence that exercise improves pain, function, and other outcomes among patients with knee OA.  However, the vast majority of individuals with knee OA are physically inactive.  There is clearly a need to develop and implement programs that efficiently and effectively foster regular physical activity and improve key patient-centered outcomes among veterans with knee OA.  The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness a novel STepped Exercise Program for Knee OsteoArthritis (STEP-KOA).  This will be a randomized controlled trial of n=345 veterans with symptomatic knee OA in two VISN 6 sites, with participants assigned to two study arms: STEP-KOA and Arthritis Education Control (AE).  STEP- KOA will begin with three months of access to a low-resource internet-based exercise training program that uses patient-specific information to determine and deliver an appropriate personalized exercise plan (Step 1).  Participants who do not meet response criteria for clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function after three months of Step 1 will additionally receive telephone calls from an  exercise counselor for three months, to facilitate adherence and address barriers to physical activity (Step 2).  Participants who still fail to meet response criteria after Step 2 will receivein-person physical therapy visits, which address specific functional impairments and further tailor exercise recommendations (Step 3).  Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months (primary outcome time point).  Veterans in the AE group will be offered participation in STEP-KOA after completing study assessments.  The primary outcome will be the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a measure of lower extremity pain, stiffness and function.  The secondary outcomes will be objective measures of physical function.  The main study analyses will compare the STEP-KOA intervention to the AE control condition at follow-up time points.  We will also evaluate patient characteristics associated with the need for progression to each Step and will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of STEP-KOA.  This stepped exercise intervention is matched with patient needs, and it also provides the VA with a potential approach for focusing limited physical therapy resources toward patients who do not respond adequately to initial, less resource intensive and costly strategies to improve physical activity and related outcomes."

"9452658","Cyclophilin-D (Cyp-D) is a peptidyl prolyl isomerase which catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl prolyl bonds and thereby regulates conformational changes of target proteins. Cyp-D is the only cyclophilin res- ident in mitochondria, and until recently it was best known for its effect on the mitochondrial permeability transi- tion pore. We recently discovered that Cyp-D interacts with two of the three mitochondrial transcription factors (i.e., TFB1M and TFB2M but not TFAM) and subsequently found that Cyp-D also interacts with the mitochon- drial RNA polymerase. Genetic silencing of Cyp-D in isolated cells disrupted mitochondrial gene expression re- sulting in a reduction in mitochondrial O2 consumption (VO2). More recently, working with a constitutive Cyp-D knock out (Cyp-D KO) mice, we showed also in vivo reductions in VO2 (at rest and exercise). Concomitantly, the respiratory exchange ratio increased suggesting a metabolic shift favoring utilization of carbohydrates over fat. Intriguingly, the exercise capacity was increased pointing to an adaptive response whereby O2 utilization efficiency was increased. Using in silico modeling, we have identified small molecules able to destabilize the interaction between Cyp-D and TFB2M. Thus, we hypothesize that Cyp-D plays a key role in oxygen me- tabolism by regulating mitochondrial gene expression and signaling an adaptive increase in oxygen utilization efficiency. We propose to further this hypothesis based on two specific aims. Specific Aim 1: De- signed to complete the characterization of the Cyp-D effects on mitochondrial gene expression using cardiac relevant tissue and examine additional downstream processes ? also mediated by Cyp-D ? that may impact cell respiration (structured in 4 Sub Aims). Sub-Aim 1, designed to completely characterize the interactions among key players of the mitochondrial transcription machinery and assess their dependency on Cyp-D PPI- ase activity; Sub-Aim 2, designed to confirm that the effects of Cyp-D on mitochondrial gene expression are HSP2 specific (as suggested by preliminary data) and to assess whether Cyp-D silencing could signal up- stream and affect the expression of nuclear-encoded proteins of respiratory complexes; Sub-Aim 3, designed to confirm that Cyp-D silencing reduces mitochondrial encoded subunits of the respiratory chain complexes and F1FoATP synthase and examine whether Cyp-D overexpression results in the opposite effect; and Sub- Aim 4, to investigate whether Cyp-D also acts as chaperone aiding in the assembly of respiratory complexes. Studies under Specific Aim 1 will be conducted in adult mouse primary cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and tissues from Cyp-D KO and wild-type (WT) mice when relevant. Cyp-D will be modulated by using lentiviral vectors harboring constructs to silence or overexpress Cyp-D and pharmacological inhibition using cyclosporine A (CsA) and newly identified small molecules. Specific Aim 2: Designed to determine the functional conse- quences of genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of Cyp-D in mice and examine the underlying adap- tive mechanisms leading to increased O2 utilization efficiency. Cyp-D activity will be reduced by using constitu- tive and conditional Cyp-D KO mice and by pharmacological inhibition with cyclosporine A and small molecules able to selectively destabilize the interaction between Cyp-D and TFB2M. With constitutive Cyp-D KO mice, we will assess whether the findings in cell systems after acute Cyp-D ablation also occur in vivo and examine the adaptive responses leading to increased O2 utilization efficiency. With conditional Cyp-D KO mice, we will as- sess the immediate effects of Cyp-D ablation and whether an adaptive response occurs, subsequently examin- ing whether similar effects can be elicited through pharmacological inhibition. Myocardial energy effects along with functional myocardial effects will be assessed using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of increase O2 utilization efficiency may have important implications for human physiology and disease and plan to also examine effects in acute conditions of reduced O2 availability using models of cardiac arrest and hemorrhagic shock."
"9636323","Coronaviruses have the largest genomes among known RNA viruses and are phylogenetically divided into four genera. Some betacoronaviruses, such as HKU1, circulate annually in humans and cause mild yet prevalent respiratory disease whereas others, such as SARS-CoV and the recently emerged MERS-CoV, have caused pandemics with high case-fatality rates. Due to their pandemic potential and airborne transmissibility, highly pathogenic coronaviruses are now classified as NIAID Category C priority pathogens. Coronavirus cell tropism and host range are in large part determined by the viral surface spike (S) glycoprotein, which is the largest known class I viral fusion protein. After binding to host receptors and activation by host proteases, the S proteins undergo large conformational rearrangements that result in fusion of the viral and host-cell membranes. A molecular understanding of the structure, function and antigenicity of intact, trimeric S proteins would identify sites of vulnerability that could be targeted by vaccines, therapeutic antibodies and small- molecule antivirals. However, structural studies have been primarily limited to small S protein fragments, which has precluded a unifying structural framework for the biology of coronavirus S proteins.  To address this knowledge gap, we have generated soluble, trimeric S proteins from HKU1 and MERS- CoV that are amenable to structural analysis by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. We will determine atomic-level structures of these S proteins in both the prefusion and postfusion conformations, which will identify commonalities and differences among divergent betacoronaviruses and define the conformational end-states of the fusion process (Aim 1). With these constructs and a range of biochemical and biophysical assays, we will determine the molecular basis for receptor-induced conformational changes and investigate the effects of host proteases and acidification on this process (Aim 2). The combination of these studies will provide key molecular insights into S protein-mediated membrane fusion and answer long-standing questions regarding S protein triggering. Similar to other class I fusion proteins, such as influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and HIV-1 envelope (Env), coronavirus S proteins are the primary target for neutralizing antibodies and are thus a critical component of developmental vaccines. Currently, the best-characterized antibodies against coronaviruses target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and prevent binding to host cells. The RBD, however, is the most variable part of the spike protein and antibodies that target this domain are unlikely to be cross-reactive, similar to most HA head-binding antibodies. Therefore, we will define the epitopes and mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization for novel, non-RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies isolated by our collaborator Dr. Barney Graham (Aim 3). By identifying conserved sites of vulnerability, these studies will provide the foundation for the development of immunotherapies and vaccines that broadly protect against highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses, including those that have yet to emerge."
"9602393","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): When we choose between two options based on the rewards they promise, we make use of a highly specialized set of brain circuitry. Understanding this circuitry is important because it is the major target of abused drugs and because dysregulation of reward-based decisions is a major symptom of drug addiction. The goal of this project is to understand how that circuitry works. We focus on one brain area, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, that is consistently identified by neuroimaging studies as a critical site for rewards and decisions, but whose function remains mysterious. To probe its function, we will record responses of single neurons in this area while subjects perform two different tasks specifically designed to probe choice processes. First, we will examine the representation of risky options, and see whether vmPFC neurons represent their components - risk, stakes, probability, separately, or in a unified framework. Second, we will see whether neurons in this area signal positive and negative offers on a common scale. These first two projects will tell us how information about rewards is represented by vmPFC neurons. Then we will examine the responses of these neurons in a simple decision-making task in which subjects can accept or reject offers that bring costs and benefits. Finally, we will test whether vmPFC plays a causative role in choice by artificially altering neuronal activity there with a stimulating electrode. After completing these studies, we will have a first-ever basic understanding of the neuronal mechanics of reward-based choice processes."

"9414931","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Abstract Current application rates suggest that more than half of OEF/OIF Veterans will eventually apply for some form of service-connection, with approximately 100,000 Veterans per year being evaluated for psychiatric conditions. Veterans applying for service-connection for psychiatric conditions are in distress, and often are having occupational difficulties, but these are unaddressed during a typical Compensation and Pension evaluation. Counseling that addresses beneficiaries' concerns about losing compensation payments if working for pay, when supplemented by vocational supports, has been associated with increased employment among people disabled by chronic psychiatric conditions. Our group has developed an online Benefits Counseling intervention tailored to help Veterans applying for service-connection engage in work-related activities. We have demonstrated the efficacy of a face-to-face version of Benefits Counseling in a completed RR&D-funded six-month clinical trial in which Veterans assigned to Benefits Counseling worked significantly more days than controls,(p<.05, effect size = 0.69), reflecting an average of three more days of employment at six month follow-up. We then used a supplement from RR&D to develop a web-based version of this counseling, so that the counseling could be delivered without a counselor on-site. The web-based intervention was modified based on user feedback, but the extent to which it will be used by Veterans at home and how it will impact their behavior is unknown. In the proposed clinical trial, Veterans working two or fewer days per week who are presenting for a Compensation & Pension examination for a psychiatric disorder will be assessed at baseline and then urged to log in afterwards to a website for random assignment to either Remotely-Delivered Benefits Counseling (n=65) or Veterans Benefits Administration web sites (n=65), and will then be assessed at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after randomization in order to calculate standardized group mean differences between the slopes over time. The primary outcome measure will be the treatment-by-time slope of hours of paid work. Exploratory analyses will estimate associations of potential mediators of treatment response with this outcome. The proposed study will provide estimates of the efficacy of remotely-delivered Benefits Counseling initiated at Compensation and Pension examinations, a widely-used point of contact with VA."
"9627164","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metalloenzymes are important but challenging targets for computational studies because a reliable and computationally efficient potential function for the metal site is not straightforward to obtain. The challenges are particularly severe for metalloenzymes that feature structurally flexible active sites and/or dynamical metal coordination spheres, for which good examples include metalloenzymes with open active sites and thus promiscuous catalytic activities and proteins whose metal coordination sphere undergoes major redox/pH-coupled changes. Here we propose to develop novel QM/MM methods based on the latest formulation of density functional tight binding (DFTB3) approach to strike the proper balance of computational efficiency and accuracy for metalloenzymes. The specific aims are: 1. Parameterize DFTB3 for closed-shell systems (Mg, Zn, P and S) to facilitate the study of reactivity in flexible metalloenzymes that employ Mg and Zn as co-factors. Refine a novel DFTB3-MM interaction Hamiltonian and a multi-level QM/MM free energy framework that judiciously combines DFTB3/MM and high-level QM/MM potentials. The methods will be carefully benchmarked with both small molecule and metalloenzyme systems. 2. As an application to closed-shell metalloenzymes, dissect the catalytic mechanism of AP superfamily enzymes with both cognate and non-cognate substrates. Test the hypothesis that the remarkable catalytic promiscuity observed for the AP superfamily members is due to the significant structural flexibilities of the bi-metallic active site, which is able to recognize trasition states of distinct nature for different substrates. Test the computational results by comparing relevant observables (linear free energy relations, kinetic isotope effects, mutation and thio-effects) to experiments. 3. Introduce orbital angular momentum dependence of the Hubbard parameters into spin-polarized DFTB approach for the description of open-shell species. We will focus on the parameterization for copper and the method will be systematically tested and refined by comparing structural and energetic (e.g., reduction potential and pKa) properties of small molecules and copper proteins. Apply the approach to resolve several outstanding questions regarding the pH dependence of redox properties in blue copper proteins, setting the stage for applications to more complex problems, such as the binding of copper to proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases."
"9417045","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common polymorphisms at the CXCL12 locus significantly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). We have reproduced the association of this locus with CHD risk in multiethnic studies and have identified a novel variant that increases CHD risk, decreases plasma CXCL12 levels and alters expression of CXCL12 gene. We further hypothesized that if CXCL12 is causally involved in the pathogenesis of CHD than genetic variation at its primary receptor CXCR4 may also be associated with CHD. To test our hypothesis, we investigated genetic variation at the CXCR4 locus through meta-analyses of genetic data on common variants involving ~63,000 CHD cases and ~92,000 controls and fine-mapping experiments in ~50,000 CHD cases and ~50,000 controls. First, we were able to identify a common variant at the CXCR4 locus that is strongly associated with CHD risk (P = 4x10-7). Second, preliminary analyses of fine-mapping studies identified: (i) a low frequency variant in the promoter region of CXCR4 that associates with CHD risk at experiment-wide significance levels (OR: 1.13; P-value: 7.1x10-6) and (ii) a naturally occurring rare missense variant in the CXCR4 gene (I57L; OR: 2.16 P = 6x10-3) associated with increased CHD risk. The same analyses also identified a low-frequency missense variant in the CXCL12 gene (R125C; OR: 3.38; P = 0.01) nominally associated with increased CHD risk. Through mechanistic studies, we were able to further demonstrate that endothelial specific deficiency of CXCR4 leads to accelerated atherosclerosis in mice. Capitalizing on these findings, we plan to conduct genetic, biomarker, and mechanistic studies to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms and the directional impact of the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway on disease risk. Such evidence will help prioritize or deprioritize existing therapeutic programs that are already considering CXCL12 as a potential therapeutic target in CHD. In particular, we will reinforce our ongoing fine-mapping experiments by integrating (i) whole-exome sequencing studies in 10,000 early-onset MI cases (men and women aged ? 50 years) and 10,000 controls. We will further conduct (ii) measurements for circulating plasma CXCL12 levels in 12,000 participants (including 5,500 with incident CHD events and 3,000 participants in a high risk CHD group) enrolled in three prospective studies and three clinical trials. We will integrate evidence on plasma CXCL12 levels, genes and CHD risk to help assess directionality and utility of plasma CXCL12 as a marker of causality. We will mechanistically evaluate at the CXCL12 locus the lead coding and non- coding variants associated with CHD risk in human and murine cells and on mouse atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. We will also mechanistically evaluate CXCR4 genetic variation in human iPS cell derived macrophages and endothelial cells. We will obtain genotype specific human iPS cells through two complimentary approaches: (i) recall of participants based on genotype and (ii) targeted genome editing through TALENs. We will further conduct studies to investigate CXCR4 expression and protein function by genotype through specific quantitative and functional assays. Findings from the proposed study should have considerable translational implications. The two joint-PIs provide internationally recognized cross-disciplinary expertise in vascular biomarkers, epidemiology, experimental biology, and clinical medicine, a combination of skills that will help translate findings for clinical benefit."
"9417197","PROJECT SUMMARY- PROJECT 1 Cancer cells display uncontrolled inheritance of chromosomes, including errors in DNA replication and mitosis. These errors cause and propagate mutations and chromosomal abnormalities that further enhance cancer. Project 1 has been a leader in studying the mechanisms and control of inheritance of the human genome and has identified many of the key proteins that are involved in DNA synthesis at the replication fork and other proteins that are involved in the initiation of DNA replication. In the proposed studies, Project 1 will continue focusing on the mechanism and regulation of the initiation of DNA replication. Project 1 has discovered that certain initiation proteins are involved in many aspects of the cell division cycle, including centrosome duplication, centromere function and cytokinesis. Recent results also show that some initiation proteins are intimately involved in the fundamental decision of whether newly born cells will commit to a new round of cell division or enter into a period of quiescence. The proposed research will fall into three areas. Specific Aim 1 will focus on the role of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) subunit ORC1 and its related protein CDC6 in regulation of the commitment to cell division by controlling the expression of E2F1-regulated genes, in addition to the gene encoding Cyclin E, in cooperation with the tumor suppressor protein RB and the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1. Aim 1 will also focus on how CDC6 cooperates with ORC, RB, SUV39H1 and Cyclin dependent kinases to promote initiation of DNA replication. Specific Aim 2 will continue to study the role of the ORC subunits ORC2 and ORC3 at centromeres. ORC2 interacts with the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint protein BUBR1 only when it is phosphorylated during mitosis and defects in the BUBR1 binding domain of ORC2 cause the persistence of chromosomes that fail to align at the metaphase plate. Aim 2 will determine how ORC2 binds to BUBR1 and controls access of BUBR1. How ORC2 and ORC3 are recruited to centromeres, and the role of ORC3 interaction with the HP1 heterochromatin protein in chromosome segregation will also be studied. Project 3 will also study E2f1-regulated control of cell proliferation in a subset of breast and colon epithelial cancers have an acquired dependence of the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5. DDX5 is also required for progression of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This Aim will investigate how DDX5 becomes essential in some adult cancers and AML, while dispensable in normal epithelial and normal hematopoietic cells. Both RNA and protein binding partners will be identified, comparing both DDX5-dependent (DDX5-D) and DDX5-independent (DDX5-I) breast cancer cells. Exploiting the differential dependence on DDX5, Anti-Sense Oligonucleotides (ASO) will be developed for studying the role of DDX5 in mouse models for breast cancer and AML."
"9463193","Summary/Abstract An important cause of preterm labor is immune infiltration into the placenta. Although the placental immune response likely starts long before delivery, no technique currently available permits in vivo, real-time assessment of placental immune responses during pregnancy. As a result, clinicians have limited ability to detect placental inflammation or intervene so as to reduce the immune response and prevent preterm delivery. This R01 application proposes to develop a novel, noninvasive human placental immune imaging (PII) technique, which will be able to safely assess human placental inflammation in real time, responding to RFA-HD-18-003: Moving Beyond Standard Assessments: Applying Novel Tools to Assess Human Placental Structure and Function in Real Time. PII will be based on a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique called diffusion basis spectrum imaging, which can noninvasively image and quantify brain inflammation in multiple sclerosis in both animal models and human patients. Development of PII must take into account the fact that the human placenta is quite different from animal placentas and is a very dynamically changing organ throughout pregnancy. The anatomic and potential pathological complexity and heterogeneity of the placenta create strong background noise interference not present in the brain, making it more challenging to identify and extract the signals specific to placental inflammation. To address this technical challenge, this proposal will develop PII specifically for human applications by making use of three distinct clinical cohorts: those at low risk of preterm birth (Aim 1), and those at high risk of preterm birth who either respond or fail to respond to treatment to prevent preterm birth (Aims 2 and 3). In addition to performing PII on these women at two (Aims 2 and 3) or three (Aim 1) time points in pregnancy, this proposal includes measurement of immune factors and long non-coding RNAs in maternal blood, and histological characterization of inflammatory cells in placenta samples obtained at delivery. Completion of these aims will 1) yield a fully developed PII system, 2) refine PII through histopathological assessments of placentas and measures of systemic immune responses, 3) define the placental immune responses characteristic of healthy, term pregnancy, 4) identify placental immune responses characteristic of pregnancies at risk of preterm birth, and 5) begin to reveal immune signatures associated with success and failure of progesterone treatment. Because PII will require MRI sequences that are already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, its safety and great accessibility will allow it to be rapidly extended to clinical trials or clinical populations."
"9450785","Nearly 1 in 20 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime, and over 1/3 of these will die from the disease. In fact, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in this country. Advances in prevention and treatment have made only a modest impact on incidence and survival. Novel treatment strategies for colorectal cancer are clearly needed. Chemokines have emerged as a crucial link between tumor-promoting inflammation and cancer. CCR6 is the only known receptor for the inflammatory chemokine CCL20, which in turn is the only known ligand for CCR6. Several lines of evidence suggest that interactions between the inflammatory chemokine CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 play a key role in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. Correlative evidence has suggested a possible role of CCR6 and CCL20 in promoting colorectal tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. To date, however, beyond our preliminary results, there is a paucity of in vivo data on the effect of disrupting CCL20-CCR6 interactions in colorectal cancer in the setting of an intact immune system. We have demonstrated that both CCL20 and CCR6 are upregulated in human colon cancers. We have found that deficiency of CCR6 is associated with a dramatic decrease in adenoma formation in a model of spontaneous intestinal carcinogenesis and a marked decrease in tumor growth in a syngeneic transplantable tumor model. We have observed that CCL20 signaling through CCR6 induces further secretion of CCL20, and this in turn promotes proliferation and migration in colorectal cancer cells. In addition to the epithelial cell effects of CCL20-CCR6 interactions, a stromal effect is evidenced by the fact that in the tumor challenge experiments, the transplanted colon cancer cells expressed CCR6 in both arms, yet growth was delayed in CCR6-deficient host mice. We have found that CCR6 deficiency is associated with decreased macrophage migration into adenomas and transplanted colon cancers. We have further demonstrated that CCL20-CCR6 interactions indeed induce monocyte/macrophage migration in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we have observed that growth of transplanted colon cancer tumors is delayed by depletion of tumor macrophages. Lastly, we have found that tumor macrophages secrete inflammatory mediators, which in turn induce proliferation of colon cancer cells. In aggregate our preliminary results imply that CCL20-CCR6 signaling promotes colorectal cancer through a direct effect on neoplastic cancer cells as well as through effects on tumor stromal cells such as macrophages. We have recently begun to test a novel, orally-available small molecule CCR6 inhibitor. Our preliminary data show that this molecule can inhibit the CCL20 auto feedback loop, colorectal cancer cell proliferation, and monocyte migration in vitro. Thus we hypothesize that targeting interactions between CCL20 and CCR6 is effective for the treatment of colorectal cancer. To test this hypothesis and to further elucidate the role of CCR6 and CCL20 in colorectal cancer, we aim to: 1) establish the impact of targeting CCL20-CCR6 interactions on the neoplastic epithelial cells in colorectal cancer; 2) establish the outcome of targeting CCL20-CCR6 interactions on tumor-promoting stroma in colorectal cancer; and 3) establish the efficacy of targeting CCL20-CCR6 interactions in translationally relevant models of human colorectal cancer. The proposed studies will shed light on the role of the chemokine receptor CCR6 and its ligand CCL20 in colorectal cancer. We believe that these studies will determine the clinical relevance and therapeutic importance of interactions between CCR6 and CCL20 in this disease and should pave the way to successful targeting of this pathway in human patients."
"9491897","SUMMARY Although APOL1 risk alleles are among the most powerful common genetic disease variants identified to date in terms of frequency and effect size, the presence of two risk alleles (a high-risk genotype) does not lead to kidney disease in all or even most individuals. We have been seeking factors that lead from APOL1 risk genotype to overt kidney disease. We have identified candidate genetic factors that modify the risk of disease. We have begun to dissect the upstream and downstream biochemical modifiers of APOL1-associated disease and believe that we have made significant progress towards these goals. Our genetic and biochemical studies have shown that pro-inflammatory stimuli such as interferons can regulate APOL1 expression leading to overt disease in individuals with a high-risk APOL1 genotype, and that disease is reversible when the stimuli are removed. We have begun investigating post-transcriptional modifications of APOL1 mRNA and the effect of microRNA on APOL1 levels. In this application, we outline studies to continue pursuing what we believe to be the most fruitful of these directions. We aim to do the following: Aim 1. Define the genetics and biology of loci modifying the APOL1-associated FSGS phenotype. We will replicate the admixture associations in individuals with FSGS that we have identified on Chr18q22-23 and Chr6p21-22 loci and determine if there is evidence of admixture association at other genomic regions as well. We will perform fine-mapping to identify the variants driving the admixture signal. We will perform functional tests of genes and their haplotype-defining variants. Aim 2: Define how inflammatory factors and pathways upregulate APOL1 expression in vitro and in vivo. We will elucidate how TLR4 activation (by LPS and lipids) drives APOL1 expression as we did previously for TLR3 activation (by double-stranded RNA). We will validate these pathways for APOL1 induction in vivo and observe how various inflammatory stimuli drive APOL1 expression in different kidney cell types. We will then ask how induction of wild-type and risk-variant APOL1 via these stimuli impacts kidneys in vivo and whether we can reverse APOL1 toxicity by blocking inflammation-driven APOL1 expression. Aim 3. Determine how the APOL1 3'UTR and microRNA regulate APOL1 function. We will identify the tissues and cells where APOL1 3'-UTR cleavage occurs. We will determine how APOL1 mRNA cleavage alters mRNA half-life and regulation by miRNA. We will explore how 3'-UTR cleavage alters APOL1 translation and trafficking. Lastly, we will pair a genome-wide miRNA screen with profiling of human glomerular miRNA expression to identify miRNA that regulate APOL1 in health and disease.  "
