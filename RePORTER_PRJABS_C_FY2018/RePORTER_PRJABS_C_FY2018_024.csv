"9540170","Project Summary: Neural mechanisms of live joint attention in autism spectrum disorders: an fNIRS hyperscanning investigation Autism spectrum disorder is a prevalent disorder affecting 1 in 68 children worldwide, with significant mental and emotional toll on patients and their families. The biological basis of these disorders is still unknown, but deficits in initiating and responding to joint attention are one of the earliest signs and predict later difficulties with language and social cognition. Thus far, joint attention has largely been studied using neuroimaging of solo individuals as they engage in these tasks. However, recent studies support the hypothesis that specialized neural mechanisms are recruited during live interactions between people that cannot be detected with traditional single subject experiments. These specialized mechanisms may play a role in disorders of social communication such as autism. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be used to detect the brain activity from two individuals as they engage in a social interaction. This proposal aims to design and implement a novel joint attention paradigm using fNIRS in which two people are facing each other and engaging in the task, enabling an analysis of what neural mechanisms are unique to a live social interaction compared to interactions with videos or non-social cues, and how these mechanisms are altered in the brains of people with autism. The first aim is to develop a novel, two-person paradigm to study joint attention during live interaction between two people. This will necessitate the design of a two-person experiment with a live interaction condition as well as conditions using non-responsive face videos and an arrow as a non-social cue to direct the attention. The second aim is to examine the differences in the neural circuitry of individuals with autism as they engage in live social interactive joint attention tasks with a neurotypical partner. Brain activity detected using fNIRS will be determined for a live partner cue versus non-responsive and non-social cues. Areas that show greater brain activity during the live social interaction in typical adults will be analyzed in adults with autism to asses whether neural responses to live interaction are fundamentally altered in people with this disorder. The third aim is to analyze the coherence in response to rapid interaction cues between the brains of two individuals during live joint attention. Wavelet analysis will be used to determine what brain areas show increased coherence across paired individuals during the live interaction compared to the other conditions. Areas that show increased coherence in pairs of typical individuals will provide a hypothesis for testing coherence between pairs when one individual has autism. Evidence for neural mechanisms specific to live joint attention that are altered in autism will provide important advances in understanding the fundamental basis of this disorder."
"9445461","Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the US. Medical imaging is integral to the diagnosis and management of CAD fueling the development of new technologies and applications. However, imaging of the heart continues to be a challenging task. There is always a degree of temporal blur or motion artifact, the impact and documented limitations of which remain uncertain. Additionally, patient body habitus and technical limitations may contribute to high noise and degrade spatial resolution. For imaging modalities involving ionizing radiation like CT, radiation dose is also an ever-present reality that needs to be minimized without compromising image quality. Clinical trials are the best avenue for the evaluation of imaging technologies, but the ever-expanding number of technologies and parameters make a trial for every application or protocol unfeasible, pragmatically and financially. As a result, medical imaging researchers, industry, and the FDA are increasingly moving toward computerized simulations or `virtual trials'. Virtual trials involve the use of computational tools to perform experiments entirely on the computer. Realistic patient models or phantoms are combined with validated imaging simulations to emulate imaging examinations and patient conditions. These can subsequently be used to ascertain how differing patient attributes and imaging conditions impact dose, image quality, and depiction of pre-defined known conditions. The findings can be used to prescribe specific imaging protocols and optimal scan parameters that are customized to individual patient anatomy to provide a sufficient degree of certainty for effective clinical decision-making. The goal of this project is to develop, validate, and distribute to the research community a computational platform (including a series of anatomically variable phantoms with realistic finite-element cardiac models, accurate models for modern imaging devices, and a suite of image quality metrics) to perform virtual trials in dynamic cardiac imaging. The virtual framework can be extended to any number of cardiac conditions, imaging modalities, and technologies. As a first case study in our long-term strategy, the focus of this project is on CT as it has both a great need for and great potential to provide high spatial and temporal resolution for the optimized evaluation of CAD. If CT image quality is not optimal, the evaluation of CAD, particularly the degree of stenosis and characterization of high-risk plaque features, may be compromised. The tools we develop will provide the first practical platform to characterize the precise impact of the technical aspects of CT on image quality over a wide range of patient anatomies with the view to enable optimal visualization of cardiac conditions at the lowest possible radiation dose for a given patient. The approach has great potential to significantly improve clinical investigations of heart disease, extending beyond CT imaging and CAD, paving the way towards faster translation of new cardiac imaging technologies into the clinic and more precise and personalized patient management."
"9477965","High rates of chronic upper and lower airways disease have occurred in Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) workers exposed to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster site between 9/11/2001 and 9/24/2001. The effect of WTC exposure on lung function was greater in some individuals than others. We initiated a biomarker discovery program using 8,000 serum collected within 6 months of WTC exposure to identify who was at greatest risk for adverse outcomes. To enhance our biomarker discovery program, 2,132 WTC-exposed rescue and recovery workers had serum collected between 12/2013 and 10/2015. We have identified multiple cytokines that predict future abnormal FEV1 using serum that was drawn and stored between 10/2001 and 3/2002. Since a majority of firefighters with respiratory symptoms and reactive airway disease have normal FEV1, we explored the rate of decline in FEV1 as another definition of a poor outcome. In a longitudinal study of WTC-exposed firefighters, we recently observed that about 20% had > 64 ml/year decline in FEV1, which was more than twice the average age-related decline of 32 ml/year (henceforth enhanced- FEV1-decline). Examination of the complete blood count (CBC) data stored in the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program data warehouse has revealed that higher eosinophil (Eos) and polymorphoneutrophil (PMN) concentrations are risk factors for enhanced-FEV1-decline post-9/11. Examination of available serum biomarker data from two distinct subsets of this population revealed that IgE is also a risk factor for enhanced- FEV1-decline. This proposal will confirm and extend these preliminary observations with biomarker studies on larger, more representative subsets of WTC-exposed rescue and recovery workers. We propose to use the recently obtained serum to test if biomarkers such as IgE are persistently elevated in the enhanced-FEV1- decline group. Specific AIM 1 will test the hypothesis that Eos, PMN, IgE and inflammatory cytokines measured in the 6 months post-9/11 are risk factors for enhanced-FEV1-decline using a case-control design with frequency matching. Specific AIM 2 will test the hypothesis that the IgE and cytokines measured in the 6 months post-9/11 will be associated incident airway reactivity. Specific AIM 3 will test the hypothesis that persons with high levels IgE and cytokines measured in the 6 months post-9/11 will continue to show high levels in 2013-2015. If elevated biomarker levels persist, then the information derived from this research might be applied to those without stored serum. The primary goal of this investigation is to validate biomarkers of progressive decline in lung function and airway reactivity. The ultimate goal of this line of investigation is to develop risk stratification models to identify subpopulations at high risk of adverse pulmonary outcomes after intense irritant exposure. This will allow for more intensive monitoring and early treatment of high risk individuals, instead of devoting costly resources toward intensive screening of low risk individuals."

"9621635","Project Summary / Abstract  Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common form of heart failure, a condition that accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million. DCM specifically has a prevalence of 250,00- 400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of DCM is the intracoronary injection of cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), which has been demonstrated to reduce fibrotic infiltrate and exhibit various other cardioprotective properties. However, the underlying mechanisms of how reducing the fibrotic load exactly leads to improved structural remodeling remains unclear. Furthermore, current non- invasive technologies characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of CDC in DCM patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of CDC application to DCM patients by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with diffusion tensor cardiac MRI (DT-CMR). DT-CMR is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current DT-CMR methods to be applied robustly in a clinical setting. In this project, an innovative DT-CMR method will be developed that overcomes such limitations. The central hypothesis is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of DT-CMR to serve as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of CDCs on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted CMR. The proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-CMR methodology and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of CDC therapy on the microstructural remodeling of DCM thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization or improvement of CDC therapy."
"9418951","Project Summary The Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) at the University of Massachusetts Boston (UMB) is a multifaceted program that seeks to increase diversity in the biomedical research workforce at the PhD level. The program has two overall goals. The first is to provide a comprehensive research training program to undergraduate students from underrepresented minority or disadvantaged backgrounds so they are exceptionally prepared and highly motivated to enter PhD programs in the biomedical sciences. The second, broader goal is to catalyze institutional changes that enhance the overall research training environment in the sciences for undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented or disadvantaged backgrounds. The IMSD program provides its participants with research experiences, intensive mentoring, a comprehensive and structured suite of enrichment activities, and support in the application process for PhD programs, all to promote their successful entry into these programs. The centerpiece of the IMSD student experience is laboratory research?each participant carries out a closely guided research project, which supports the development of research independence, in the laboratory of a research advisor. Mentoring includes academic advising as well as support for the students' overall professional and personal development as emerging researchers. Enrichment opportunities, which also engage the broader community of science majors at the University, include extensive training in scientific communication, opportunities to network with scientists and graduate students outside UMB, exposure to research career opportunities, training in the responsible conduct of research, and discussions about social aspects of science. To catalyze institutional change, IMSD offers activities that are aimed at reaching the maximum number of undergraduate students, as well as mentor training opportunities for science faculty and graduate students. IMSD also interfaces with a wide network of training programs at the University and is taking a leadership role in developing, evaluating, and modeling effective research training strategies that can be applied broadly in the University. It also nurtures collaborations with institutional partners outside UMB. In efforts to sustain enhancements to the research training environment and capacity, IMSD has successfully institutionalized many of its programmatic components and is committed to institutionalizing additional aspects that prove to be effective in helping UMB students achieve academic excellence in the sciences and transition to graduate study. These efforts can have broad impact given the highly diverse student population at UMB and the very significant proportion of its students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds."
"9454965","PROJECT SUMMARY  Tracking population-based HIV transmission dynamics is critical to design and monitor effective interventions. Despite widespread prevention, HIV incidence has failed to decline among some subgroups in the United States (US) including young men who have sex with men (MSM). Such disparities are notable in the Southern US which is at the epicenter of the national epidemic with the greatest burden in new and prevalent infections. Significant disparities in HIV infection exist based on race/ethnicity and risk behaviors, but also in geography; a higher proportion of cases are reported outside large urban areas compared to other regions.  Delineating HIV transmission dynamics in the Southern US can identify ongoing transmission networks or clusters where targeted prevention measures may be more impactful at reducing local incidence. However, the success of such measures requires timely identification and response to emerging or expanding clusters. Prospective phylogenetic analyses of HIV sequences integrated with epidemiologic and clinical surveillance data would facilitate the timely detection and monitoring of transmission networks. When combined with phylodynamic modeling, cluster expansion and transmission dynamics could be better predicted and the impact of interventions assessed.  Our overall hypotheses are: 1) Prospective phylogenetic cluster analysis allows timely identification of transmission chains not apparent through routine surveillance, 2) Persons identified in expanding clusters represent the leading edge of local transmission, i.e. recent infection, 3) Targeting prevention towards growing clusters will identify a higher proportion of recent infections and ultimately reduce incidence. These hypotheses will be addressed in North Carolina (NC) with three specific aims: Aim 1: To describe the demographic and geographical characteristics of HIV transmission involving persons with newly reported HIV infection using phylogenetic clustering, viral load, and risk behaviors; Aim 2: To assess HIV cluster expansion and inform phylodynamic models by integrating large-scale deep sequencing and contact networks involving cases with newly diagnosed HIV infection; Aim 3: To conduct a preliminary assessment of a cluster-directed partner services intervention to interrupt HIV transmission networks.  These aims will be addressed through a combination of strategies in collaboration with the NC Department of Health and Human Services. A statewide prospective, automated cluster analysis system (nextHIV) will be evaluated. Sequences from reference laboratories and deep sequencing of diagnostic specimens from public testing sites will be analyzed in near-real time. Clusters will be characterized with detailed epidemiological data including HIV viral loads and contact networks. A proof-of-concept, cluster-directed partner services intervention will be assessed in an 11 county region with high HIV burden. Phylodynamic and mathematical modeling will be used to assess cluster expansion and the potential impact of interventions."
"9438409","Serpin family protein protease inhibitors function as key anticoagulant regulators of blood coagulation proteases. Two serpins, antithrombin and protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI), are known to inhibit procoagulant proteases in a manner that is regulated by cofactors and dependent on the functional state of the proteases, but the molecular details of this complex regulatory mechanism are poorly understood. The physiologic importance of these serpins in regulating coagulation proteases is borne out by the observations that knocking out the mouse genes results in embryonic lethality due to a consumptive coagulopathy in the case of antithrombin and a prothrombotic phenotype when mice are bred on a factor V Leiden background in the case of ZPI. Our proposed studies seek to build on our prior studies to advance molecular understanding of the cofactor-dependent regulation of blood coagulation proteases by these serpins. With respect to antithrombin, our recent studies have suggested an important revision of the allosteric mechanism of activation of this serpin by heparin in showing that activation is mediated principally by the mitigation of repulsive interactions with factor Xa and factor IXa within an antithrombin exosite rather than by provision of an attractive exosite. Our proposed continuation studies seek to characterize the molecular determinants in antithrombin of protease binding exosites and of the allosteric communication network involved in transmitting activating conformational changes from the heparin binding site to the protease binding site. With respect to ZPI, our studies seek to elucidate the physiologic complexes of factor Xa that are targeted by ZPI and its cofactor, protein Z, establish the role of the unique N-terminal tail of ZPI in anticoagulant regulation of factor Xa and discover small molecules that disrupt the ZPI-protein Z complex and downregulate the ZPI anticoagulant mechanism as a potential novel therapy for restoring hemostasis in hemophilia bleeding disorders. Gain of function studies in which the serpin scaffold of ?1-protease inhibitor is used to graft the molecular determinants of the protein Z binding site and protease binding sites onto ZPI will provide a stringent test of the minimal determinants of cofactor and protease recognition by this serpin."
"9450537","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The general goals of this project are to illuminate the nature and functions of memory, and to examine how memory is used to create mental simulations of possible future and past experiences. Recent evidence indicates that the same brain network is involved in both remembering past personal experiences (episodic memory), and imagining or simulating hypothetical experiences that might occur in the future or might have occurred in the past (episodic simulation). The proposed experiments take a cognitive neuroscience approach that links together cognitive and neural processes to understand episodic memory and episodic simulation.  One set of experiments will explore how episodic memories are modified or restructured as a consequence of retrieving them from alternative perspectives: either a field perspective (through one's own eyes) or an observer perspective (an external vantage point). These experiments will also examine the hypothesis that restructuring of episodic memories and constructions of episodic simulations rely on common underlying processes, applying a technique that analyzes repetition-related reductions in brain activity. A second set of experiments will use an episodic specificity induction: brief training in recollecting specific details of recent experiences that selectively increases the number of episodic details (e.g., what happened, where it happened) that participants provide on later tasks which require recalling episodic memories of actual past events or constructing episodic simulations of possible future events, while having no effect on retrieval of semantic details (e.g., related facts or reflections) and no effect on a task that requires describing a picture. Ths the specificity induction represents a promising means of selectively targeting episodic retrieval processes. Proposed experiments will test hypotheses concerning a specific brain subsystem that may be affected by the induction and whether the induction affects primarily the initial construction or subsequent elaboration of remembered or simulated events. The final set of studies will test hypotheses concerning a region that has been consistently linked with episodic memory and simulation, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, but whose role in these processes remains poorly understood. These experiments will explore the idea that this region facilitates access to prior affective knowledge so that individuals can simulate what it might feel like to experience a future episode. For example, one study will test the hypothesis that greater activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex is observed with greater familiarity of the people and places that comprise episodic simulations, and that this activity also increases with greater anticipated pleasantness of the simulated episode. Another study will explore how this region contributes to the affective quality of a simulated episode.  Overall, these experiments should both enhance understanding of basic processes involved in episodic memory and episodic simulation, and could also provide insights relevant to clinical conditions in which episodic memory and simulation are impaired."
"9447098","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enteric pathogens cause disease among individuals living in both developing and industrialized countries, with some pathogens being universal, while others are largely restricted to certain settings. Certain enteric pathogens are epidemiologically emerging or re-emerging. Travelers from industrialized countries who visit developing countries form a special risk group that bridges the two broad ecologies. Finally, a few enteric pathogens are of special interest from the civilian biodefense perspective, as they have been used by nefarious individuals to promulgate bioterror (non-typhoidal Salmonella), or have properties that suit them to such a purpose (Shigella dysenteriae 1). The five Projects described in this Enteric Center for Excellence in Translation Research (Enteric CETR) proposal, bonded by the theme Immunoprophylactic Strategy to Control Emerging Enteric Infections, will undertake translational research towards developing products to prevent enteric disease caused by several important bacterial and protozoal pathogens, including: the enteric fever Salmonella serovars S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi A and S. Paratyphi B (Project 1); Clostridium difficile (Project 2); Shigella, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) diarrheal pathogens (Project 3); non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars that cause invasive disease and/or gastroenteritis (emphasizing group C serovars) (Project 4); the protozoan species Cryptosporidium hominis and C. parvum (Project 5). Whereas each pathogen represents an important public health priority, only one, S. Typhi, already has licensed vaccines to prevent disease and those are not ideal. Three projects intend to progress new vaccine candidates to the point where Investigational New Drug Applications (IND) could be prepared to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials. These include: i) a Shigella live vector vaccine expressing protective antigens to prevent clinical  illness caused by several pathotypes of diarrhea-causing Escherichia coli (Project 3); ii) Core-O polysaccharide-flagellin conjugate parenteral vaccines, as well as engineered recombinant attenuated strains, to prevent invasive disease caused by non-typhoidal serovars of Salmonella Group C1 & C2 (Project 4); iii) a vaccine based on proteins from C. hominis and C. parvum sporozoites; iv) a bivalent adjuvanted cTxAB toxoid vaccine to prevent recurrent C. difficile disease (Project 2). We will also investigate a unique passive antibody approach to prevent C. difficile disease (Project 2). Finally, Project 1 aims to explain the cross protection observed in large-scale field trials wherein oral immunization with live S. Typhi vaccine strain Ty21a conferred cross protection against S. Paratyphi B, whereas no protection was afforded against S. Paratyphi A. Most projects will utilize innovative animal models including senescent mouse models (to explore how aging influences immune response to vaccines) and the gnotobiotic piglet model. All projects include collaborations of investigators across multiple institutions of he consortium. The Enteric CETR PL/PD is highly experienced in translational research and vaccine product development."
"9464363","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Orofacial sensorimotor cortex (OSMcx)-orofacial primary motor cortex (MIo), primary somatosensory cortex (SIo), cortical masticatory area (CMAp)-dysfunction has been implicated in many orofacial sensorimotor disorders, including dysphagia, orofacial dystonia and dysarthria, spasmodic dysphonia, apraxia of speech, bruxism, chronic pain, and temporomandibular disorders. OSMcx displays neuroplasticity in association with acquisition of novel oral motor skills, intra-oral manipulations, and pain, and clinically targeting OSMcx has promise in treatment of orofacial disorders, such as dysphagia. The relationship between OSMcx neuroplasticity and learning of new oral skills is poorly understood, and the potential of OSMcx-targeted therapies for rehabilitation of speech, chewing, and swallowing disorders is barely explored. What roles do MIo, SIo, & CMAp independently and collectively play in control of natural feeding and trained orofacial motor tasks? How are neuroplastic changes in OSMcx orofacial motor and sensory representations related to changes in task performance?  To address these questions, we will quantify neuroplasticity in OSMcx, and encoding of tongue and jaw kinematics and kinetics by recording simultaneously from MIo, SIo, & CMAp during natural feeding and learning of tongue protrusion or incisor biting tasks. We have 3 specific aims: Aim 1: to document the modulation of activity in neural ensembles in MIo, SIo, & CMAp during feeding, and performance of tongue protrusion or incisor-biting tasks before, during, and after long-term training to these tasks. Aim 2: to document simultaneously in MIo, SIo, & CMAp the encoding of jaw and tongue kinematics and kinetics in neural ensembles during feeding and during performance of tongue protrusion or incisor-biting tasks before, during, and after long-term training to these tasks. Aim 3: to document simultaneously in MIo, SIo, & CMAp the timing and nature of neuroplasticity associated with training in tongue protrusion or incisor biting tasks. The proposed research will provide novel insights into neuronal processes underlying OSMcx control of orofacial function and lay the groundwork for future studies of the rehabilitative potential of intensive task training and neuroplastic changes n OSMcx in recovery of orofacial function. These data will inform treatments of sensorimotor disorders that target OSMcx, such as those using stimulation or brain machine interfaces. The proposed research will leverage significant advances in neural recording, kinematic measurement, and data analysis that are being applied to studies of reach-to-grasp behaviors and, for the first time, apply them to addressing clinically significant problems in orofacial function."
"9486006","Project Summary The striatum is critical for learning and performance of goal-directed behaviors. This critical function is impaired in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. The goal of the proposed studies is to establish a causal link between computations in striatal microcircuits and the learning and performance of goal directed behaviors. It is hypothesized that the feedforward inhibitory microcircuit in the striatum explicitly represents the proximity between self and goal, and uses this representation to command direction-specific velocity controllers downstream to generate the appropriate behavior. We will use an integrative approach combining wireless in vivo recording in awake behaving mice and 3D motion capture during continuous goal pursuit in freely moving mice. Aim 1 will determine cell-type specific striatal representations underlying goal pursuit, using objective quantification of movement parameters in freely moving mice and in vivo recording of single unit activity. Aim 2 will determine the causal contributions of specific circuit components during goal pursuit, using optogenetics to manipulate neural activity in defined neuronal populations bidirectionally. Finally, Aim 3 will quantify corticostriatal plasticity ex vivo following acquisition of goal-directed behavior, to determine the relationship between corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission and learning. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings will be done on brain slices from animals at different stages of training. Results from proposed studies will shed light on the computational functions of striatal microcircuits in acquiring and generating goal directed behaviors."
"9460914","PROJECT SUMMARY Patients treated with dialysis report very low levels of physical activity, and physical activity correlates with functional status, which is also impaired in the dialysis population. In the general population, higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower cardiovascular risk and better endothelial function. There are recommended levels of physical activity for the general population that are known to improve both cardiovascular risk and endothelial function. Although there are international guidelines for physical activity in patients treated with dialysis, the activity targets (which are derived from evidence in non-dialysis populations) are not being met. Prior exercise studies in the dialysis population have focused on aerobic training or resistance training and have shown improvement in physical functioning, but very few studies have actually targeted increasing physical activity. The moderate to vigorous interventions studied may limit participation for many dialysis patients. The major goal of this study is to determine whether a pedometer-based intervention can increase physical activity among patients on dialysis and whether increasing activity can improve physical and endothelial function, and symptom severity. We propose a 3-month randomized controlled trial comparing pedometers and weekly activity goals to usual care among 60 patients on dialysis, with a 6 month-follow up for maintenance. Our research approach and study design allow for measurement of change over time not only in the intervention group but in the standard of care group, in an area for which little longitudinal data exists. Our study could establish an important and actionable link between exercise, endothelial function, and cardiovascular health in this complicated population.  "
"9598755","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Müller glial cells (MGs) are the primary support cells in the vertebrate retina. In cold-blooded vertebrates such as zebrafish, MGs are a source of stem cells for they can readily re-enter the cell cycle and replenish lost neurons, establishing a powerful self-repair mechanism. In mammals, however, MGs are naturally quiescent and lack regenerative capability. Photoreceptors are the most abundant cells in the mammalian retina and they mediate the first step in vision. The death of photoreceptors is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness in major retinal degenerative diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Extensive research efforts aimed at restoring the regenerative capability of MGs in mammals have met with little success. Current strategies for MG-derived photoreceptor regeneration rely on retinal injury and treatment of the whole retina with various factors. Retinal injury kills retinal neurons in the first place. Global treatment of the entire retina may lead to undesirable side effects in untargeted cells. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the molecular and cellular pathways underlying MG-derived photoreceptor regeneration, and to develop strategies to activate the regenerative capability of mammalian MGs for retinal self-repair. We propose to reprogram adult mouse MGs, in vivo, for regeneration of rod photoreceptors without retinal injury, through the following Aims: Aim 1) Investigate whether Wnt signaling is an injury-induced signaling pathway to activate MG proliferation. We will examine whether neurotoxic injury activates Wnt signaling and further test whether inhibition of Wnt signaling suppressed injury-induced MG proliferation. To target MGs cell-type-specifically, we will develop a gene transfer method targeting MGs cell-type-specifically. Aim 2) Restore the retinal progenitor/stem cell status of MGs through activation of Wnt signaling, without introduction of retinal injury. We will investigate whether gene transfer of ?-catenin activates Wnt signaling and MG proliferation without retinal injury. GSk3? regulates Wnt signaling by phosphorylation of ?-catenin leading to its degradation. We will examine whether deletion of GSK3? activates Wnt signaling and MG proliferation without retinal injury. Aim 3) Guide the differentiation of MG-derived retinal progenitor/stem cells to rod photoreceptors. We will guide the differentiation of MG-derived retinal progenitor/stem cells by gene transfer of transcription factors that are essential for rod photoreceptor cell fate determination and differentiation during retinal development, and test whether MG-derived new rods develop molecular, structural, and functional properties of native rods. Our proposed research will significantly advance our understanding of the basic mechanisms and functional implications of MG-derived rod photoreceptor regeneration in adult mammalian retina, and will set the stage for retinal self-repair in a major group of retinal degenerative diseases typically characterized by photoreceptor degeneration."
"9529873","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lyme disease (LD) results from infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi transmitted via the bite of a tick. It is the most common arthropod-borne disease in the United States. B. burgdorferi is maintained in a natural enzootic cycle, alternating between a vertebrate host reservoir, usually a small mammal, and an Ixodes tick. How B. burgdorferi senses and adapts to these disparate environments to complete its enzootic cycle, and thus persist to remain a public health problem, is not well understood. In this application, we propose to investigate a novel signaling pathway that regulates the interaction of B. burgdorferi with its tick vector. Our central hypothesis is that carbonyl stress, mediated by the overlooked metabolite methylglyoxal (MG), has an important role in persistence of the spirochete in the tick. MG is produced in bacteria by methylglyoxal synthase (MgsA), which converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate to MG and inorganic phosphate. Our preliminary data indicate that this activity is likely to occur in the tick, is dependent on MgsA and post-translationally glycates specific target proteins. In Aim 1, we propose to genetically and biochemically define the carbonyl stress pathway and the regulation of MG production in B. burgdorferi. We will also examine the role of the carbonyl stress pathway in the tick-mouse model of LD and identify the proteins targeted for glycation by MG. In our second aim, we propose to genetically dissect MgsA function in LD Borrelia by comparative analyses with RF Borrelia and B. mayonii to better understand the role of carbonyl stress in vivo. The long-term objective of our proposal is to understand the unique strategies and mechanisms B. burgdorferi uses to persist in the tick and transmit to mammals, which may lead to improved diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies; this is relevant to the mission of the agency to ?seek fundamental knowledge? for the sake of alleviating human disease."
"9233023","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this SBIR Phase II project, the mechanical and fatigue-related properties of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) joint implant materials will be improved by creating a composite material with carbon reinforcements. UHMWPE has long been widely used as wear surfaces in joint implants, and further improvements to its wear resistance have been obtained by cross-linking the polyethylene chains. However, the cross-linking process also degrades some mechanical properties, including toughness, fatigue and yield strengths. Incorporating carbon reinforcements into UHMWPE through the manner described will improve the strength, crack propagation resistance and creep resistance of UHMWPE without compromising its low wear rate. The carbon reinforcements will impart unmatched dimensional stability and toughness to the UHMWPE matrix. Moreover, as the wear surface remains (primarily) UHMWPE, the outstanding wear resistance of UHMWPE will be maintained, if not improved through the mechanical enhancements. Several of these hypotheses were validated during Phase I by preparing composite materials under various formation conditions, and then assessing their mechanical and tribological properties. Should the new UHMWPE materials perform according as expected, the benefits would include longer-lasting implants that are less prone to mechanically-induced failure. The composite materials would therefore require fewer revision procedures and maintain functionality longer, a critical need as life expectancy increases are causing people to outlive their implants."
"9581131","Abstract One important yet understudied aspect in nanomaterial applications is the cell biology of nanomaterial transport into cells and through tissues. To overcome the cell membranes and reach their sites of action within, nanomaterials are often complexed with targeting ligands, such as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), to engage with cell surface receptors. The receptor-mediated cell entry is also advantageous in concentrating more nanomaterials into certain cell or tissue types (e.g. tumors). However, the cellular machineries that mediate and/or regulate the cargo transport after receptor binding remain to be further elucidated. In this proposal, I aim to decode the cellular machinery of one such cell entry pathway, macropinocytosis (MP).  MP has relatively large endocytic vacuoles (>200 nm in diameter) and thus can more readily engulf cargo as large as nanoparticles. However, MP pathway, especially receptor-mediated ones, has remained elusive due to the lack of specific tracers. Recent studies on CPPs, including ours, have shed new light in this problem by discovering two novel receptor-mediated MP processes, which are initiated by peptide ligation with either heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans or another cell surface protein, neuropilin-1 (NRP1). We further showed that NRP1 and HS pathways are two functionally distinct subtypes of receptor-mediated MP, and generated peptide tools to exclusively trace one or the other of these two pathways. In the Aim 1, I will perform a genome-wide RNAi screening to identify genes and signaling cascades that play essential roles in initiating and regulating receptor-mediated MP. Silver-based nanoparticles coated with NRP1- or HS-binding peptides will be used to probe NRP1 and HS pathways simultaneously. In the Aim 2, I will determine the regulation of NRP1- and HS-mediated nanomaterial delivery by a variety of Ras oncogenes, which are among the most commonly mutated genes in human cancers. My proposed studies hold great potential for unveiling important cellular machineries for nanomaterial transport, boosting the efficiency of intracellular delivery, and opening the door for personalized nanomaterial delivery and even nanomedicine."
"9504539","Abstract Atherosclerosis, the major common risk factor of coronary artery disease and stroke, is the primary cause of death particularly in the developed world. The pathophysiological mechanisms of atherosclerosis are quite complex, and the inflammatory responses of vascular endothelial cells (ECs), the adhesion and infiltration of monocytes, and the oxidized LDL (ox-LDL)-induced transformation of macrophages (M?) into foam cells are vital events in this process. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the EC inflammation, the monocyte adhesion to ECs, and the activation/function of M? especially factors regulating these processes in atherosclerosis remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data strongly support that dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a novel regulator for EC inflammation/monocyte adhesion/M? activation/function in atherogenesis. DOCK2 is essential for ox-LDL- or TNF-?-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules like IL-6, MCP-1, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in ECs, suggesting that DOCK2 mediates the EC inflammation. In addition, DOCK2 deficiency (DOCK2-/-) inhibits TNF-?-induced human monocyte adhesion to ECs and blocks M? activation/function. Moreover, DOCK2-/- decreases macrophage phagocytosis through the suppression of scavenger receptor A (SR-A) and SR-B (CD36). In vivo, DOCK2 is induced in both mouse and human atherosclerotic lesion ECs and other cells. DOCK2-/- in mice significantly attenuates the lesion size, M? infiltration, and the expression of adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines including NF-?B, the most common regulator of inflammation in atherosclerosis. These findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that DOCK2 promotes the development of atherosclerosis through mediating EC inflammation, monocyte adhesion to ECs as well as M? function, which will be tested by three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will establish the role of DOCK2 in atherosclerosis formation in vivo by examining the modulation of EC inflammation/phenotype. In Aim 2 we will test whether DOCK2 mediates monocyte adhesion to ECs by regulating endothelial inflammation and adhesion molecule expression; and in Aim 3 we will determine if DOCK2 regulates the development of atherosclerosis through mediating M? activation/function. Completion of the proposed studies will establish the pivotal role of DOCK2 and the underlying novel mechanisms controlling the development and progression of atherosclerosis, which may ultimately contribute to the development of novel therapeutics for treating atherosclerosis."
"9438516","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension affects 60 million adults in the United States, and is a major independent risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure, and a major cause of end-stage renal disease. More than half of hypertensive patients have a salt-sensitive component, and in approximately 30%, hypertension is predominantly due to abnormalities in sodium handling by the kidney. The kinases SPAK and OSR1 play important roles in the regulation of renal sodium transport. In vitro, both kinases activate the sodium transporters NKCC2 and NCC, but little is known about the pathways via which SPAK and OSR1 activate them in whole animals. Studies in mice indicate that OSR1 is more important for activation of NKCC2, while SPAK is the main activator of NCC. Recent evidence shows that multiple forms of SPAK and OSR1 exist in the kidney, some of which inhibit sodium transport, contrary to the prevailing view that SPAK and OSR1 only activate it. Stimuli that lower blood pressure (e.g. dietary salt restriction), or administration of hormones that increase blood pressure (e.g. aldosterone, vasopressin and angiotensin II), reduce the levels of inhibitory SPAK and OSR1, but increase levels of activating forms. Regulation of renal sodium transport and blood pressure by SPAK and OSR1 is thus more complex than previously believed. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which SPAK and OSR1 regulate renal sodium transport. The R01 Grant application will provide the necessary resources for the principal investigator to test the hypothesis that SPAK and OSR1 isoforms differentially regulate renal sodium transport, and differentially mediate responses to physiological stimuli that alter blood pressure. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 is to examine the mechanisms by which SPAK and OSR1 isoforms differentially regulate renal sodium transport. The mechanisms by which SPAK and OSR1 isoforms inhibit activity of NKCC2 will be determined using Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. Aim 2 is to identify the physiological factors that modulate isoform expression. Using wild-type, SPAK knockout and renal OSR1 knockout mice, the effects of sodium restriction, aldosterone infusion and induced-hypertension on the levels and renal localization of SPAK and OSR1 isoforms, as well as the mechanism and timing of these effects, will be determined. Aim 3 is to examine how SPAK and OSR1 regulate renal sodium transport and blood pressure in whole animals. The effects of acute and chronic aldosterone, vasopressin or angiotensin II administration on NCC and NKCC2 phosphorylation and activity will be determined in wild-type, SPAK knockout and renal OSR1 knockout mice. Mice lacking both SPAK and OSR1 in the kidney will also be characterized. These studies will enable us to assign specific physiological functions to either SPAK or OSR1 isoforms, a significant advance towards understanding how two closely related kinases that activate the same targets in vitro have very different roles in vivo. In addition, we will gain insight into the pathways that activate cation cotransporters independently of SPAK/OSR1."
"9442822","SUMMARY In humans, the number of annotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) is almost three times that of protein coding transcripts, yet fewer than 50 of these have been functionally characterized. A major challenge in all fields of biology is to investigate how these mysterious RNAs regulate gene expression and biological pathways, and to integrate the results of these findings into current paradigms. The field of lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis has lagged behind in these efforts. We are attempting to bridge this conceptual gap by investigating the role of lncRNA in regulating cholesterol metabolism and atherogenesis. To date, the functions of lncRNAs have proven difficult to dissect, in part because unlike microRNAs, lncRNAs lack unifying features (other than length), and they can form numerous types of interactions, including RNA- RNA, RNA-DNA or RNA-protein. As such, each lncRNA studied presents new and unique challenges that require the flexibility to change course or pursue new directions as they arise. This project is thus ideal for support by the NHLBI's Outstanding Investigator Award Program. As described in this application, we have recently discovered primate-specific lncRNAs that regulate cholesterol efflux, HDL biogenesis and inflammatory signaling, and we are further characterizing their function. Our exciting findings illustrate the tremendous potential for discovery in this area. Notably, these primate-specific lncRNAs are not conserved in other mammals, highlighting the importance of further studies of human lncRNAs and their functions. We are now pursuing other novel lncRNAs and micropeptides that function in human cardiovascular health and disease, studies that will lead to better understanding of the molecular regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and atherosclerosis, as well as the identification of novel prognostic/diagnostic approaches and therapeutic targets."
"9635590","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Periodontitis, or gum disease, affects approximately 50% of the adult population in the United States and can result in tissue damage and bone loss [1,2]. This disease is unusual in that it is not caused by a specific organism, but by a consortia of microbes including opportunistic pathogens and commensals [2]. The complex interactions between oral microbes influence the progression and severity of disease, as well as its resistance to treatment [3?7]. Studying these interactions in vivo is challenging, hindering our ability to understand periodontal disease. Productive approaches to characterize polymicrobial interactions have included the use of model oral communities and animal models of periodontitis [5,8?10]. Previously, the Whiteley lab used these approaches to identify cross-feeding and cross-respiration mediated interactions between the opportunistic pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and the oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii (Sg) [6,11,12]. In addition, these interactions increase Aa?s resistance to certain components of the innate immune system [8]. In this study, the overarching hypothesis is that metabolic interactions impact the survival of pathogens in the oral cavity. This proposal aims to expand our understanding of oral polymicrobial interactions in two significant ways. First, it proposes to characterize how interactions between Aa and Sg alter the ability of Aa to resist the innate immune system, antimicrobial compounds, and the invasion of other oral microbes using a combination of in vitro manipulations and transposon sequencing (Aim 1). Second, this proposal aims to use the framework developed in characterizing the interactions between Aa and Sg as a model to identify metabolically-driven interactions between Aa and a diverse set of microbes (Aim 2). The metabolic impact of interactions will be characterized by comparing the genes necessary for Aa fitness in co-culture in a murine abscess model of infection with those necessary in vitro in chemically defined manipulations. This Aim will also serve to improve the functional annotation of the Aa genome, and potentially genomes of other closely-related clinically relevant microbes in the Pasteurellaceae family, including Haemophilus. Overall, the proposed research will greatly expand our understanding of how metabolic interactions in the oral cavity influence the persistence of pathogens during periodontitis."
"9453232","Circadian rhythms regulate human behavior and physiology within the 24 hour day to optimize processes, from gene expression to cognition. Dysregulation of those rhythms are associated with sleep disorders, cognitive and physical performance, cancer, and chronic metabolic and neurologic disease. Despite the importance of circadian rhythms to human health and their fundamental role demonstrated in model organisms, little is known about the biological connection between human circadian rhythms and our health and physiology. We propose to identify novel genetic factors involved in circadian rhythms by sequencing extreme circadian rhythm disorder patients from clinical cohorts (n~200). Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASPS) and Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) are inherited neurological sleep disorders of the circadian clock, which present as extremely shifted sleep timing. Familial studies identified mutations in genes encoding molecular components of the circadian clock (PER2, PER3) or regulating the speed/pace of the clock (CSNK1D), causing extreme advance or delay in sleep onset. We hypothesize that ASPS and DSPS subjects harbor rare loss-of-function mutations in components of the circadian clock, including input/output pathways and the core molecular clock. This hypothesis will be tested in 2 specific aims: Aim 1 will identify genetic variants robustly associated with Advanced and Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome in clinical cohorts. I will learn phenotyping of circadian disorders and exome sequencing and analysis. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms underlying the disease process by determining the function of ASPS and DSPS genetic mutations on cellular circadian rhythms and screening for novel therapeutic compounds. Through Aim 2 I will develop skills in circadian cell culture assays and associated analysis techniques, as well as learn compound screening. The results of this study will identify new causal genetic factors for ASPS and DSPS. Through these results we will elucidate novel genes and pathways underlying circadian regulation. These findings will open potential new avenues of therapeutics for rare circadian rhythms disorders, increase our understanding of the basic mechanisms of circadian biology, and open new avenues for treatment of more common circadian rhythm associated chronic diseases. To achieve my long-term career goal to be one of the leading human geneticists in the field of chronobiology, I will expand my current expertise in genome-wide studies of common variation in complex traits into circadian clinical sample phenotyping and exome sequencing identification of causal rare variants to achieve my career goal. The research proposed in this K01 will serve as an essential stepping stone to acquire this training."
"9664234","Abstract  This project is a focused on the continuation of the epidemiological research capability of the Centers for Autism and Developmental Disabilities Epidemiology (CADDRE) network with implementation of Phase 3 of the Study to Explore Early Development. The ongoing objectives of the SEED study are to characterize the autism behavioral phenotype and associated developmental, medical and behavioral conditions of autism. and to understand the genetic and environmental risk factors of Autism. The aims of this application are as follows: 1. Implement a third Phase of the SEED study preserving the core study design with enhancements to improve recruitment and a reduction in the data collection protocol in a new Midwestern SEED site. The following aspects of the core study design will be preserved in Phase 3: a) a case-control study design with multiple- source ascertainment of an ASD case group, a non- ASD developmental disability (DD) comparison group and a population-based (POP) comparison group, b) clinical confirmation of developmental status of all participants using a standardized assessment protocol, and c) collection of clinical, genetic and environmental data. Recruitment enhancements will include active follow-up procedures for invited participants. Data collection will be streamlined, compared to Phase 2, primarily by eliminating pediatric and neonatal medical record abstraction for all three participant groups and curtailing data collected for the DD comparison group. 2. Further increase the total SEED pooled sample size to enhance SEED's analytic potential to investigate rare exposures and ASD subtypes by achieving complete data collection on 125 ASD children, 125 DD children and 125 POP children within our site. Reaching these targets at all anticipated Phase 3 sites will increase the total SEED ASD sample to approximately 2000 children which will enhance the examination of rare exposures and modest associations potentially relevant to the etiology of ASD."
"9522727","PROJECT SUMMARY Soil transmitted helminth infections remain one of the most neglected groups of infectious diseases and one of the greatest public health challenges worldwide, with an estimated two billion people infected. Importantly, recovery from helminth infection involves not only clearance of the parasite, but also successful repair of the inflamed, damaged intestine in order to restore tissue protection and these mechanisms of tissue protection are often conserved across non-infectious intestinal diseases. Thus, the development of successful immuno- therapies against soil-transmitted helminth parasites requires a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that regulate both infection-induced immunity and intestinal tissue protection. This proposal will interrogate the role of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in promoting anti-helminth immunity and regulating infectious and non-infectious intestinal tissue protection via activation of the amphiregulin (AREG)-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. In preliminary studies, we found that deletion of AREG resulted in dysregulated immune responses, impaired worm expulsion and failed intestinal repair following helminth infection. Critically, the importance of this pathway was not limited to pathogen infection, as AREG expression was also elevated in a murine model of non-infectious intestinal damage, and disruption in AREG-EGFR interactions resulted in exacerbated intestinal inflammation and impaired intestinal repair. We further identified ILC2s as a key source of this growth factor and found that therapeutic transfer of ILC2s or AREG protein can limit inflammation and promote tissue protection in mice. Despite these advances, the factors that regulate intestinal AREG responses, the cell-intrinsic requirements for AREG expression, the downstream mechanisms by which AREG influences epithelial cell responses, and whether differential AREG expression in humans is associated with intestinal inflammation, all remain unknown. Employing new in vivo tools, this competitive grant renewal will focus on delineating: (i) the signals and cell-intrinsic requirements for AREG in promoting immunity to helminth infection and restoration of intestinal tissue protection, (ii) the mechanisms by which ILC2-AREG regulates intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) progenitors to promote tissue protection, and (iii), whether therapeutic delivery of rAREG can reverse established chronic intestinal tissue damage and inflammation and restore tissue protection. We anticipate that defining the mechanisms by which the ILC2-AREG-EGFR pathway regulates both intestinal immunity and tissue protection is critical for the design of new immunologic intervention strategies to treat and prevent helminth infections and non-infectious inflammatory diseases such as IBD. !"
"9622383","PROJECT ABSTRACT Metabolism provides the energy and building blocks necessary for all cellular functions. A breakdown in metabolic function can give rise to devastating diseases, including cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. Yet, we have only a limited understanding of metabolic processes in individual living cells and tissues. The largest roadblock has been a general lack of tools for measuring metabolic transients that have high temporal and spatial resolution and also maintain the integrity of the cell. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors (GEFBs) have begun to bridge this gap. However, many first- generation GEFBs are still tremendously challenging or impractical to use due to low signal-to- noise (SNR), suboptimal dynamic and sensing ranges, and dependence on pH. The inherent slowness of the current approach to optimizing GEFBs has significantly hindered progress in this area. The proposed research seeks to overcome this critical barrier in the field of metabolism by establishing two new methods that will dramatically accelerate the development of biosensors optimized for use in living cells: Aim 1) a high-throughput, high- content screen for rapid optimization of GEFBs; and Aim 2) a multiple cloning toolkit for quick construction of novel dimerization-dependent GEFBs. The results of this work will help drive significant progress in the field of metabolism, and the GEFBs generated using these methods will be broadly applicable in multiple cell types, including neurons, cardiac and skeletal myocytes, and pancreatic ? cells."
"9416940","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ACL reconstruction can reliably restore knee stability and allow competitive and recreational athletes to return to their sports quickly, during the first year after injury. However, the longer-term risk of post-traumatic arthritis is a significant concen for these patients and their physicians. Meniscus tear and cartilage injury have been associated with increased risk of osteoarthritis in ACL reconstruction patients, but previous investigations have been limited by heterogeneous patient populations, poorly validated outcome measures, and retrospective study designs. The aims of this proposal are (1) to determine whether differences in meniscus treatment and articular cartilage status at baseline predict radiographic signs of osteoarthritis two years after ACL reconstruction, (2) to evaluate the association between instrumented joint laxity and radiographic signs of OA 2 years after ACL reconstruction, and (3) to explore the relationship between arthroscopic treatment at baseline and MRI meniscus and articular cartilage status two years after ACL reconstruction. Along with achieving these aims, the trainee will pursue a training program that will include a combination of didactic activities as well as focused mentorship that complements the research project. The goals for the program will include the following: (1) learn to effectively manage personnel and resources in the conduct of clinical research, (2) improve study design and grant writing skills, (3) develop expertise in the application of statistical modeling to evaluate predictors of prognosi in orthopaedic outcome studies, in particular as it relates to imaging biomarkers, (4) learn to assess the incidence and progression of osteoarthritis using radiographic and MR imaging, (5) learn and apply the principles of responsible conduct of research, and (6) improve manuscript preparation and presentation skills. This mentored training program and research project will enable the trainee to make the transition to independent researcher."
"9600324","Project Summary Metastasis, the dissemination of cells from the primary tumor, is the leading cause of death in cancer patients. For metastatic breast cancer, chemotherapy remains the standard of care. While the benefits of chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic disease have been well documented, over 50% of triple-negative breast cancer patients become resistant to chemotherapy. Increasing our understanding of the mechanisms driving metastasis and drug resistance will help identify biomarkers that can be used to predict them, and characterize targetable signaling pathways to that can be used to prevent them. It is now well appreciated that the tumor microenvironment can contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. The extracellular matrix (ECM), forms a complex scaffold of proteins that provides both structure and signals to the tumor cells. However, its role in driving invasion and metastasis and how it could affect response to chemotherapy remains unexplored. The main goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of the ECM in metastasis and chemo-resistance, using an interdisciplinary approach that will combine cell biology, intravital imaging, systems biology and implantable devices. First, we have shown that gradients of fibronectin can promote directional motility of tumor cells, a process important for metastasis. When highly metastatic tumor cells are subject to gradients of EGF and fibronectin simultaneously, they will invade even more than with each cue alone. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the contribution of ECM versus growth factor cues during local invasion and metastatic colonization. Second, preliminary investigation into the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs on highly invasive tumor cells revealed that they can have differential effects on cell proliferation and migration, and can also regulate ECM sensitivity and organization. In Aim 2, I will identify ECM combinations that affect cell growth and migration in response to clinically relevant chemotherapy regimens and perform a CRISPR knockout screen of ECM-regulator proteins to identify novel genes regulating chemo-sensitivity. I also propose an extensive training program that will support my transition to independence. The research environment provided by the Koch Institute at MIT is outstanding, and offers unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, collaboration between biologists and engineers, and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team to help me achieve my goals: Prof. Frank Gertler, expert in cell motility, and Prof. Michael Hemann, expert in studying mechanisms of drug resistance will be my mentors. Prof. Richard Hynes, a pioneer in ECM research, and Prof. Doug Lauffenburger, leader in cancer systems biology, will be collaborators and members of my mentoring committee. My training will also involve mentoring students, attending and presenting my work at meetings to become an active member of the ECM and cancer communities, and science outreach. Together, the proposed studies and career development training will ensure I achieve my goal of establishing a successful, independently-funded lab at a major university."
"9415031","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cystinosis is a metabolic hereditary disease characterized by intracellular accumulation of cystine. Affected individuals typically present with proximal tubulopathy before one year of age and eventually progress to end- stage renal failure. Cystine accumulation also leads to multi-organ dysfunction. Using the mouse model for cystinosis, the Ctns-/- mice, we showed that transplantation of wildtype Sca1+ HSC expressing Ctns resulted in dramatic reductions of tissue cystine content and long-term of kidney preservation. Within the scope of the original R01-DK090058 grant, we optimized a protocol to obtain efficient HSC transduction and showed that ex vivo transduced HSCs using our lentiviral vector construct, pCCL-CTNS, were also capable of decreasing cystine content in all tissues and improved kidney function in Ctns-/- mice. After submitting a pre-Investigator New Drug (IND) application to Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we are now conducting the pharmacology/toxicology studies required for inclusion in an IND for a phase I clinical trial for autologous gene- modified-HSC transplantation for cystinosis. While this work offers new hope for the treatment of cystinosis, we are proposing to investigate two critical questions for the future clinical application of this strategy. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate if the second CTNS isoform, CTNSLKG, would improve the actual gene therapy strategy. Cystinosin-LKG is found in the lysosomes and at the plasma membrane but its function is unknown. However, CTNSLKG has been found highly expressed in PTCs and other cell types that depend on vesicular trafficking and that correlate with cystinosis clinical features including the Fanconi syndrome. We also recently showed that vesicular trafficking was impaired in cystinosis cells. Thus, our hypothesis is that cystinosinLKG is involved in vesicular trafficking of transporters at the apical membrane of the PTCs and that introduction of the two CTNS isoforms via stem cell therapy would augment the therapeutic impact especially the kidney function. If so, these data will serve as the basis for modifying subsequent clinical trial strategies submitted to the FDA but may also elucidate the pathogenesis of the Fanconi syndrome in cystinosis that has remained a mystery all these years despite considerable scientific investigation. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate if the patients homozygote for the 57-kb deletion, the most common mutation in cystinosis, can be treated with autologous HSC transplantation. Indeed, this large deletion also removes the adjacent Carbohydrate kinase-like (CARKL) gene encoding the sedoheptulokinase (SHPK). While the absence of this gene does not have an obvious consequence on disease phenotype, SHPK has been recently shown to control macrophage differentiation. Since we recently showed that macrophages play a key role in tissue repair in cystinosis after HSC transplantation, it is critical to verify that the absence of CARKL gene will not impact our stem cell treatment strategy. This work s critical for the future clinical trial for cystinosis but alsowill advance the understanding on macrophage-mediated tissue repair and the role of CARKL in this process."

"9452118","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prefrontal cortical (PFC) circuit dysfunction has emerged as a central pathological finding in depression and other stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, and has been linked to characteristic deficits in regulating attention, reward processing, and executive control. All of these functions depend on working memory: a process that supports the short-term storage and manipulation of information, despite interference from competing, task-irrelevant information. Working memory is mediated in part by PFC pyramidal neurons, which exhibit sustained activity during active maintenance of a memory trace. This unusual capacity for sustained, internally generated activity is thought to emerge from the precisely coordinated activity of excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, but the microcircuit-level mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Understanding how these cells interact in the service of working memory-and how they are disrupted in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders-are fundamental challenges for systems neuroscience. Here, we will use optogenetic tools and two-photon (2P) calcium imaging to quantify and manipulate neural activity in awake, behaving mice and investigate how pyramidal cells interact with two interneuron subtypes to support working memory. Next, we will test the hypothesis that chronic stress disrupts these interactions, altering the balance of excitation and inhibition in PF microcircuits and impairing working memory. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that these effects are driven at the molecular level by deficits in BDNF-mediated plasticity mechanisms for maintaining synaptic homeostasis. The results of this work will advance our understanding of how prefrontal microcircuits support working memory, a core component of multiple psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. They may also inform future efforts to design new interventions targeting dysfunction in specific neuronal subtypes in mood and anxiety disorders."

"9445464","PROJECT SUMMARY Long spans of tandemly arrayed, highly repetitive sequences known as satellite repeats form an important and underexplored component of eukaryotic genomes. These satellite regions play vital roles especially in centromere and telomere function, and their dysregulation has been associated with several human genetic disorders. The repetitive nature of satellite sequences render them nearly impossible to assemble, thwarting efforts at further analysis. We have devised a pair of approaches that lets us explore patterns of kmer ?word? repeats and large-scale structures from unassembled reads to quantitatively describe the satellite repeat composition of a genome. We have discovered that these features are highly variable across lines, opening the door to understanding how satellite repeat variability evolves and how it impacts the biology of the organism. In Specific Aim 1 we will characterize the patterns and rates of turnover of satellite repeats in Drosophila. We will apply our novel computational methods to quantitatively characterize satellite repeats using DNA sequence data from population re-sequencing surveys and reference genomes of Drosophila species. Long- read sequences from PacBio runs and using GemCode technology from 10x Genomics will allow anchoring of a subset of repeats to neighboring euchromatin. These data will allow us to identify and quantitate satellite repeats, determine their species distribution, and infer rates of change and inter-satellite correlations within species and along the phylogeny. We apply Gaussian process models to recapitulate the rates and patterns of change of satellite repeats in fly genomes, and test whether patterns of satellite repeats are consistent with models of mutation-drift balance. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine mutational profiles of satellite DNA changes in mutation-accumulation lines of Drosophila. Satellite repeats display rapid turnover across closely related species, which motivates examining whether a purely mutational process is driving the evolutionary divergence. By contrasting satellites from genomes of flies derived from mutation accumulation lines, we will quantify key attributes of the mutational divergence. We will also construct reversible mutants of Su(var)3-9, which is required for heterochromatin maintenance, and test its effects as a sensitized background for mutation accumulation. In Specific Aim 3 we will test models of centromere- and telomere-drive by scoring segregation in F1s that have large differences in satellite repeat abundances. During female meiosis, any factor with an increased chance of ending up in an ovum instead of a polar body will have great evolutionary advantage. Prior publications suggest that such meiotic distorters play a role in shaping the evolution and distribution of satellite repeats. We will make F1 females in crosses between lines with specific differences in satellite repeats, and then score the progeny of these F1 females by sequencing to search genome-wide for distortions from Mendelian segregation. In sum, this project leverages novel analytical approaches to address long-standing and fundamental questions about satellite repeat evolution."

Such a multivalent vaccine would also provide protection against emerging pathogens that have acquired new virulence factors such as the Shiga toxin-expressing EAEC German outbreak strain. These enteropathogens are all Category B risk agents of biodefense concern. A vaccine with broad coverage against this group would be beneficial to multiple segments of the US population, including: 1) adult and child travelers who visit less developed countries where these infections are hyperendemic; 2) children in certain high risk areas of the US; 3) and for mass immunization in the face a natural or deliberate outbreak scenario. Immunization by the mucosal route is an effective method for induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses, believed to be important in protection against these enteropathogens. Our successful completion of 5 attenuated Shigella live vector strains during the Mid- Atlantic RCE (MARCE) funding period, provides the platform for the expression of protective antigens from each enteropathogen. Chromosomal insertion technology and autotransporter-based surface expression of heterologous antigens will ensure stability of vaccine constructs and optimal presentation to the host. In order to confirm the safety, immunogenicity and protective capacity of the multivalent vaccine, we have recruited expert collaborators who have developed innovative, relevant animal models for each component enteropathogen. These studies will constitute preclinical evaluations necessary for advancement to clinical trials. The multivalent vaccine will be tested in the neonatal mouse model in order to assess its utility in the very young thus expanding the potential target population age range. At the completion of these studies, we expect to have completed the construction and testing of a multivalent vaccine consisting of a mixture of live attenuated Shigella strains expressing critical antigens from ETEC, STEC and EAEC that will be broadly protective against enteric infections with these pathogens. The genetic related of these pathogens makes them well suited for grouping in this vaccine strategy that represents an important part of the overall program to develop an Immunoprophylactic Strategy to Control Emerging Enteric Infections."
"9412147","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Probiotics are microorganisms that when consumed confer a positive or beneficial effect on the host. Use of probiotics in the oral cavity as preventative therapies are just beginning to be explored for dental caries and periodontal disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) is an important organism in the onset and progression of periodontal disease. Current treatment for Pg associated periodontitis is largely based on treatment of symptoms rather than preventative therapies. We have isolated several probiotic strains of Lactobacillus delbreuckii from dairy products that inhibit Pg-induced cytotoxicity and Pg growth in vitro. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that supernatants derived from these strains of L. delbreuckii inhibit Pg growth. Initial testing indicates that the inhibitory molecule appears to be a protein with a molecular weight between 30-100 kDa. We propose to isolate and identify the secreted factor from L. delbreuckii by anion/cation exchange chromatography and mass spectrometry. Using this data, we will identify the genomic location encoding the inhibitory factor. We will clone and purify a recombinant inhibitory factor to carry out further testing. Using a previously constructed transposon library in Pg, we will use massively parallel sequencing technology to quickly and quantitatively screen for genes in Pg that interact with the inhibitory supernatant and/or recombinant inhibitory protein to quickly identify potential mechanisms of action. Lastly, we will examine the susceptibility profile of clinical isolates of Pg and other oral bacteria to L. delbreuckii inhibitory supernatants and/or purified recombinant inhibitory protein in an effort to determine spectrum of action of the L. delbreuckii inhibitor against clinical Pg isolates. Completion of the aims outlined in this application may identify a novel interspecies inhibitory mechanism and demonstrate the feasibility of a clinical application for our L. delbreuckii probiotic strains and/or their secreted products."
"9541556","Project Summary/Abstract  Ataxia (uncoordinated movement) is a debilitating disorder that interferes patients' ability to perform activities of daily living. Ataxia is caused by dysfunction of the cerebellum, a brain area involved in motor coordination and maintenance of balance. There are few therapies available for treatment of ataxia, and the ones used, such as serotoninergic agents, have limited efficacy often only in a subset of patients. Thus, there is a real need for new and improved therapeutic approaches for the management and treatment of ataxia.  A major cause of cerebellar dysfunction is abnormal Purkinje cell activity. Purkinje cells, the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, are intrinsically active cells that integrate synaptic input from over 150,000 parallel fiber synapses and one climbing fiber. Serotonin (5-HT) has excitatory, inhibitory, or biphasic effects on firing rate of Purkinje cells. Similarly, serotonin depresses and potentiates parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synaptic transmission, and affects the climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synaptic transmission. The mechanisms by which serotonin causes these opposing effects are not understood. Nevertheless, because serotoninergic drugs are promising for the treatment of ataxia, it is important to delineate the mechanism by which they modulate cerebellar function. Serotoninergic drugs that have been most efficacious in lessening motor dysfunction were chosen to target the 5-HT1A receptor. However, these drugs can also activate 5-HT7 receptors. In the cerebellar cortex, 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors are localized only to Purkinje cells and parallel fibers. Because 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors typically have opposing effects on firing and synaptic transmission, it is plausible that the limited efficacy of serotoninergic drugs used to treat ataxia is due to activation of multiple receptors that elicit opposing effects on cerebellar function. Thus, in order to improve the therapeutics for ataxia, it is important to delineate how serotonin alters cerebellar function. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate how selective activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors alters Purkinje cell intrinsic firing and excitatory synaptic transmission onto Purkinje cells. To do so, this proposal uses electrophysiology to record from Purkinje cells in acutely prepared cerebellar slices. Aim 1 elucidates how selective 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptor activation affects Purkinje cell intrinsic firing. In addition, we will examine the therapeutic efficacy of selective serotonergic agonists that alter Purkinje cell activity in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Aim 2 delineates the effect of selective 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptor activation on parallel fiber and climbing fiber synaptic transmission, the pre- or post-synaptic components of any potential modulation, and long-term plasticity. Successful completion of this proposal will reveal the actions of clinically-relevant serotoninergic receptors and shed light on the regulatory role of the potent neuromodulator serotonin in the cerebellum. Furthermore, as we gain a better understanding of cerebellar function in different types of ataxia, and how serotonin modulates the cerebellar cortex, future studies will be better poised to design rational therapies to treat ataxia."
"9631557","Project Summary Abstract Building on our 25-year track record in comprehensive genomic studies and addressing NHGRI's goal for this RFA, we propose to create, apply and test a powerful, reliable and general strategy for ?comprehensive? identification of risk and protective variants that contribute significantly to any common disease of interest. Toward this end, we will:  · Create a Common Disease Consortium (CDC) that brings together a collaborative network of investigators with deep clinical and genetic expertise and >1.1 million well-characterized samples (cases and controls) across diverse populations, including Europeans, African Americans, Hispanics and Asians. The CDC will undertake genetic studies under three major projects related to: (1) Five systemic diseases ? early-onset coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, atrial fibrillation, and stroke; (2) Three severe neurological disorders ? autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy; and (3) Two countries with special advantages for genetic studies ? Finland and Estonia. Through these three projects, the CDC will explore a range of study designs, population-genetic strategies, genetic architectures, and diverse populations.  · Sequence 450,000 samples from the CDC, using the expertise of the Broad Institute's genomics platform to generate high quality data and to drive down sequencing costs.  · Analyze the sequence data to elucidate the genetic basis of the diseases, by applying state- of-the-art methods from in our preliminary studies and developing new methods to increase power to detect association.  · Create, disseminate and share data, tools, and resources, to enable the scientific community to access and analyze genetic studies from the CDC and other sources."
"9459409","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and elevated blood lipid levels are the strongest risk factor. The goal of this R01 proposal is to identify genes and genetic variants associated with blood lipid levels to inform our understanding of the biology of lipids and cardiovascular disease and identify new targets for therapies for cardiovascular disease. Our research team combines strengths in cardiovascular disease, high-throughput genetics and genomics and development and application of innovative computational and statistical methods. In Aim 1, we will assess ~40m genetic variants for association in very large samples after imputation from large, sequenced reference panels. We expect to meta-analyze data for ~400,000 individuals. In Aim 2, we will examine coding variation for association with blood lipid levels, with a particular focus on low frequency variation that cannot be imputed well in GWAS cohorts. We anticipate the exome survey will include data for ~300,000 individuals from different ancestries. In Aim 3, we will evaluate rare and novel variation, not reachable using chip or imputation-based approaches, by leveraging exome or whole genome sequence data from 10,000s sequenced samples. In Aim 4, we will examine null alleles in lipid- associated genes we identify in coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction case-control studies, to better understand their role in cardiovascular disease and as potential drug targets. We are leaders in the development and implementation of tools, methods and websites for statistical analysis of genetic data and sharing of study results. Here, we will also develop a web portal to facilitate public sharing, interpretation, and experimental follow-up of results from our genetic discovery aims. Funding this proposal will allow continued effort and co-ordination of the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC). Completion of our aims will provide new insights into disease mechanisms that have the potential to catalyze breakthroughs in prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and may serve as a model for other large-scale genetic studies."
"9471560","ABSTRACT Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) remains a leading cause of permanent neurodevelopmental disability. Diagnosis is often initiated by a distinctive craniofacial appearance that originates, in part, from the apoptotic deletion of craniofacial progenitors, a stem cell lineage called the Neural Crest. In the prior award period, our transcriptome analysis revealed that gene clusters mediating Ribosome Biogenesis (RBG; 70 genes, all repressed) and Oxidative Phosphorylation (OxP; 60 genes, all repressed) exhibited the greatest differential expression 6hr following transient alcohol exposure (52mM, 90min). These gene clusters also had the greatest altered expression in genetic lineages of neural crest having differential vulnerability to alcohol, and haploinsufficiency in RBG sensitized neural crest to alcohol-induced apoptosis and facial deficits. Here, we test the hypothesis that disruption of RBG is mechanistic in alcohol's facial dysmorphology. Aim 1 shows that alcohol reduces RBG and causes a nucleolar stress which then activates MDM2/p53-mediated apoptosis in neural crest. Aim 2 shows this loss of RBG is due to alcohol's inactivation of mTORC1 and p70/S6K activity, which are the major transcription-level stimulators of RBG. Aim 3 shows that alcohol inactivates mTORC1 because it depresses mitochondrial OxP and ATP generation and thus activates AMPK, which is a direct repressor of mTORC1. We will also test a role for canonical Wnt/?-catenin signaling, which indirectly stimulates RBG via TSC2 and is repressed by alcohol as we showed in the previous award period. Because RBG consumes ~80% of total ATP generation in rapidly dividing cells like neural crest, cells have coopted RBG to monitor their internal stress and have linked it to the p53-checkpoint pathway. In humans, impaired RBG is now understood to underlie a family of genetic syndromes featuring facial anomalies with similarities to those of FASD; these ribosomopathies cause the p53-mediated deletion of neural crest progenitors and are rescued by TORC1 activation. Studies in this proposal test the novel hypothesis that the facial deficits in FASD represent a ribosomopathy and establish the mechanism by which alcohol initiates the pro-apoptotic nucleolar stress in neural crest progenitors."
"9598087","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma incidence has increased in the last 30 years and over 800,000 people have a previous diagnosis of melanoma in the US. Melanoma has a high likelihood to metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) and accounts for 80% of the skin cancer-related deaths. As a result, many melanoma survivors constantly fear when their cancers might come back and spread. Currently, there is no active means to prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis for melanoma survivors. Evidence strongly suggests that inflammation is associated with unfavorable clinical prognosis such as tumor progression and recurrence. We have found that human metastatic melanoma cells show a special form of inflammatory response called autoinflammation because of constant activation of a unique inflammatory platform called inflammasome. This autoinflammation is mediated by IL-1?, a pro-inflammatory cytokine inducing a large portfolio of genes. EGCG is an active ingredient in green tea and has many biological effects including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pathogen properties. Because many inflammatory mediators reported to be inhibited by EGCG are controlled by active IL-1? (secreted form), we hypothesized that EGCG might inhibit IL-1? activation, thereby controlling other mediators that are important for tumor progression and metastasis. We indeed found that a practical and physiologically achievable dose of EGCG (1 µM) suppresses IL-1? secretion in human metastatic melanoma cells that carry a feature of autoinflammation. We propose to explore the molecular mechanisms of action of a practical dose of EGCG in regulating IL-1? activation in human metastatic melanoma in vitro, and analyze the effects of EGCG on a tumor cell population [putative cancer stem cell (CSC) population] that has a high tendency to initiate tumor formation and recurrence. We also propose to study the biological effects of EGCG on melanoma recurrence using a spontaneous metastasis model in vivo. We will use patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) model (avatar model), one of the best models in human cancer research that recapitulates complex tumor microenvironment. We will also use cells from a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of metastasizing melanoma. PDX and GEM tumor cells will be labeled with a modified labeling method with enhanced brightness, high detection sensitivity, high transduction efficiency and stable labeling. State-of-the-art multimodality imaging will be used to longitudinally monitor tumor recurrence at the initial tumor site, lymph nodes and distant metastatic sites. Tumor cells will be examined to define the effects of EGCG on IL-1? pathway, CSC traits, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Because IL-1? plays a critical role in tumor progression, such studies will elucidate the mechanisms of action of EGCG on regulating dysregulated cytokines in cancers and will lead to the development of effective chemopreventive agents with limited to no toxicity that can be taken by cancer survivors to control tumor recurrence and prolong their lives."
"9461666","Real Time Phylogeny and Contact Tracing to Disrupt HIV Transmission Kantor, Rami MD SUMMARY Prevention of HIV transmission is still a major global challenge, and innovative methods are needed for its disruption. Though actual transmission networks are unknown, characterizing social and phylogenetic networks can guide prevention interventions. Contact tracing is the current public health tool to derive social networks and identify, notify, test and link to care partners of newly-diagnosed HIV cases. Phylogenetic analysis of available sequences is used in research to characterize epidemics and has facilitated outbreak investigations. However, real time integration of phylogenetics with contact tracing on a public health, state- wide level has not been evaluated. We propose to prospectively integrate phylogenetic analysis with contact tracing in real time, and evaluate the impact of such integration on HIV infection in Rhode Island (RI). We hypothesize that real time use of information from phylogenetic inference can enhance contact tracing, improve HIV testing, diagnoses and linkage to care, and disrupt transmission. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Conduct real time phylogenetic analyses of patient-level sequence data; (2) Augment phylogenetic inference by increased sampling and more comprehensive testing; and (3) Evaluate the benefit of real time integration of phylogenetics with contact tracing efforts. We will develop and automate tools to incorporate phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference into contact tracing, explore its enhancement, and evaluate its real time impact, with special consideration of key populations like men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users and persons with HIV drug resistance. We expect that this approach will improve identification and linkage to care of infected-unaware individuals, infected-aware individuals not linked to care, and uninfected individuals that are at high risk of infection. The main premise of this proposal is that phylogenetic networks contain information which can expand social networks and impact HIV transmission. If our hypothesis is correct, this research will have high impact on HIV prevention and the care continuum and disrupt HIV transmission in Rhode Island. The rigor of our research approach is strengthened by our multidisciplinary team of clinicians, public health officials, statisticians, bioinformaticians, evolutionary and molecular biologists, combined with our relevant existing data and expertise, the small size of the state and the strong and close academic-public health partnership. Furthermore, important and essential ethics considerations are directly addressed and incorporated throughout. Such an approach will make results generalizable and sustainable, allowing focused resource allocation and continuous implementation and generalization of findings. In 2013 the Director of the RI Department of Health declared the vision of ?Getting to Zero? new HIV infections in the state within the next five years, however apparent increases in transmission among high risk networks has impeded progress. This proposal will help bring small RI closer to its goal of being the first state to get to zero new infections and demonstrate how focusing efforts can prevent HIV transmission in RI and beyond."
"9512606","PROJECT SUMMARY Immunotherapies targeting cancer-specific antigens (?neoantigens?) presented by Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC) have high potential for improving rates of long-term, disease-free survival. T cell engineer- ing technologies have found recent success in a limited number of clinical trials, and promise a new era of ef- fective treatments with greatly reduced adverse responses. Unlike melanoma, which neoantigen-targeting therapies have focused, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) have moderate-to-low tumor burdens. Thus they are less likely to present the same types of mutation-bearing antigens on their MHC mole- cules pursued by prior studies. However, new HNSCCs diagnoses are increasingly associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, providing multiple types of alternative, therapeutically useful neoantigens that can be rationally targeted. A broad discovery platform compatible with multiple cancer neoantigen categories, including those induced by HPV, stands to extend T cell engineering approaches to HNSCC. The ultimate goal of this research is to define the broad range of HNSCC neoantigens a patient?s tumor presents on MHC, and the specific T cell receptors that recognize them. The main objectives of this proposal are (i) to compare HPV-dependent HNSCC antigens to other cancer-specific antigens; (ii) to test the extent to which neoantigen presentation can be induced by current HNSCC therapies; and (iii) to characterize the evolution of neoantigen- specific effector T cells and their T cell receptor repertoires in patients undergoing checkpoint blockade (PD1) therapy. In Aim 1, we will extend the approach we previously used to identify lymphoma-specific neoantigens derived from rearrangements of the immunoglobulin gene locus. By evaluating cell lines and primary HNSCC tumors with both DNA sequencing (exome and HPV-focused) and proteomic (protein expression, MHC antigen discovery) technologies, we will evaluate the extent to which HPV is a reliable source of neoantigens relative to other potential sources. De novo peptide sequencing methods we developed will allow us to discover neoanti- gens that would escape conventional proteomic search methods. In Aim 2, we will treat HNSCC cells with ra- diation, cisplatin, and interferon gamma in culture and in patient-derived mouse xenografts. We will monitor changes in neoantigen presentation induced by these treatments with the proteomic technologies used in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will produce synthetic versions of prioritized neoantigens identified from our preliminary data and augmented by those revealed by Aims 1 and 2. We will assemble these with corresponding MHC mole- cules and in a multiplexed fashion, create panels of barcoded MHC tetramer panels. These will be used to profile T lymphocyte populations from HNSCC patients, from which clonal T cell receptors will be sequenced. Thus, our aims relieve the two major obstacles that currently limit neoantigen-targeting immunotherapies: they will provide high-throughput ways to identify HNSCC neoantigens and their cognate T cell receptors. This ap- proach should be broadly applicable to other cancers."
"9612652","Abstract Nucleotide-based drugs, such as antisense (ASO), represent an essential class of drug types that are particularly useful for those so-called ?undruggable? targets by small molecules and antibodies. However, one of the biggest hurdles in the translation of ASO drugs is the poor in vivo delivery. Several barriers exist to prevent ASOs from efficiently reaching their target cells in vivo: rapid renal clearance, nuclease degradation, unspecific absorption, low efficiency to penetrate across the endothelium and spread in extravascular tissue. In this proposal, I aim to apply the technologies of peptide targeting and nanomaterial to enhance the delivery efficiency of ASOs into solid tumors.  To prevent renal filtration and nuclease degradation, ASOs will be encapsulated within porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs). pSiNPs are biodegradable and have low or no toxicity in vivo. More importantly, pSiNPs have likely the highest loading efficiency for ASOs and other oligonucleotides. The most important goal of our proposal is to help ASOs preferentially accumulate in tumors, and penetrate across tumor vessels to access to those target cells far away from the circulation. Our tumor-penetrating CendR peptides are one of the few tools available to achieve this goal. By engaging with certain receptor on the tumor vessels, CendR peptides activate an active transport process across tumor vessels along with a wide range of cargo types, including pSiNPs. In the Aim 1, I will synthesize CendR-functionalized, ASO-loaded pSiNPs. Besides chemical characterization, I will also validate the cell entry and gene-silencing efficacy of this system in vitro. In the Aim 2, I will evaluate the in vivo toxicity, pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution. In the Aim 3, the gene modulation and tumor-inhibitory efficacy of CendR-pSiNP-ASO will be determined using animal tumor models. My proposed studies hold great potential for improving the tumor delivery and antitumor efficacy of ASOs, and accelerating the transition of prototype ASO drugs into the clinic."

Two of these meetings, Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy (OTS) and Microscopy, Histopathology and Analytics (Microscopy) provide broad exposure to a very active multidisciplinary field in biomedical imaging and bioengineering focused on illness treatment and health enhancement. The interdisciplinary nature of the co- located meetings will provide cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between fields with the resulting synergies obtained from such interactions. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students and early career professionals presenting at one of these topical meetings.  OTS will focus on new developments in diffuse optics, spectroscopy and other non- invasive tomographic imaging approaches, including the fields of diffuse optical tomography (DOT), photoacoustic tomography (PAT), optical coherence tomography (OCT), wavefront engineering to overcome scattering, as well as new developments in spectroscopic technologies.  Microscopy will include topics central to the development of optical microscopy and in vitro optical sensing for the clinic. Areas such as novel optical approaches, including computational optics, new image processing and segmentation techniques, development of decision-assistance algorithms via machine-learning and other strategies, testing technologies in pre-clinical models, applications to clinical samples, and validation in the clinic will be discussed. Optically enabled microfluidics are included in this track as well. The goal of these efforts should be towards clinical translation.  The general purpose of these meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work.

"9543057","SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers."
"9489976","Project Summary/Abstract This application is for a shared instrumentation grant from the Light Microscope Imaging Facility at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) School of Medicine (SOM) to acquire a fully automated, high-capacity, high- resolution Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 slide scanner that can accommodate both brightfield and fluorescence imaging in single-slide and double-slide formats. We also request MicroDimensions 3D reconstruction and alignment software packages for manipulating and analyzing the whole slide images produced with the scanner. We need to replace a scanner that is not functioning properly. Our well-established shared core facility supports NIH-funded investigators by giving them access to state-of-the-art microscopy technologies that enhance collaborative, multidisciplinary research. Acquisition of this instrument will have a high impact on the biomedical research at CWRU and expand the scope of our NIH-funded projects. Several projects have been identified that will utilize the scanner and its associated analyses programs. These include: the genetic mechanisms underlying skin fibrosis and cranial bone development (Atit); the mechanisms behind the lifelong functions of transcription factors in axonal growth and architecture (Deneris); deep-learning for histologic image predictors of various diseases (Madabhushi); the development of diagnostic probes to discriminate between glioma subtypes for screening and survival therapies (Brady-Kalnay); the role of progesterone receptors in the control of parturition and the development of therapies to prevent preterm birth (Messiano); the mechanisms by which breast cancer stem cells overcome metastatic latency leading to disease recurrence and the biomarkers that could potentially identify those tumors likely to undergo this process (Schiemann); and the significance of cholesterol-related proteins in brain and retinal function (Pikuleva). Many additional projects of minor users and others at CWRU are anticipated. All of the proposed projects are in need of a high-capacity automated scanner acquiring whole slide images so that analyses can be applied to tissues that cover hundreds of fields of view, rather than the single regions of interest that can be acquired on a standard microscope."
"9537042","ABSTRACT The growing threat of terrorist events involving radiation, as well as the potential for radiation accidents, underscores the need for effective medical countermeasures (MCM) against radiation. The blood-forming system is the most sensitive tissue to radiation, resulting in the hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) after high dose radiation exposures and death from infection and/or bleeding if untreated. Survivors of H-ARS suffer later in life by the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE), a number of chronic illnesses affecting multiple organ systems. To date, Neupogen (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, G-CSF) and Neulasta (pegylated-G-CSF) are the only MCM approved by the FDA for treatment of H-ARS, and will be given as first- line treatments for individuals exposed to high dose radiation. Neither of these MCM, nor any other effective H- ARS MCM to our knowledge, have shown efficacy for DEARE, although cell-based MCM have not yet been evaluated. PLX-R18 cells are a human placental-derived cell product that have been shown to significantly increase survival in H-ARS animal models, and is under development for FDA licensure as a MCM against radiation. Given the efficacy of PLX-R18 to reduce kidney and heart injury in re-perfusion ischemia models, there is rationale that these cells may have efficacy in DEARE also. Most studies testing MCM for H-ARS have used young adult animal models but it is becoming increasingly clear that responses to radiation and MCM are age- dependent, and that MCM that are effective in adults may not be effective in children or the elderly. Thus, MCM for H-ARS should also be tested in pediatric and geriatric animal models. Most animal models are developed in inbred mice, which are similar to ?identical twins? and thus poor models of the human population. Jackson Diversity Outbred (JDO) mice are the most genetically diverse mice available and a more relevant model of humans. The goal of this project is to extend the PLX-R18 H-ARS studies to include examination of survival efficacy in special populations (pediatric an geriatric) and outbred mice, and the ability of PLX-R18 to alleviate DEARE in survivors. We will also examine potential interactions with G-CSF. We hypothesize that PLX-R18 fulfills all the requirements of an ideal MCM and will demonstrate significant survival efficacy in special populations and outbred mice, alleviate some aspects of DEARE in H-ARS survivors, and will not interact negatively with G-CSF when co-administered. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1) evaluate the survival efficacy of PLX-R18 in pediatric and geriatric inbred mouse models and in the JDO mice, 2) explore the interaction of PLX-R18 cells with G-CSF in young adult, pediatric, geriatric, and JDO mice and determine mechanisms of survival efficacy, and 3) investigate the ability of PLX-R18 cells to reduce DEARE in hematopoietic, renal, and cardiovascular systems. Successful completion of this project will extend the scope of PLX-R18 to special populations and in DEARE, and will provide treatment options for special populations exposed to malicious or therapeutic radiation."
"9452084","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is essential for neurodevelopment. If maternal DHA reserves are adequate during pregnancy, at parturition RBC-DHA of the mother would be ? the infant, i.e., DHA equilibrium. Previously, we randomized pregnant women to placebo oil or DHA (600 mg/day). We discovered that the majority of subjects did not achieve DHA equilibrium (5% placebo, 35% DHA), indicating DHA insufficiency, which has been reported to limit infant neurodevelopment. To test whether DHA insufficiency limited fetal neurodevelopment in our sample, we applied an innovative analysis method to estimate fetal brain maturation. Results confirmed that maternal DHA insufficiency significantly constrained fetal autonomic brain age scores (fABAS). Our hypothesis is that many pregnant women fail to get adequate DHA in their diet and that DHA insufficiency constrains fetal and infant neurodevelopment. The long-term goal is to provide the neuroscience to inform public health recommendations related to the use and dose of prenatal DHA supplementation, the influence of dietary fatty acids and the effect on offspring neurodevelopment. This is aligned with the strategic and scientific vision of NICHD and the mission of national and international health organizations that recognize that prenatal exposures set the stage for future health and disease. We propose a randomized Phase III clinical trial of 200 or 800 mg/day DHA during the last two trimesters of pregnancy to achieve these aims: Aim 1) Increase the incidence of DHA equilibrium with 800 mg/day maternal DHA supplementation. Hypothesis: The dosing strategy will result in significant group differences with a higher incidence of DHA equilibrium in the grou receiving 800 mg/day DHA supplementation. Aim 2) Establish whether failure to achieve DHA equilibrium constrains fetal neurodevelopment. Hypothesis: DHA insufficiency will constrain fetal neurodevelopment as evidenced by lower fetal cardiac and brain autonomic indices (HRV, fABAS) at 32 and 36 weeks GA. Aim 3) Determine if fetal neurodevelopmental scores predict infant neurodevelopment. Hypothesis: DHA insufficiency associated with lower fetal HRV and fABAS scores will have a programming effect evidenced by 1) lower band-limited EEG power at 1 month of age to infrequent auditory stimuli, 2) decreased habituation to familiar visual stimuli at 6 and 12 months, evidenced by a larger ERP negative central (NC) component and 3) reduced maintenance of sustained attention and longer overall ocular latency between 4-6 months. Relevance to Public Health: Currently, there are no FDA recommendations for DHA supplementation during pregnancy. If the aims of this proposal are achieved, it could lead to informed recommendations with respect to the appropriate use and effective dose of supplemental DHA and dietary recommendations during pregnancy, especially in populations where the nutritional status of the diet is suboptimal."
"9637747","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a clinician trained in China, I have a long stand interests in biomedical sciences, particularly basic and translational biology, which are stemmed from my personal experiences. First, my mother is a survival of renal carcinoma and my cousin's wife died from pancreatic cancer. Second, I had seen anxiety, sense of loss, frustration, and grief from patients or family when accompanying my mother to the hospital for treatment of her Postphlebitic syndrome and during my clinical training in hospitals in China. Third, I remembered despairingly that whatever we do, we're never going to be able to help families like that in the caring of terminally ill patients in my clinical curriculum. After receiing extensive training in basic biology, both in Dr. Pier Paolo Pandolfi's lab and Dr. Ronald DePinho's lab, I strongly believe that we should not only have a better understanding the basic biology underlying cancer biology, but also make an endeavor to bridge the gap between the basic research and clinical medicine using the translational approach. The proposed study is to explore novel therapeutic opportunities to cure prostate cancer, including castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by explore the tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanism underlying prostate tumor progression and castration resistance. Particularly, I will focus on biology of MDSCs and the tumor- MDSCs crosstalk. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common noncutaneous malignancy in men in the United States and the mainstay therapy for PCa is androgen deprivation therapy, which ultimately failed and results in the development of CRPC. My unpublished results shows that mouse prostate tumors deficient for Pten and Smad4 not only became resistant to surgical castration and a comprehensive AR signaling blockage using surgical castration plus Enzalutamide, a recently approved AR inhibitor for metastatic CRPC. In addition, MDSCs are the predominant sub-population in the intratumoral infiltrated immune cells and anti-Gr1 neutralizing antibody MDSCs depletion in our mouse model lead to a dramatic regression of tumors. Thus I propose to study the role of MDSCs in prostate tumor progression and castration resistance in our mouse model. With Aim1, I will characterize the MDSCs during tumor progression and in the response to ADT. I will also test whether MDSCs are necessary and sufficient for tumor progression by using pharmacological inhibition and genetic depletion of MDSCs. Moreover, I will test whether MDSCs depletion in combination with ADT provides a prolonged therapeutic benefit. In Aim 2, I will perform molecular profiling and bioinformatic analysis to shed light on the mechanistic insight on the MDSCs-tumor crosstalk. Thus I will explore the possibility to target the MDSCs-tumor crosstalk in order to treat prostate caner and castration resistance. So in Aim 3, I will first perform functional validations of the candidate genes identified from Aim 2 using gain-of- function and loss-of-function approaches in multiple assays. Furthermore, I will validate the genes identified from our mouse model in human prostate cancer samples for their potential used as biomarkers as well as potential therapeutic targets. The information obtained from this aim will help us This proposed study would help me to form a strong research program, with which I will launch an independent faculty position in an academic/medical research institution. To that end, my immediate goals are to continue sharpening my technical skills in mouse genetics, cancer immunology, tumor microenvironment and expanding my skills in cancer immunotherapy, oncogenomics, biostatistics and translational biology. In terms of my career development, I will devote to improve my skills on managing lab, mentoring postdocs and students, scientific writing and presentation, and seeking for collaborations, among others, because these skills are all essential for me to land a faculty position and succeed as a PI. MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and the Ronald DePinho laboratory provide an excellent training environment for me to achieve these goals. Even though Dr. DePinho is President of MDACC now, he still promises to devote 2.5% effort to my training and career development. I have also formed an extraordinary advisory committee composed of Dr. Mien-Chie Huang, and Dr. Giulio Draetta. They will not only provide me technical support for my proposed study, but also guide me to look for a faculty position and succeed as an independent investigator. With the help of K99/R00 training grant, I will have a good start to achieve my long term goals, which are to continue exploring basic and translational problems in cancer biology, including prostate cancer progression and castration resistance, as a lab head in an academic/medical research institute and to contribute to developing novel cancer therapies as a team player by collaborating with other scientists, physicians and pharmaceutical companies."
"9447102","Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become a major emerging cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients since the epidemics of hypervirulent and antibiotic-resistant strains began in the early 2000s. It is therefore important to develop new preventions/treatments to counteract the rapid increase in the incidence of CDI. While standard treatments with antibiotics are not effective resulting in high rates of relapse, animal and clinical studies have unambiguously demonstrated that antitoxin antibodies are protective against both primary and recurrent CDI. Our goal is to develop novel immunoprophylaxes against both primary and recurrent CDI in aged high-risk populations. In this proposal we aim to exploit two novel compounds (ABBA and cTxAB) developed in this lab: 1) ABBA is a single tetra-specific binding agent consisting of four distinct neutralizing VHH monomers (two against TcdA and two against TcdB); and 2) cTxAB is an atoxic, clostridial toxin-like chimeric vaccine for which a product development plan (PDP) toward clinical trials is currently being developed under NIH funding. We have already demonstrated potent efficacy of ABBA against fulminant CDI in mice. We will further optimize and finalize its delivery strategies in this project. To reduce potential immunogenicity and increase the serum half-life of ABBA for systemic administration, we will generate ABBA-Fc fusions and humanized ABBA-lgGIs without compromising its superior affinity to toxins and neutralizing activity. In addition, we will develop a colonic delivery system for intestinal delivery of ABBA. The lead compounds generated for systemic and oral deliveries will be evaluated in a hamster fulminant CDI model as well as in gnotobiotic piglets colonized with human intestinal flora. Moreover, we will combine the passive ABBA immunization with active cTxAB vaccination and evaluate protection against both primary and recurrent CDI in relevant immunosenescent mouse models. Our ultimate goal is to develop novel immunoprophylaxes and combinations of active and passive immunizations that we wish to prevent against both immediate and longer term CDI threats in aged patients with high risk of developing this debilitating disease. This project will help to achieve the broad objective ofthe entire CETR proposal and to address the hypothesis that we can translate promising immunoprophylactic candidate products being tested in relevant immunosenescent animal models into immune preventions against important enteric pathogens for which the ultimate human targets are elderly subjects."

"9459396","Project Summary This research project will test the hypothesis that, in the diabetic milieu, S100A9 induces the calcification potential of macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (EV), precursors of microcalcifications, contributing to the biomechanical instability of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. S100A9, a recently identified biomarker of vulnerable plaques, increases in the blood of patients with type 1 diabetes, is expressed by macrophages, and is a component of EV. Our published studies linked macrophages and calcification, and showed that macrophages can release EV with a high calcification potential. The present study will explore further the role of proinflammatory macrophages in vascular calcification in diabetes. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis in vitro that diabetic milieu promotes macrophage activation and accelerates release and mineralization of S100A9?enriched EV. These experiments will involve innovative methods for detection of EV microcalcifications and macrophage phenotypes, including density dependent scanning electron microscopy (DDSEM) combined with elemental analysis, high-resolution microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, 3D-hydrogel system, proteomics, single cell RNA sequencing, and network analyses. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis in vivo that S100A9 mediates diabetes-induced microcalcifications in atherosclerotic plaques. We expect that i) genetic deletion of S100A9, ii) macrophage-targeted siRNA silencing of S100A9, and iii) bone marrow transplantation from S100A9-deficient mice will retard the progression of microcalcification and subsequent rupture, as determined by molecular imaging and comprehensive histopathological analyses. Specific Aim 3 will quantitatively evaluate the impact of microcalcification on the biomechanical instability of the atherosclerotic plaque, using mathematical modeling and finite element analysis. These complementary studies will advance the field by identifying the role of macrophage S100A9 in microcalcification. To facilitate clinical translation of mouse data, we will employ human primary macrophages and atherosclerotic plaque specimens from patients with diabetes. The findings from this project will help to develop much needed anti-calcification therapies."

"9517189","Abstract Speech carries rich linguistic information over a large range of temporal scales: the average durations of phonemes, syllables, words and sentences range from tens of milliseconds to multiple seconds, respectively. Thus, to achieve successful speech perception, the acoustic speech signal needs to be analyzed over appropriate temporal scales to interface with their respective linguistic representations. Where and how this acousto-linguistic mapping of temporal speech properties occurs is still not fully explained in current speech/language models. Here, we show how cortical processing of acoustic temporal structure in speech is modulated by higher-level linguistic analysis. This requires two essential features: (1) control over the temporal scale at which analysis occurs; (2) control over the linguistic content of the information. For (1), we use a novel sound-quilting algorithm that controls the temporal structure in speech at different temporal scales by shuffling and then stitching together speech segments of a certain length; this approach yields new ?speech quilt? signals that preserve the natural temporal structure in the original source signal only up to the set segment length, but not beyond. The segment lengths (30, 120, 480, and 960 ms) are chosen to span the typical temporal range of phonemes, syllables, and words. For (2), we manipulate speech familiarity by using recordings of bi-lingual speakers, reading from a book in English and Korean, as the source signal to create speech quilts in two languages. This approach ensures that any changes at the signal acoustics level affect both languages identically, while manipulating the linguistic percept differently. Thus, neural responses that vary as a function of segment length but are shared or similar across the two languages will suggest analysis at the signal-acoustics level, whereas neural responses that differ based on language familiarity will imply the presence of linguistic processes. In Aim 1, we argue (using fMRI) that temporal acoustic structure in speech is extracted in superior temporal sulcus (STS) for both languages; linguistic processes, originating in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), become engaged in a familiar language only and in turn modulate such signal-acoustics level analyses in anterior and posterior STS. In Aim 2, we capitalize on the high temporal resolution of EEG to suggest that one potential neural mechanism for the results in Aim 1 is that neurons are able to phase-lock more to the speech quilt signal as its natural temporal structure increases (longer segment lengths), which in turn is again modulated and enhanced by speech familiarity. The results will have a significant impact on speech/language models that need to account for where and how specific temporal scales in speech interface with their linguistic representations, while also informing approaches towards clinical populations such as children struggling to decode critical temporal speech units, as in dyslexia or auditory processing disorder (APD). !"
"9660106","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Failure of neural tube closure is a devastating birth defect. Research in the Niswander lab has provided significant insights into the molecular and cellular regulation of NT closure. We have created and studied mouse models with neural tube defects (NTDs) to elucidate the molecular foundations of NT closure. Moreover, we have created robust and novel technology to visualize NT closure in a living mammalian embryo. Our dynamic imaging and key genetic mutants have focused attention on the little studied but critical role for the non-neural ectoderm (NNE) in NT closure. In addition we developed methods to specifically isolate NNE cells to provide a refined and robust platform to study the biology of the NNE.  Here we will build upon our unique perspective and turn our attention to spinal NTDs, to provide insight into the most common type of NTD in humans, and to two genetic pathways that are associated with spina bifida in mice and humans. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the two closely related Grainyhead-like (GRHL) transcription factors, GRHL2 and GRHL3, differentially control cranial and spinal NT closure through unique and differential activation of target genes, in part mediated by interaction with the JNK signaling pathway that activates the AP1 (cJUN/cFOS) transcription factor. Aim 2 will extend our live platform to test the hypothesis that GRHL-regulated NNE transcriptional programs drive NT closure by controlling cell adhesion, recycling of membrane components, cell shape changes, and/or actin dynamics. Aim 3 will combine our comprehensive molecular and cellular insights with novel unpublished analyses of hundreds of NTD samples to test the hypothesis that mutations identified in GRHL3 and the JNK pathway are causative for spinal NTDs in humans. Relevance of research to public health: The proposed experiments will lead to new cellular and molecular insights into the causes of caudal NTDs, the most common type of NTD and which leads to a profoundly important and frequently disrupted aspect of mammalian embryogenesis. Moreover, our studies will impart novel insights into the general mechanisms of embryonic tissue fusion including the face and body wall. The insights gained here may lead to therapies of general application for treatment of embryonic tissue closure defects that together represent a significant percentage of human birth defects.

"9437846","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myocardial hypertrophy occurs in response to multiple stressors such as hypertension or aortic stenosis. This phenomenon is initially adaptive, but frequently evolves into heart failure. Prevention of heart failure and promotion of functional compensation represent important clinical goals. However, the molecular mechanisms affecting cardiac compensation during hypertrophy remain elusive. Recent studies have found that the post- translational modification of serine/threonine residues by O-linked ß-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) increases during hypertrophy and heart failure; a process termed O-GlcNAcylation. However, several obstacles have hindered our understanding of O-GlcNAc signaling during cardiac hypertrophy. Generation of the O-GlcNAc moiety depends on shuttling glucose into an accessary pathway from glycolysis, which raises the possibility that the metabolic shifts during hypertrophy regulate O-GlcNAc signaling. However, the metabolic pathway that generates the O-GlcNAc moiety is very poorly understood and there is little data about synthesis of the O-GlcNAc moiety in the intact heart, let alone during the metabolic shifts present during hypertrophy. We also have an incomplete understanding of the basic functional effects of O-GlcNAc modifications of proteins during cardiac hypertrophy. Experimental models of heart disease demonstrate both adaptive and detrimental outcomes by elevating global O-GlcNAc levels. Technical limitations in identifying and quantifying specific O-GlcNAc protein modification sites, termed here the O-GlcNAcome, have limited our understanding of the mechanisms regulating O-GlcNAc's functional effects in the heart. However, the O- GlcNAcome has been described by our collaborators in other organs. Using GCMS, LCMS and HPLC, we will test our central working hypothesis that changes in substrate metabolism during hypertrophy affect functional compensation through O-GlcNAc signaling. Thus, the aims of this proposal are to: a) test the hypothesis that metabolic perturbations during hypertrophy regulate cardiac function by modifying global O-GlcNAcylation; b) test the hypothesis that global O-GlcNAcylation promotes successful adaptation to early pressure overload, but that prolonged global O-GlcNAcylation contributes to late cardiac dysfunction; and c) test the hypothesis that the observed and sometimes paradoxical differences in functional outcomes from global O-GlcNAcylation are due to specificity within the O-GlcNAcome. This project specifically addresses key deficits in our current knowledge of O-GlcNAc's regulation, functional effects and specifically modified proteins during cardiac hypertrophy. The resulting information will allow us to rationally develop strategies for therapeutically modulating O-GlcNAcylation."
"9541625","Project Summary ? Core B  Ex-vivo 3-D ?mini-intestine? culture systems, termed enteroids, generated from human surgical  specimens or endoscopic biopsies, have been found to recapitulate the multiple cell types that  comprise the crypt-villus axis of the normal intestinal epithelium. The development of these  enteroids has provided an exciting opportunity to advance our understanding of how pathogenic  as well as beneficial microorganisms, many of which can prevent or lessen the severity of  pathogen-induced diarrheal illness, interact with and induce responses from the intestinal  epithelium. Therefore, the long range objectives of the Human Enteroid Core are to (1)  characterize and compare human enteroids generated from three regions of the small intestine  (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and colon, from different patients to establish their use as models  of human diarrheal diseases, (2) test new approaches to improve the enteroids as a relevant  model of normal intestinal epithelium, and (3) to provide these enteroids and specialized growth  reagents for use in the other projects (Core C, Projects 1, 2, and 3) proposed in this application.  The goal of the Human Enteroid Core is to provide a centralized facility to meet the enteroid  needs of all of the investigators involved in the NAMSED proposal. The specific functions of the  Core will have two functions: a Service component, which will (1) Produce enteroid cultures  from our existing bank for all projects (2) Establish enteroids from select new patient samples  (3) Maintain frozen stocks of all enteroids (4) Passage and differentiate enteroids per requests  (5) Maintain WNT, noggin, and r-spondin producing cells lines and standardized conditioned  media for enteroid culture (6) Routinely test the enteroid lines for differentiation status (7)  Technology transfer through training group members; a Development component, which will (1)  Develop and standardize physiological measures as indicators of enteroid responses (2) Modify  enteroids to enhance or deplete the presence of specific cell types or genes (3) Co-culture with  mesenchymal cells to test for substitution of growth factors and develop novel structural  components (e.g., inversion of the enteroids such that the apical surface faces outward) (4)  Incorporate immune cells to improve the relevance of the enteroid model. The Core will be  responsive to needs of the individual Projects, which may change as the research projects  proceed, as the overall field evolves and as new platforms are engineered in Project 3. New  activities will be developed to meet the needs of our and other NASMED project investigators.  Our goal is complementary and collaborative in these exciting efforts to develop the enteroids  as models to study enteric disease."
"9471822","Reconstructive surgery is advocated for most children with hypospadias to prevent potentially serious cosmetic and functional problems. Parents faced with a decision about hypospadias repair encounter an irreversible choice with potentially lifelong consequences. Recent studies have identified decisional conflict (DC) and decisional regret (DR) as a significant problem for parents. Several recent guidelines on complex urologic topics suggest that shared decision-making (SDM) is the optimal approach. Therefore, I propose to improve SDM and the care of hypospadias patients by developing an evidence-based decision aid (DA). My hypothesis is that a DA developed for use with parents of hypospadias patients will facilitate the SDM process thereby decreasing DC and DR. Furthermore, studies assessing DR suggest that family variables, rather than surgical variables, are most strongly associated with DR after hypospadias surgery. As such, it is imperative that we shift our assessment from surgeon- to patient-centered outcomes to improve patient/parent satisfaction. Therefore, I also propose to identify patient-centered outcome measures, which emphasize what is important to patients with hypospadias as they mature and their parents. This study aims to (1) Utilize patient-centered design research methods to explore the parental decision making-process regarding hypospadias repair and outcomes of importance to parents; (2) Assess qualitatively providers' attitudes about SDM and use of a DA for hypospadias; (3) Create a DA and postoperative outcome measurement tool for use by parents; and (4) Conduct a pilot test of the DA in the clinical setting and a psychometric assessment of the patient-centered postoperative outcomes measurement tool. My long-term career/research goal is to become an independent investigator with the skills to help parents make more informed decisions about hypospadias surgery and objectively measure its long-term outcomes from a patient/parental perspective. Additionally I plan to apply this methodology to other urologic genital procedures. I hope to develop a fuller understanding of how we can effectively provide parents with optimal decision support and assess our postoperative outcomes using a parent-centered approach. My career development aims addressed in this proposal include (a) Developing proficiency in qualitative research, including patient-centered design research methods, (b) Improving delivery of pediatric urology services through the development and use of decision support tools and patient/parent- centered outcomes research, and (c) Understanding the ethical implications of SDM research. I will complete this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron Carroll and a multidisciplinary team with expertise in health decision sciences, pediatric urology and qualitative research. Future plans include a multi-site randomized controlled trial of the effects of DA on hypospadias decision-making and a psychometric assessment of the OMT in a larger sample prior to its implementation in longitudinal studies."
"9636317","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. The causes of NTDs are multifactorial, including genetic, environmental, and nutritional factors. Maternal folic acid (FA) status is one of the strongest links to NTD susceptibility. Numerous studies have shown that supplemental FA can reduce NTD prevalence by as much as 70% in some populations. Despite more than 40 years of intensive effort, we still do not understand the mechanisms that underlie these folate-dependent processes. We have begun to address this existing data gap utilizing a new mouse NTD model (Mthfd1l KO) that closely replicates the human NTD phenotype, and does not require additional nutritional intervention to express the NTD phenotype. In this new mouse model, loss of a specific folate-dependent enzyme (mitochondrial MTHFD1L) leads to NTDs. This is the most specific metabolic defect yet associated with NTD susceptibility/etiology, and suggests that FA provides essential one-carbon units for nucleotide and methyl group biosynthesis. These biosynthetic pathways are especially active in the rapidly growing embryo, where they support cell proliferation and death, migration, and differentiation during neural tube closure (NTC). We will test the following specific hypotheses using this mouse model: (1) Maternal supplementation with methionine, purines, thymidylate and S-adenosylmethionine can protect against NTDs in nullizygous Mthfd1l KO (Mthfd1lz/z) embryos, (2) Depakote (Valproic Acid; VPA), the leading cause of pharmaceutical-induced NTDs, inhibits mitochondrial 1C metabolism, thus it is possible that formate can prevent NTDs caused by this teratogen, and (3) cell proliferation and apoptosis, cell migration, and differentiation programs are disrupted in Mthfd1lz/z embryos, leading to neural tube and orofacial defects. We demonstrated that maternal supplementation of MTHFD1L dams with formate, the product of the MTHFD1L enzymatic reaction, decreases the incidence of NTDs and partially rescues the growth deficit in embryos lacking a functional Mthfd1l. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine which supplements downstream of the MTHFD1L reaction can rescue the NTD phenotype. This will be explored in a number of FA responsive and non-responsive NTD mutant strains, and in VPA-sensitive mouse strains. We will identify which cellular processes are dysregulated in Mthfd1lz/z embryos and VPA-sensitive mouse strains, leading to improper NTC. Metabolomic and epigenetic studies will be pursued to fully characterize the mutant mice. Specific Aim 2 will focus on the requirement for formate in neural stem cells and neural crest stem cells using neurosphere growth and differentiation assays, as well as additional epigenetic investigations. Specific Aim 3 will involve DNA resequencing of the human MTHFD1L gene and functional analyses of identified variants in a spina bifida cohort. This research program offers hope for developing the first effective intervention for non-FA responsive NTDs by illuminating the underlying mechanisms by which formate prevents NTDs. Developing interventions that benefit non-folate responsive NTDs is crucial for preventing these preventable birth defects."
"9557210","Abstract  HIV+ individuals are several thousand times more likely to be diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma, 70 times more likely to be diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and five times more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer than uninfected people. They are also more likely to be diagnosed with anal, liver, and lung cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. African Americans are disproportionately affected by HIV and cancer. They represent 13% of the population, yet accounted for 43% of HIV cases in 2014. NCI recommends antiretroviral therapy (ART) as a key cancer prevention strategy among HIV+ individuals, yet many HIV+ people, especially African Americans, have difficulty adhering to ART. According to NCI, regular screenings and a healthy lifestyle may also help reduce cancer rates? but only if used consistently.  A growing literature of randomized controlled trials has demonstrated mhealth to be successful for promoting cancer prevention, healthy lifestyle behaviors and medication adherence?including among African Americans. However, no cancer prevention mhealth intervention has yet been developed that targets HIV+ African Americans, despite this group being disproportionately affected by BOTH cancer and HIV.  To address this critical gap, the research team, which includes a health psychologist and experts in oncology, infectious disease, health disparities, and pharmacology, will develop a culturally-sensitive mhealth intervention that includes a patient app and care provider team (CPT) platform to promote cancer prevention behaviors among HIV+ African American adults. This research will be guided by three specific aims: 1) Develop an individually-tailored, culturally-sensitive mhealth intervention, comprised of a patient app and CPT platform to promote cancer prevention behaviors among HIV+ African American adults. 2) Implement 12-week pre-post test design pilot to evaluate short-term effectiveness for promoting cancer prevention behaviors, i.e. self-efficacy for healthy eating, self-efficacy for walking, cancer screening intention, and ART adherence among HIV+ African Americans. 3) Evaluate feasibility. At 12 wks, we will evaluate feasibility via focus groups with all pre-post participants and interviews with CPT members involved in implementation. The primary and secondary hypotheses are that HIV+ African American adults who receive tailored cancer prevention texts plus daily pill reminders for 12 weeks will show 1) greater self-efficacy for healthy eating and greater self-efficacy for walking and 2) greater cancer screening intention and greater ART adherence at 12 weeks compared to baseline.  Long-term, if proven to be effective in a Phase II SBIR application, the proposed research will help to reduce the cancer rates and increase early diagnoses of cancer among African Americans who are HIV positive, while simultaneously improving ART adherence rates."
"9458716","A long-standing challenge in basic and translational neuroscience and in clinical practice is to understand the vast inter-individual differences in vulnerability to substance abuse and addiction. To address this challenge we propose to study the genetic and functional basis of novelty-seeking behavior in two lines of rats that offer a uniquely powerful model for understanding the neural mechanisms of drug seeking, addiction and relapse. We developed these lines by selecting for high and low propensity to explore a mildly stressful novel environment, respectively. After 37 generations, the bred High Responders (bHRs) and bred Low Responders (bLRs) show contrasting spectra of behaviors, which are heritable in both lines. Compared to bLRs and outbred rats, bHRs exhibit higher novelty seeking and impulsive behaviors, lower anxiety, greater propensity to sensitize to psychostimulants, and lower thresholds for drug- and cue-induced relapse, reminiscent of human ?externalizing disorders?. The bLRs are more prone to anxious and depressive behaviors, more responsive to psychosocial stress, which triggers drug-seeking behavior. Thus, the two lines exemplify two extremes of emotional reactivity that map onto human temperamental differences and underlie two paths to drug abuse?novelty seeking and reactivity to psychosocial stress. Our working hypothesis is that functional DNA variants in a limited number of genes, initially derived from outbred Sprague Dawley (SD) founders, account for the current molecular and behavioral divergence of the two lines. Our goal is to identify these causal genes through (1) mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in both an F2 cohort already collected and in SD animals that represent the founders, and (2) further integration of functional genomic data. We propose to apply several sequencing-based technologies and analytical tools under the following specific aims (SAs): SA1: Conduct genome sequencing and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses in a bHR-bLR intercross population (n~636, males and females) using a low-cost Genotype by Sequencing method. SA2: Identify eQTLs, allele-specific expression, and transcripts/pathways associated with the traits by using RNAseq analysis of key neural structures-- the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. As some genes may exert their primary influence during development, we will analyze both young F2 rats (age: 28 days) and adults. SA3: Perform genomewide association study of 1,000 outbred SD rats, followed by integration of all strands of data to identify putatively causal variants and provide initial validation using qPCR, in situ hybridization, and further behavioral tests. We expect to find functional alleles at multiple genes that existed in the SDs and have evolved further apart in the two lines. Many of these genes may be directly relevant to the corresponding human phenotypes or, at a minimum, provide clues to important pathways that could explain or predict the differential vulnerability to addiction and relapse in humans. Our ultimate goal is to gain a deeper mechanistic understanding of addiction, and translate this knowledge to more precise and effective treatment for patients."
"9180506","PROJECT SUMMARY Excessive alcohol consumption has widespread personal and societal consequences, negatively affecting individual health while creating a significant economic and legal burden. Despite increasing efforts over the last few decades to identify genetic influences and neuroadaptations that are associated with the development of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), progress has been limited by the complexity of the underlying neuroanatomy. It is clear that the experimental resolution needs to be improved to the level of identifying adaptations in specific neural circuits that underlie dissociable behaviors related to AUD pathology. Thus, the goal of my research is to identify the neuroadaptations resulting from adolescent binge drinking that perpetuate heavy drinking and cognitive deficits in adulthood. I have focused my research on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as this region continues to develop during adolescence and may be vulnerable to heavy alcohol consumption. For instance, PFC dysfunction is observed in binge drinkers and likely contributes to compulsive alcohol drinking and cognitive deficits observed in AUDs. In mice, I have found that binge drinking during adolescence disrupts performance on a PFC-dependent working memory task, increases alcohol consumption in adulthood, and significantly alters the intrinsic excitability of PFC pyramidal neurons. Discerning the mechanisms underlying these effects requires the use of tools capable of detecting physiological changes in specific neural circuits, as well as the ability to modulate their activity during behavioral analyses. In the mentored phase (K99) of this proposal, I will learn to use viral genetic strategies to visualize PFC projections affected by binge drinking and characterize the circuit-specific changes in excitability following adolescent binge drinking using ex vivo electrophysiology. Further, I will be trained to modulate PFC activity during behavior using chemogenetics, toward the goal of determining the specific role of these prefrontal pathways in binge-drinking and working memory. In the R00 phase, I will utilize a newly developed system for gaining permanent genetic access to neuronal ensembles that are active during defined behaviors (FosTRAP). In combination with the techniques learned in the mentored phase, I will use this technique to identify, characterize and modulate neuronal ensembles engaged in binge-like alcohol consumption. Taken together, the experiments in this proposal were designed to test the overarching hypothesis that adolescent binge drinking differentially affects the intrinsic excitability of medial PFC pyramidal neuron subpopulations and that these subpopulations play separate roles in binge alcohol consumption and working memory. The proposed experiments will integrate my previous training in behavioral pharmacology, immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology with new viral genetic strategies to identify and manipulate neural circuits. This training plan, in combination with guidance provided by my mentors, will greatly improve my ability to answer important research questions regarding the neurobiology of alcoholism while promoting my transition into an independent research scientist."
"9494114","Project Summary/Abstract Within the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) Center for Biomedical Mass Spectrometry (CBMS), the BUSM MS Shared Instrumentation Laboratory (SIL) operates four mass spectrometers that are dedicated to meeting the increasing and complex needs of NIH- funded investigators. We propose to replace the 12-year-old LTQ-Orbitrap system in the BUSM SIL with a Thermo-Fisher Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Quadrupole Dual Cell Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer System, to significantly enhance performance and provide additional, critically important operating modes, to dramatically improve sensitivity and dynamic range and to gain the capability for obtaining very high resolution multimode/multistage data, and to increase system reliability. The system will deliver MS and multistage tandem MS measurements with narrow precursor ion selection width and high mass accuracy over a wide dynamic range. The Fusion Lumos will enable identifications and quantifications that are too challenging for presently available systems, and will generate novel fragments to facilitate structure elucidation of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates and detailed definition of post- translationally modified proteins and their interacting partners, to accelerate progress in ongoing projects related to human health. The requested system will improve the results that can be obtained by the BUSM SIL because structures will be able to be assigned to the biologically important compounds present in otherwise unresolved, unknown peaks; faster scan times and higher sensitivity will enable the identification of more components in complex mixtures and improve the reliability of the identifications; multistage dissociation modes will make available important and novel sequential fragmentation pathways to better define even fragile molecular structures, and the efficient transfer of high mass ions into the orbitrap will facilitate the study of large intact proteins and glycoproteins (e.g., antibodies), as well as covalent and noncovalent complexes. The research topics include cardiovascular and metabolic disease, diabetes, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer disease, prion diseases, cancer, rheumatoid and Lyme arthritis, HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, RNA binding proteins, and muscle regulation. Research projects of nineteen Major and seven Minor Users are described. Protocols that take strategic advantage of the advanced capabilities of the proposed system will be developed. Most investigators are located on the BUSM campus; the two external Users (both at HMS/MGH) collaborate with CBMS investigators."
"9537980","ABSTRACT Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation results in injury to multiple organs causing acute radiation syndrome. Bone marrow transplant (BMT) is an effective strategy to replace and regenerate injured stem cells, it has proven to be very successful in mitigating radiation induced acute injury to the bone marrow (BM- ARS). However at higher radiation doses and for non-hematopoietic injuries, BM mitigation alone is not sufficient to rescue from mortality. For instance, acute radiation injury to the gastro-intestinal tract (GI-ARS) is not mitigated by BMT or cytokine therapies. We have shown that GI-ARS can be successfully mitigated by bone marrow adherent stromal cell transplant (BMASCT), consisting mainly of stromal and myeloid cells. BMASCT in its current form is limiting when a large population is at risk, HLA libraries and well as allogeneic cell transplant therapies are essential to developing this therapy for a large population. Current application proposes various strategies to develop a radiomitigating cell product that can be used in a mass casualty scenario."
"9394028","Abstract: Intrauterine inflammation (IUI) is a major contributor to preterm labor and fetal inflammation leading to injury responses in fetal organs such as the brain, lung and the GI tract. Although inflammation is known to be the proximate cause of preterm labor and fetal complications in IUI, no anti-inflammatory therapies are currently available, partly because the mechanism/s of inflammation are not well understood. New therapeutic targets are urgently needed to stem the tide and costly sequelae of IUI and preterm labor. We investigated these mechanisms in a preterm gestation Rhesus macaque model of IUI induced by intra-amniotic injection of LPS, and by using tissues from women delivering preterm infants. Our key findings supporting this application are: (i) Neutrophils infiltrating the chorio-decidua during IUI are activated with prolonged survival and a contributor to the inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface; (ii) The anti-apoptosis mediator, Bfl1 (also known as Bcl-2A1 in mice), is up-regulated specifically in the chorio-decidua neutrophils during IUI; (iii) Bfl1 increases survival of activated neutrophils. In this multi-PI application, we will test the hypothesis that Bfl1 promotes neutrophil survival and exacerbates inflammatory responses in the chorio-decidua. Our approach is to develop a high-affinity Bfl1 inhibitor as a potential novel therapy for IUI. A compelling rationale for focusing on Bfl1 is that it's up-regulation is specific to activated hematopoietic cells and these activated cells are uniquely susceptible to Bfl1 inhibition. This property of Bfl1 overcomes a major hurdle in anti-inflammatory therapy of undesired deleterious effects on basal immune function. Our study will build on proof-of-concept pre-clinical studies from other labs demonstrating efficacy of anti-Bfl1 directed therapies targeting activated basophil- mediated anaphylaxis or triggering apoptosis in resistant cancer cells. In Aim 1, we will exploit our expertise in drug-design by using in silico, biochemical, and crystallographic approaches to find compounds with high affinity for Bfl1 but not other Bcl-2 members. After screening primary compounds for efficacy in mouse cells, a key feature in our approach is the use of counter-screening secondary assays. Here, we will screen the lead compounds for lack of biologic effects in mouse cells devoid of Bax/Bak, the downstream executioners of the Bcl-2A1 (Bfl1) regulated apoptotic pathway. This will minimize any pro-apoptotic compounds with off-target effects. In Aim 2, the efficacy of the lead compounds will be tested in activated chorio-decidua cells from women with histologic chorioamnionitis, and the efficacy will be compared against siRNA-mediated blockade. Completion of these studies will provide novel clinical candidate compounds that can be tested in pre-clinical in vivo studies using mouse and non-human primate models that our group already has. A distinctive feature of our application is the collaborative multi-disciplinary team with expertise in clinical-translational perinatal inflammation, Bcl-2 immunology, medicinal chemistry, and rational drug-design. !"
"9528158","Abstract Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a rare but deadly bone tumor which occurs mainly in adolescents and young adults.1 As survival for ES has not improved beyond ~60% in the last few decades, it is critical to enable the prediction and early detection of disease through the discovery of genetic contributions to risk. While the literature on the causes of ES is sparse, several lines of evidence have emerged which collectively suggest that de novo germline mutations (DNM's) underlie a proportion of cases. These include a lack of environmental risk factors or syndromes associated with ES and a strong increasing risk with rising parental age. Given the strong rationale for examining DNMs in ES, we propose the following specific aims using WGS data of germline from 331 case-parent trios: 1) to identify germline DNMs in ES patient genomes; 2) to identify regions with recurrent DNMs in ES patient genomes; and 3) to compare the burden of pathogenic variation from DNMs or otherwise in an extended set of 457 ES patients with WGS data to controls. The analysis will be the definitive examination of DNMs in ES. Results indicating DNMs are a frequent cause of ES could lead to clinical guidelines urging sequencing of all patients, who currently receive little genetic testing due to lack of family history. Lastly the results could potentially point to opportunities for early detection and possibly therapeutic targets."
"9543160","This proposal seeks to develop a novel class of ruthenium (Ru) compounds that can be activated with light to eliminate primary tumors, inhibit disseminated disease, and prevent recurrence. It is hypothesized that light- responsive prodrugs with these capabilities will be of use in the development of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treating melanoma. PDT is an underutilized, niche cancer treatment modality that combines light and a photosensitizer (PS) to create cytotoxic singlet oxygen for destroying tumors and tumor vasculature. Although commonly thought of as a local treatment, PDT has been known to stimulate anti-tumor immunity, which is crucial for controlling metastatic disease and subsequent tumor regrowth. PDT relies heavily on the presence of oxygen to exert its antitumor effects, and the PSs approved for PDT are generally organic compounds that are activated with red light. In order for PDT to be maximally effective toward melanoma, it would be advantageous to develop PSs that can function well in hypoxic tissue with wavelengths of light that are least attenuated by the melanin in pigmented melanomas (650-850 nm). If such agents could be incorporated into regimens that stimulate antitumor immunity, PDT might offer new treatment options for highly recurrent cancers such as melanoma, where chemotherapy and radiotherapy do not work. We previously developed very potent metal-based PSs that combine Ru and ?-expansive ligands to yield systems that create cytotoxic reactive oxygen species even at low oxygen tension due to their long excited state lifetimes and large bimolecular quenching rates. Separately, we developed osmium (Os)-based PSs that absorb light at wavelengths longer than 800 nm and can generate a modest PDT effect with this low-energy light even in hypoxic tissue. This proposal will combine the best features of the Ru (potency) and Os (activation >800 nm) PSs to yield new Ru metal complexes that are designed to elicit a strong PDT effect with near-infrared light in hypoxic tissue using increasingly more sophisticated melanoma models. Coordination chemistry will be used to generate a library of modular 3D compounds that can be subsequently modified to produce structurally diverse families. The photophysical and photochemical properties of these new compounds will be fully explored, and they will be assessed for their diagnostic potential and PDT effects using 2D cell and 3D tumor spheroid melanoma models. Promising candidates will be selected for MTD determination and PDT studies in two mouse melanoma models. PSs that are PDT-active and nontoxic to mice will be probed for their abilities to induce antitumor immunity through tumor rechallenge experiments. Finally, the immunological aspects of favorable PDT responses in mice will be investigated using both in vitro and in vivo techniques, and the PDT regimen will be explored and optimized for maximizing both local tumor control and stimulating antitumor immunity. This project will introduce novel PSs for melanoma PDT and will expand fundamental knowledge of metal complex chemistry, photophysics, and therapeutic properties."
"9516680","Project Summary/Abstract:  The intricate tissue architecture established during organ of Corti development requires precise temporal coordination between arrest of cell proliferation and initiation of sensory cell differentiation. Despite the necessity for this complex patterning, the mechanism regulating cell-cycle exit in the developing organ of Corti remains poorly understood.  This proposal is aimed at investigating the role of Hippo signaling?a pathway that has recently emerged as an important regulator of growth control?in organ of Corti morphogenesis. Unlike most signaling cascades, Hippo is repressive in nature, and it is activated mechanically through increased cell density, cell- cell contacts, and tissue stiffness. The main experimental objective of the current proposal is to investigate whether genetic manipulation of the transcription co-factor Yap?a downstream target of Hippo?regulates cell proliferation and cell-cycle exit in the developing inner ear. To interrogate this premise, Cre-loxP mediated gene knockout will be implemented for loss of function experiments (Aim 1), and viral expression of a constitutively active form of Yap will be used to assess gain-of-function conditions (Aim 3). Additionally, a novel three-dimensional cochlear organ culture will be used to study the role of mechanical force of Yap protein degradation and cell-cycle exit in the developing organ of Corti.  The proposed basic research has a long-term therapeutic potential. Understanding the role of Yap in triggering the arrest of prosensory-cell proliferation during early stages of organ of Corti development is critical in efforts to characterize the molecular signaling network governing its morphogenesis. A more complete understanding of organ of Corti development will aid in relieving the restriction on proliferative response in the surviving populations of inner ear supporting cells, which is the major impediment to hair-cell regeneration in mammals."
"9469859","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of my proposed work is to use genomics and three-dimensional (3D) spatial data from imaging to study spatial patterns of tumor heterogeneity in vivo. Most tumors are not comprised of identical copies of one cell, but instead a mixture of cells with different genetic alterations. The co-existence of these genetically distinct populations is thought to underlie treatment failure. Previous intratumoral heterogeneity studies have been limited by insufficient sampling, typically just one biopsy per tumor, and a lack of knowledge of where within the heterogeneous tumor the sample was obtained. This is a particularly important and challenging issue to address in glioma, the most common form of brain tumor. While a handful of studies have used multi-region sampling to characterize glioma heterogeneity within subtypes, these studies have not determined how spatial patterns of heterogeneity differ among subtypes, nor how these divergent patterns impact therapeutically relevant characteristics, such as the tumor microenvironment. Previous work and my preliminary data suggest that relatively indolent low-grade glioma (LGG) has distinct spatial patterns of heterogeneity from more aggressive high-grade glioma (HGG). To evaluate this, I propose to use 8-10 spatially-distinct biopsies from each tumor (LGG or HGG), each removed using a surgical navigation system that records the precise, 3D location of each of biopsy. With this unique data set, I will determine how 3D patterns of genetic heterogeneity differ between LGG and HGG, as well as evaluate the consequences of divergent 3D heterogeneity patterns on the tumor microenvironment. The knowledge gained from this work will allow for the development of more informed, tumor subtype-specific biopsy strategies. It will also reveal therapeutically-relevant relationships between patterns of genetic heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment, knowledge of which has the potential to serve as a foundation for the development of more effective treatments for brain tumors."

"9428000","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The worldwide epidemic of ischemic heart diseases urgently requires innovative treatments in spite of the significant advances in medical, interventional and surgical therapy for these diseases. A microvesicle (MV)-based therapeutic angiogenesis is emerging for ischemic diseases because of tumorigenic concern of the stem cell approach. MVs are submicron particles that are released from cells, and contain a package of protein, mRNA, microRNA and bioactive lipid. In addition, MV has recently been recognized as a signaling transferring vehicle in intercellular communication. In our current pilot funding period, we have demonstrated that MVs from adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), particularly from endothelial differentiation medium (EDM)-preconditioned ASCs, promote angiogenesis in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo (matrigel plugs). An underlying mechanism of the proangiogenesis may be the delivery of microRNA-31 via MVs from ASCs to vascular endothelial cells in which FIH1 (factor inhibiting HIF-1) is targeted and suppressed. In this application, our central hypothesis i that the transplantation of ASC-derived MVs promotes angiogenesis in ischemic heart myocardial infarction. We will complement this approach with broader efforts to continue to feed our pipeline of hypothesis-driven mechanistic experiments. Aim 1 is to determine the role of MVs released from EDM-preconditioned ASCs in promoting angiogenesis in the ischemic heart. The MVs will be administered after myocardial infarction (MI) in severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD SCID) mice. The cardiac function, cell proliferation and apoptosis, ?brotic area, and capillary density will subsequently be evaluated. Aim 2 is to investigate the role of miR-31 signaling in intercellular communication through the MVs. We will explore the activity of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which has been reported to be inhibited by FIH1, and will broaden our understanding of the role of miR-31/FIH1/HIF-1 pathway in MV-transplanted ischemic myocardium. Aim 3 is to determine the effect of miR-31 in ASC-derived MVs on cardiac repair after MI. The effects of different dosing, timing and delivery routes of administration of MVs on cardiac repair after MI will be investigated. To increase the throughput of our investigation, miR-31 will be manipulated in EDM-preconditioned MV-donor ASCs or in MVs directly. At the conclusion of this research proposal we will have characterized the role of miR-31/FIH1/HIF1 pathway in MV- based therapy for ischemic heart diseases. Modulation of miRNA composition in vascular endothelial cells by delivering angiogenic miRNAs via MV may be an innovative strategy for the treatment of ischemic heart diseases."
"9446966","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of the proposed project is to improve the prognosis of patients with myocardial ischemia caused by coronary artery disease (CAD) or coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD). Early diagnosis of myocardial ischemia caused by CAD is important as both coronary revascularization and medical therapies can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. CMD is a major cause for myocardial ischemia in the absence of obstructive CAD, particularly in women, due to abnormalities in coronary microcirculation. First- pass myocardial perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a highly promising technique for detecting regional blood flow deficits caused by ischemia. It does not require ionizing radiation and provides higher spatial resolution than nuclear imaging. Dynamic images acquired during intravenous vasodilator stress delineate regions associated with myocardial ischemia. Despite considerable technical improvements and clinical experience, a recent multicenter multivendor study (MR-IMPACT II) shows that while the sensitivity of CMR to detect ischemia caused by CAD is superior to SPECT (67% vs 59%), specificity is inferior (61% vs 72%). Both sensitivity and specificity of CMR remain relatively low indicating substantial false positive and false negative diagnoses. Several studies using MBF CMR have shown that abnormal MBF can be used to detect ischemia caused by CMD. However, these studies have shown only moderate diagnostic accuracy, indicating the need for major improvements. Major technical limitations of MBF CMR that contribute to inaccurate diagnoses of CAD and CMD include: (i) image artifacts, such as dark rim artifact (DRA) and cardiac and respiratory motion-induced artifacts, which reduce the image quality and diagnostic accuracy; (ii) incomplete coverage of the LV for evaluating total ischemic burden; (iii) inadequate spatial resolution for reliable detection of subendocardial perfusion deficits; and (iv) errors in AIF estimation for flow quantification due to saturation of blood signal intensity at pea enhancement. In the proposed project, we will develop novel techniques to address these limitations (Aim 1). The techniques will be rigorously validated in animals using microsphere measurements as the reference (Aim 2). Finally, the techniques will be tested in CAD and CMD patients using PET and invasive coronary reactivity testing as reference, respectively (Aim 3). The end point of the project is the development and rigorous validation of a new myocardial perfusion quantification CMR method with whole-heart coverage, high isotropic resolution, cardiac phase-resolved acquisition, accurate arterial input estimation while without the requirements of ECG triggering or breath-hold. It is expected that such a technique will significantly improve image quality, reduce technical failures, increase the diagnostic accuracy, and facilitate the eventual adoption of myocardial perfusion CMR as the method of choice for detecting myocardial ischemia. ."

Specific Aims of this proposal are: 1) Develop and deliver a multidisciplinary Biomedical Devices Development Course including a Clinical Immersion Component and 2) Enhancing Team-based Interdisciplinary Senior Design Project Experience in Biomedical Engineering Education. Innovative components of Specific Aim 1 of this proposal includes shifting from tradition of posing design problems for students to offering biomedical engineering students the opportunity, training and responsibility to identify real-world unmet clinical needs while working in a truly multidisciplinary team of students from the Schools of Nursing through a Biomedical Device Development Course. This course will offer lectures and trainings on responsible conduct of research, intellectual property and patenting, FDA and regulatory path and market analysis. Additional guest lectures from experts in the field will offer insight into the real world product development process. These lectures will be complemented with three industrial site visits to gain an understanding of work environment complexity. Clinical unmet needs will be identified at the five clinical immersion sites followed by two weeks of simulation lab training at the Center for Simulation and Computerized Testing located in Widener School of Nursing offering students hands-on experience of the clinical problem. Student success will be assessed through course assignments, an online discussion forum updating their weekly observation concluding with an oral poster presentation outlining an unmet clinical need and viable engineering solution for each clinical site. The top five proposed project ideas that are appropriate to meet time, cost and prototyping constraints of current design facilities and also ensure full buy-in from the clinician in order to provide direction and technical expertise will then be undertaken by some or all of these BME students as the two semester Capstone senior design project courses (ENGR 401/402), leading us into Specific Aim 2 of this proposed study. Additionally, engineering and nursing (Junior) students could pursue the proposed projects as part of the Widener Summer Research program, which is designed to promote undergraduate research experience at Widener University. Goals of Specific Aim 2 of this proposal are to (a) translate the unmet clinical needs into open-ended, interdisciplinary team- based senior design projects, and broaden students exposure and understanding of challenges that are specific to clinical environments (b) evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating clinically driven design projects into the senior design program. Through weekly interaction with the faculty advisor, students will follow the traditional senior design process including Phase 1: Understanding wants and constraints, benchmarking. Phase 2: Concept generation, Phase 3: Concept selection and Phase 4: Working prototype. A process map will be used to make sure of the timely completion of the project. Deliverables for each of the projects include a first semester design review presentation and a final design presentation followed by a final report and a working prototype in the second semester. Final presentation will include introduction, project goals, design and development, summary of work, progress, and future work. We hope that exposure to guided but open-ended challenges from clinical professionals will broaden the students? understanding of clinical barrier and help them develop skills that will prepare them for successful careers in biomedical engineering. Demographic data and student surveys/interviews in both courses will be assessed yearly by the PIs and the External Advisory Board to ensure diversity, recruitment, student retention and attainment of the program goals."

Face-to-face Familias Unidas, a Hispanic-specific, family- centered intervention, has been found efficacious, relative to control conditions, in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior and drug use in two randomized clinical trials (Pantin et al., 2009; Prado et al., 2007).  Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to-face Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Community Practice Control in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time; (H2) Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to-face Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Community Practice Control in preventing adolescent drug use over time; (H3) Internet-Based Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than face-to-face Familias Unidas in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time; and (H4) Internet-Based Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than face-to-face Familias Unidas in preventing adolescent drug use over time.

"9607392","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Ovarian cancer represents the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women. However, the mechanisms of ovarian cancer development and its response to treatment remain to be elucidated. Our preliminary results show that ovarian cancer cells generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through NOX4 overexpression compared to immortalized normal ovary epithelial cells. Knockdown of NOX4 in cancer cells decreased ROS production, as well as expression of HER2, HER3 and ATG14. To test how NOX4 is upregulated in ovarian cancer cells, we find that HIF-1 and p70S6K1 are activated in these cells. It is known that HIF-1 and p70S6K1 are activated by oncogenes, such as PI3K and Ras, and by mutations of tumor suppressors, such as PTEN and p53. Our preliminary results indicate that HIF-1 and p70S6K1 induce NOX4 overexpression. We hypothesize that HIF-1 and p70S6K1 induce NOX4 overexpression, which in turn induces HER2/HER3 co-expression and ATG14 expression through miR-199a/miR-152 suppression, leading to ovarian tumor growth, angiogenesis, and therapeutic resistance. We will use multidisciplinary approaches, including molecular biology, animal models and human cancer tissue analysis, to test our hypothesis through three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine whether HIF-1 and p70S6K1 induce NOX4 expression, which in turn mediates HER2 and HER3 co-expression; whether NOX4 regulates trastuzumab treatment resistance through HER2 and HER3, and regulates radiation treatment resistance through induction of autophagy and ATG14 expression. We will manipulate expression of HIF-1, p70S6K1, NOX4 and other molecules in the cells and define the roles of these molecules in trastuzumab and radiation treatment responses. Aim 2 will determine whether NOX4 induces ovarian tumor growth through HER2 and HER3 co-expression via miR-199a suppression using an orthotopic ovarian tumor model, and determine whether NOX4 affects radiation treatment effect via ATG14 using image-guided radiotherapy. Aim 3 will determine whether NOX4 regulates tumor angiogenesis through HER2, HER3, and miR-199a suppression; and investigate whether levels of NOX4, ROS, HER2, HER3, miR-199a, and miR-152 correlate with advanced ovarian cancer stages and survival. Taken together, these results obtained from this application will establish a novel molecular mechanism of NOX4 signaling in regulating ovarian cancer development and provide proof- of-principle as to how NOX4 regulates radiation and trastuzumab treatment resistance. These results will provide the basis for designing a new therapeutic approach by targeting NOX4, HER2/HER3 co-expression, and/or ATG14 for ovarian cancer therapy. These studies will also provide new biomarker(s) using higher levels of NOX4, ROS, ATG14, and/or HER2/HER3 co-expression to predict advanced ovarian cancer stages, radiation or/and trastuzumab treatment resistance in the future."
"9442607","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urethritis is the most common male reproductive tract syndrome, yet up to 50% of cases have no known etiology. Recently, we found that Leptotrichia/Sneathia spp., newly described bacteria that are highly sensitive and specific for bacterial vaginosis (BV) in women, were significantly associated with idiopathic urethritis in men. Two other newly described bacteria (BV-associated bacterium [BVAB] 2, and BVAB3) were found more often in men with idiopathic urethritis than in control men, suggesting that all 3 of these bacteria may play a role in urethritis. Furthermore, men with idiopathic urethritis had urethral microbial communities that were distinct from those in healthy men, and relative abundance of Lactobacillis iners was consistently higher in men with urethritis, suggesting that changes in the urethral microbiota may also play a causal role in the development of urethritis. Given the relatively common nature of male urethritis, its propensity to recur, and the high proportion of unexplained cases, we propose a 2-tiered strategy to identify novel etiologies of this condition. In a species-specific approach, we will prospectively assess the relationship between 3 newly described bacteria (Leptotrichia/Sneathia spp., BVAB2, BVAB3) and the incidence, resolution and recurrence of urethritis using species-specific quantitative PCR. In a metagenomic approach, we will use broad range 16S rRNA gene PCR with pyrosequencing to describe the urethral bacterial biota in men over time and to assess whether changes in species composition of bacteria in microbial communities and/or relative abundance of specific bacteria (L. iners, among others) are associated with incidence, resolution and recurrence of urethritis. Finally, we hypothesize that these bacteria and bacterial communities are sexually transmitted and will assess the relationships between specific sexual exposures, acquisition of any of the 3 newly described bacteria and/or changes in microbial communities, and new onset of clinical signs and symptoms of urethritis. These studies will enhance the clinical management of male urethritis, and may lead to the development of new diagnostic tools, therapies and prevention strategies. Given the sexually transmitted nature of most genital tract bacteria, parallel benefits for clinical management of female reproductive tract disease may follow."
"9618374","Project Summary/Abstract Cellular transitions are fundamental to many steps of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Such transitions are broadly studied, but general models have been historically limited to qualitative descriptions. This contrasts with phase transitions in physical systems, which are well characterized within the context of the physico- chemical laws, and can be partially understood, in a predictive capacity, using simple, precise models such as the Ising model. Such models are based upon a system of interacting lattice sites. A parameter (e.g. Temperature) is varied, and the fluctuations of the lattice sites are analyzed as the system approaches and passes through a critical point. All critical system-specific details are captured in the interactions between the lattice sites, and the models can yield specific, experimentally verifiable predictions. Ising-like in silico models have guided theoretical studies of transitions in various gene or protein regulatory networks, although resultant predictions can be challenging to experimentally test. We seek a general approach where the experimental input is a statistically large number of single cell measurements, with many protein and metabolite analytes quantitatively measured per cell. From this data we capture the fluctuations and thereby determine the analyte-analyte correlations. In an Ising model analogy, such measurements define the site interactions. These inputs permit straightforward theoretic models for resolving cellular steady states, transitions between steady states, and for making testable predictions. Studies of the chemically-induced-carcinogenesis transition provide preliminary data/proof of concept. For Aim 1 we develop a picture of cancer cell steady states using integrated metabolic and proteomic single cell assays on cancer models of Glioblastoma Multiforme and Melanoma. In Aims 2 and 3 we expand this approach to two apparent cellular transitions associated with resistance against targeted therapies: the adaptation of heterogeneous brain cancers to certain targeted inhibitors, and a drug-induced cellular de-differentiation observed in melanomas and other tumors in response to immunotherapy and targeted inhibitors. All aims are joint experiment/theory aims. Aims 2-3 involve in vivo testing of predictions, as well as exome sequencing and global RNA-seq kinetic studies to complement the single cell kinetic analyses. Anticipated outcomes of the work include a general, quantitative approach towards describing cellular transitions associated with cancer. Further, we propose to mine those descriptions of cellular transitions to identify therapy combinations that are designed to hit targets that drive tumor growth, as well as those that drive the transition (and thus promote resistance) Preliminary data to support of this goal is provided. Additionally, guidance for non-continuous therapy dosing (e.g. metronomic or pulsatile regimens) that exploit knowledge of the kinetics, barriers, and reversibility of the transition to resistance is anticipated"
"9442818","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity is a serious public health problem. Although previous environmental approaches to obesity prevention show some promise, most studies have not shown excess weight gain reductions. Moreover, few childhood obesity prevention studies significantly engage parents or focus on the home environment, which is essential to promote healthy behaviors at home. Children in rural communities are particularly vulnerable regarding increased risk for obesity; thus, successful programs that engage families in rural communities to prevent excess weight gain are critical. The proposed research project, New Ulm-Healthy Home Environments via the Mealtime Environment (NU-HOME), is a unique collaboration between leaders in a rural community and successful academic obesity researchers. New Ulm, Minnesota is a rural community with obesity prevalence rates that far exceed national rates. Moreover, they are poised for and are requesting interventions to promote healthful behavior change, particularly for youth. In conjunction with our many community stakeholder groups, the objective of the proposed research is to test the effectiveness of the NU-HOME program, a 7-month, family-based health promotion intervention to prevent excess weight gain (assessed via BMI z-score) among 7-10 year old children (n=120) in the New Ulm rural community. The intervention program is based on Social Cognitive Theory and a socio-ecological framework and will focus on novel health promotion components to prevent childhood obesity, including: 1) promoting regular meals in which family members cook and eat together (i.e., family meals), 2) promoting nutritionally-sound and appropriately-portioned snacks and meals, 3) reducing sedentary behavior, particularly screen time in the home setting, and 4) promoting physical activity through collaboration with community partners. The NU-HOME study is designed in four stages, including substantial formative work between the academic and community partners, a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT; intervention and wait-list control), and two activities to facilitate sustainability (delayed intervention delivry for control group participants and dissemination). A community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach will be used to adapt an existing program that was piloted (HOME pilot: 2006-2008, NIH R21- DK0072997) and shown to be effective (HOME Plus: 2010-2015, NIH R01-DK084000) in urban communities. The NU-HOME program has high translation potential and is likely to be immediately useful to rural families of school-age children because it will be tested n a real-world setting in collaboration with engaged, knowledgeable and influential community partners."
"9447194","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Perinatal lung maturation allows transition to independent extrauterine life and requires concerted expansion of the epithelial gas exchange surface and the juxtaposed capillaries. Interruption of this process by premature birth is a major risk factor for serious lung diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that frequently manifests as alveolar simplification and dysmorphic capillaries. Although covering >95% of the alveolar surface and overlaying most of the alveolar vasculature, alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells are traditionally considered a passive structural component and attention has been focused on alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells because of their stem cell potential and role in surfactant production. This, combined with technical challenges in studying the ultra-thin (<0.1 um) AT1 cell extensions, results in our limited knowledge of the role of AT1 cells in normal and pathological alveologenesis. An in-depth understanding of AT1 cells during development is necessary to catch up with recent progress in studying AT2 cells and fibroblasts to obtain a complete picture of perinatal lung maturation. Our preliminary data support a novel hypothesis that AT1 cells have a signaling role in coordinating alveolar morphogenesis and angiogenesis during perinatal lung maturation. This proposal has the following three specific aims. (1) To determine whether AT1 cell development promotes alveolar angiogenesis. (2) To determine whether AT1 cell derived angiogenic factors promote alveolar angiogenesis. (3) To determine whether AT1 cell dysfunction contributes to hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. In summary, this proposal employs novel quantitative imaging and genetic tools to study the poorly understood and unexpected role of AT1 cells in perinatal lung maturation, and represents a step toward our long term goal of elucidating mechanisms and therapies of lung immaturity."
"9447105","Cryptosporidiosis is a globally important disease which is underappreciated as a cause of morbidity and mortality in children. It is also common in persons with AIDS and in children with persistent diarrhea who suffer growth retardation and malnutrition. No effective therapy exists. The recent Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) reported that moderate-to-severe diarrheal disease in the pediatric population in 4 sites in sub-Saharan Africa and 3 sites in South Asia, Cryptosporidium was second only to rotavirus as a cause of disease in children < 2 years of age. This application proposes to develop Cryptosporidium vaccines for humans. There are two species of this enteric parasite, C. hominis and C. parvum, both of which cause illness in humans, although C. hominis is more pathogenic and more frequently associated with disease in humans. The gnotobiotic (GB) piglet is the only model that results in diarrhea following challenge with C. hominis, while C. parvum infects all mammals including humans. Piglets that recover from Cryptosporidium diarrhea are significantly protected when re-challenged with the homologous species (Aim 1), and partially protected against C. parvum. We propose to perform a series of studies in piglets to address the fundamental hypothesis that specific antibodies protect against Cryptosporidium. Specific Aim 1: Re-demonstrate that C. hominis or C. parvum diarrheal infection of GB piglets results in active infection-derived immunity that is protective against parasite rechallenge. Specific Aim 2: Determine whether passive transfer of antibodies from immunized sows confers passive protection to their suckling offsprings against challenge with the homologous species. Specific Aim 3: Determine whether passive transfer of circulating or intestinal antibodies from immunized sows can protect GB piglets challenged with homologous or heterologous species. Specific Aim 4: Identify surface antigens of C. hominis and C. parvum sporozoites using immunoproteomics and reverse vaccinology approaches. Serum IgG and milk IgA from Aims 1 and 2 will be used in immunoproteomic techniques to identify antigen targets of these antibodies. Specific Aim 5: Determine whether putative C. hominis and C. parvum protective antigens identified in Aims 4 & 5 will protect GB piglets or mice when administered a) parenterally as purified proteins, b) expressed by a Salmonella Typhi live vector or c) in a prime boost strategy (prime with live vector followed by a boost with purified antigen)."

"9445648","ABSTRACT We have identified a subset of ciliated cells (30%) in the mouse and human airways that express MIWI2, a protein only previously observed in the mouse testes where it functions to suppress transposon transcription. Newly generated ontogeny data along with global transcriptomic and gene ontology analyses of mouse MIWI2-positive (MPACs) and negative ciliated cells (non-MPACs) further support the concept of multiciliated cell heterogeneity and our overall hypothesis: MIWI2-positive expression distinguishes 2 distinct ciliated cell lineages in the airway. For the first time, these data hint at functionally distinct multi-ciliated cell subsets and suggest new lineage models for the airway epithelium. In view of the broader implications of this work for the field, our over-riding objective and focus in this revised grant are to develop and elucidate a basic understanding of the differential biology of these 2 subtypes of ciliated cells in the mouse airway. As a result, many of our studies are now deliberately and logically directed at characterizing the ontogeny, half-life, and origins of MPACs relative to non-MPACs. Our data also indicate that ciliated cells play a distinct role in regulating inflammation during injury, a function not generally ascribed to this cell type. Determining the relative role of MPACs and non-MPACs and ciliated MIWI2 in regulating inflammatory states in the lung are thus important sub-goals of this proposal. In our view, identifying immune-regulatory roles for ciliated cells has not been sufficiently addressed since most of the research on this cell type has traditionally concentrated on their mechanical contributions to mucus clearance. As such, this direction lends a deeper and more expansive significance to our proposed studies. By using several unique genetic mouse models that sustain the identification, tracking, and fate of ciliated cells, including MPACs, we propose to examine our hypothesis and meet our goals in 3 Aims. In Aim 1 we well establish the ontogeny of MPACs, their lineage relationship to non-MPACS and their half-life during lung homeostasis. In Aim 2, we will identify the origin of new MPACs that arise during airway remodeling after lung infection and during MPAC- specific cell regeneration. In Aim 3, we will determine the relative roles of MIWI2 protein and MPACs in the host response to early lung inflammation and infection. Together, these studies will forge new directions in the fundamental biology of the airway by establishing a new understanding of epithelial cell lineages and by integrating and connecting the fields of Piwi proteins, inflammation, and multiciliated cells of the lung."
"9475024","PROJECT SUMMARY ? PROJECT 1 (AIM 4): Multi-scale modeling of adaptive drug resistance in BRAF- mutant melanoma. The overall goal of Project 1 is to develop an integrated, quantitative understanding of adaptive drug resistance to targeted BRAF and MEK kinase inhibitors in melanoma, with comparative studies performed in BRAF mutant thyroid and colorectal cancers. One of the primary challenges in understanding adaptive drug resistance is the sheer diversity of proposed mechanisms, ranging from reactivation of MAPK signaling, to engagement of parallel PI3K/mTOR/AKT signaling cascades and altered receptor trafficking. Individual published studies focus on subsets of these phenomena, often in different cell lines, and it remains unclear whether differences in emphasis reflect differences in the underlying biology, methodology (single cell RNASeq v. proteomics for example) or time scale (hours vs. weeks). One possibility is that the phenomenological diversity masks the operation of a common mechanism, in which feedback pathways, receptor trafficking, and parallel signaling cascades all play a role. However, because a single patient can harbor melanomas each with a different set of resistance mutations, the observed diversity is likely to be meaningful. The other extreme is that every tumor finds a unique way to become drug resistant, and that we will discover few if any underlying principles. We believe that the most likely explanation lies midway between these extremes: adaptation involves a handful of biochemically distinct mechanisms that can have a variety of presentations depending on cell type, microenvironment, assay method and time scale. We will test this hypothesis by studying adaptive resistance with detailed kinetic modeling and single cell data in a few BRAF-mutant cell lines combined with more phenomenological modeling in a wider range of cell types. Aim 4.1 will use single-cell data and ODE networks to study homeostasis in immediate-early BRAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signaling in four cell lines to elucidate the role played by negative feedback loops involving phosphatases and adaptor proteins. Aim 4.2 will examine the phenomenon of de-differentiation and the generation of slowly cycling drug-insensitive cells likely to contribute to residual disease. Aim 4.3 will use similar in-depth methods to study changes in ADAM protease activity and receptor shedding that cause sustained autocrine and paracrine signaling and increased MAPK activity. Aim 4.4 will look at the time evolution of adaptation based on preliminary evidence showing that, in a single cell line, adaptations can involve MAPK feedback in the short term (1-2 days) and de-differentiation and changes in receptor biology on a longer term (days to weeks). Aim 4.5 will use multi-omic analysis across a panel of 20 BRAF mutant cells lines to establish the extent of variability in mechanisms analyzed in Aims 4.1 to 4.4. Statistical and machine learning approaches will identify the changes in intracellular and autocrine/endocrine signaling most consequential for phenotype."
"9533372","Project Summary/Abstract  Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 68 children and is characterized by lifelong impairment in social interactions. Autism affects multiple brain structures including the prefrontal cortex, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Recent gene sequencing studies have identi?ed hundreds of mutations associated with the disease. Since each mutation is individually rare, studying a single mutation does not provide broad insight into common disease mechanisms. The study of many genes in parallel could provide generalized insight, but such efforts are limited to resource intensive settings such as large-scale consortia. Therefore, experimental approaches that allow a single investigator to study the functional impact for many autism mutations simultaneously would greatly expedite discovery.  Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are an ideal system for parallel studies of gene function: 1) hPSCs are amenable to facile genome editing technologies, allowing rapid construction of many genetic disease lines; 2) hPSCs can differentiate into any cell-type of the body, offering unprecedented access to disease-tissue; 3) individual hPSC lines can in theory be pooled into a single assay, supporting increased throughput of genetic analysis. The goal of this study is to develop a multiplex hPSC platform where multiple disease lines are pooled into a single differentiation and analysis assay. The utility of this approach will be validated by testing a set of autism mutations for shared molecular and developmental phenotypes. Successful completion of this study will provide novel insights into underlying mechanisms of autism. Importantly, it will establish a scalable, ?exible hPSC platform that to could be applied to decode the functional architecture of all autism mutations. This proposal effectively supports the development of an aspiring physician-scientist in using human stem cells to study brain development and complex disease."
"9447192","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tissues respond in different ways to injury to repair and regenerate lost cells and damaged architecture. The lung responds robustly to injury through activation of spatially restricted stem/progenitor cell populations and through re-entry of differentiated cells into the cell cycle. This robust response to injury stands in contrast to the normal homeostatic state, which is remarkably quiescent. One school of thought suggests that quiescence is a default state in many tissues resulting from lack of growth stimuli as demonstrated in culture conditions. However, this does not fully explain how cells remain quiescent within a complex microenvironment in vivo during tissue homeostasis. An alternative hypothesis is that quiescence is actively maintained through as yet unknown molecular pathways. Such an active process would be important for the delicate balance between cellular quiescence required for maintaining tissue integrity during normal homeostasis and the rapid regenerative response after injury. Such information is important given that disruption in this state could lead to re-activation of cell proliferation in an uncontrolled manner and may underlie several lung diseases including pulmonary fibrosis and cancer. The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a hallmark signaling pathway that coordinates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during development in multiple organs including the lung, through paracrine activation of smoothened (Smo)-mediated downstream signaling events. Of the three known Hh ligands, sonic hedgehog (Shh) is the best understood, is highly expressed during lung development, and plays an essential role in lung morphogenesis. Despite its clear role in organ development, little is known about whether or how Hh signaling coordinates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the adult lung to maintain tissue homeostasis or modulate injury and regeneration. Hh signaling activity has been noted in the adult lung through expression of the downstream effector Gli1, along with studies suggesting hedgehog promotes mesenchymal proliferation in vitro. However, Hh's function in normal adult tissue quiescence or its role in injury and regeneration in the lung has not been examined in in vivo models. Our preliminary data suggest that Hh signaling is active in the adult lung and is used to maintain mesenchymal quiescence during normal homeostasis as well as after injury in the proximal airways. Thus, Hh signaling plays a critical role in maintainig lung quiescence and is important in the response of the lung to injury."
"9459387","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over three million pregnant women labor and give birth in the United States every year. Despite the frequency of this event, many aspects of labor management lack evidence. The second stage of labor, defined as the interval from complete cervical dilation through delivery of the fetus, is the most physiologically demanding period of labor for both the mother and the fetus. Despite the huge impact labor management can have on mode of delivery and neonatal and maternal morbidities, the optimal technique for managing maternal pushing during the second stage of labor is unknown. The two most common approaches involve either allowing for spontaneous descent (delayed pushing) or initiating pushing with uterine contractions once complete cervical dilation occurs (immediate pushing). Prior studies comparing these approaches reported results that are contradictory with regard to benefit and harm to the neonate and mother. Despite these data, delayed pushing gained wide spread use with a perception that it improves rates of vaginal delivery and reduces morbidities. By contrast, our recent meta-analysis demonstrated that among high-quality trials, delayed pushing did not improve the spontaneous vaginal delivery rate, but prolonged second stage duration. Notably, the largest trial evaluated outcome measures that are obsolete in contemporary obstetrics in the United States, such as use of mid-pelvic rotational forceps. Results of our large observational study indicated that selection to delayed pushing is associated with worse labor outcomes than immediate pushing. The lack of a modern, large, well- controlled, randomized clinical trial to address this question has led to uncertainty as to which technique for maternal pushing in the second stage of labor optimizes outcomes. In addition, effects of immediate versus delayed pushing on risk of maternal pelvic floor injury remain unknown. Given that approximately 11,000 women labor and deliver daily in the United States, there is an urgent need to fill this important clinical knowledge gap and provide high-quality evidence to inform contemporary obstetric management of the second stage of labor. We propose a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of immediate versus delayed pushing for nulliparous women in labor at term reaching complete cervical dilation. Our central hypothesis is that immediate pushing in the second stage of labor increases spontaneous vaginal delivery, shortens duration of the second stage, and reduces adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes in nulliparous women. We will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Assess the effectiveness of immediate pushing at complete cervical dilation on the rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery in nulliparous women (Primary Aim), 2) Determine the effect of immediate pushing on the rate of neonatal composite morbidity (Secondary Aim #1), and 3) Determine the impact of immediate versus delayed pushing on objective and subjective measures of maternal pelvic floor morbidity (Secondary Aim #2). We estimate that randomizing a total of 3184 women will provide adequate statistical power to detect meaningful differences in the primary and secondary outcomes."
"9439813","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regulation of dynamic microtubules (MTs) is critical for cellular processes such as cell division, cell migration, cell polarity, organelle movements and nuclear positioning. Understanding conserved mechanisms of MT regulation are highly relevant to human biology and diseases such as cancer, neuronal diseases and wound healing. In this grant, we aim to elucidate fundamental conserved mechanisms responsible for MT regulation by studying MT plus end tracking proteins (+TIPs). These proteins coat the MT plus end and control the assembly, stability and disassembly of these polymers. In general, how these proteins work collectively to regulate MT dynamics in vivo is a pressing question in this active field. We study MT regulation using in vivo and in vitro approaches, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a tractable, simple model system. The XMAP215/Alp14 family of +TIPs is emerging as one of the most important of the +TIPs. These tubulin-binding proteins function as MT polymerases that add tubulin onto the ends of growing MT. Our preliminary results suggest that it has additional functions in MT nucleation and disassembly. Our specific aims are: 1) To define how Alp14 works with gamma tubulin complex for MT nucleation; 2) To determine how Alp14 and the kinesin-8 Klp5/6 regulate the disassembly of MTs; 3) To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of how XMAP215/Alp14 proteins interact with tubulin to regulate MT dynamics."
"9433688","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study will elucidate mechanisms of immune responses to factor VIII (FVIII) in hemophilia A patients and explore FVIII sequence modifications that could be translated to make less immunogenic products for replacement therapy. A primary goal is to reduce the incidence and burden of neutralizing anti-factor VIII (FVIII) antibodies, referred to as inhibitors, which can lead to life-threatening bleeds that are extremely expensive and difficult to manage. This project seeks to better characterize the mechanisms of these pathological immune responses by mapping T-cell and B-cell epitopes on FVIII, and then applying this information to modify its amino acid sequence to render it less immunogenic (stimulatory to helper T cells) and antigenic (stimulatory to memory B cells and recognized by antibodies). The availability of less immunogenic/antigenic FVIII proteins would significantly reduce mortality, morbidity and costs of effective treatment. The novel methodologies under development in our laboratory are also broadly applicable to investigations of other pathological immune responses to therapeutic proteins, which are a concern that accompanies the development of any protein drug and which are generally not predicted accurately using animal models for preclinical testing. Several studies have indicated that African American patients have a higher incidence of inhibitors than Caucasians. Approximately half of our subject population is African American, ensuring that this patient subgroup is well represented in our studies. The related goals of this project are: 1. To map and then neutralize immunodominant T-cell epitopes in FVIII, generating FVIII proteins that are less likely to stimulate the immune system of patients with susceptible HLA types. T-cell responses to FVIII will be detected and characterized using ELISpot assays and MHC Class II tetramers loaded with synthetic FVIII peptides. The immunogenicity of FVIII peptides and proteins with modified amino acid sequences will then be evaluated utilizing primary and cloned human T cells from hemophilia A subjects. 2. To map and then neutralize B-cell epitopes, generating FVIII proteins capable of evading inhibitory antibodies. We are developing novel approaches to evaluate antibody- antigen interactions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), in which plasma/serum samples are analyzed to determine antibody titers, apparent antibody affinities for immobilized FVIII, and B-cell epitopes. 3. To generate novel FVIII proteins with translational potential, in which T-cell and B-cell epitopes have been neutralized while retaining procoagulant activity comparable to that of wild-type FVIII. Immunogenicity of rationally designed, sequence-modified FVIII proteins will be tested using T-cell stimulation assays. Antigenicity of the proteins will be evaluated using Bethesda, ELISA and novel SPR assays."
"9444481","PROJECT SUMMARY Because of the staggering complexity of biological systems, biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge stored in a computable form. The Gene Ontology (GO) is by far the largest knowledgebase of how genes function, and has become a critical component of the computational infrastructure enabling the genomic revolution. It has become nearly indispensible in the interpretation of large- scale molecular measurements in biological research. Crucially, for human health research, GO is also one of a suite of complementary ontologies constructed in such as way to maximally promote interoperability and comparability of data sets. It represents the gene functions and biological processes that are perturbed in human disease, e.g. via the links from Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) class abnormality of lipid metabolism, defined in relation to the GO class lipid metabolic process (GO_0006629), researchers or clinicians can find the set of genes that are known to be involved in this process. GO is a knowledge resource that can be statistically mined, either standalone or in combination with data from other knowledge resources, which enables experts to discover connections and form new hypotheses from the biological networks GO represents. All knowledge in GO is represented using semantic web technologies and so is amenable to computational integration and consistency checking. The proposed GO knowledge environment will enable a wider community of scientists to contribute to, and to utilize, a common, computable representation of biology. To ensure the knowledge environment meets the requirements of biomedical researchers, we will: a) deliver a comprehensive, detailed, computable knowledgebase of gene function, encoded in the Gene Ontology and annotations (computer-readable statements about the how specific genes function), focusing on human biology; b) provide a ?hub? for a broad community of scientists to collaboratively extend, correct and improve the knowledgebase; c) ensure the GO knowledge resource is of the highest quality with regards to depth, breadth and accuracy; d) facilitate the transfer of insights obtained from studies of non-human organisms, such as the mouse and zebrafish, to human biology; and e) enable the scientific community to use the knowledgebase in analyses of large-scale genetic and -omics data. Our aims reflect the essential requirements for realizing the overarching objectives for a biomedical data resource: efficiently capturing and integrating biological knowledge and adhering to the highest possible standard for accuracy and detail; constructing and providing a robust, flexible, powerful, and extensible technological infrastructure available not only for internal use but just as easily by the wider community; and lastly, leveraging state-of-the-art social media, web services and other technologies to disseminate the GO resource to the entire biomedical research community."

"9588309","?    DESCRIPTION: HIV-1 causes a persistent infection due to long-lived reservoirs of latently infected cells that present a barrier to achieving a cure. There are active efforts ongoing to eliminate the latently infected cells by using drugs that antagonize latency and activate viral gene expression. To date, the antagonists that have been identified tend to reactivate viral gene expression without efficiently killing the infected cells and clearing the reservoirs. Therefore, i may be necessary to develop immunotherapeutic approaches to ultimately clear the virus and cure disease. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which can recognize actively infected cells may aid in the clearance of reservoirs treated with latency antagonists. However, CTLs are limited in the extent to which they can effectively clear infection. Our long-term goal is to understand how to enable the immune response to more effectively recognize and eradicate latently infected cells that have been treated with latency antagonists. The overall objective of this application, which is the next step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to identify compounds that maximize viral antigen presentation in HIV-infected cells. We hypothesize that while CTLs have activity against latently infected cells that have been induced to express HIV-1 genes, HIV-1 Nef, which down modulates MHC-I, limits the extent to which induced cells can be killed. Preliminary studies indicate that Nef inhibitors found in natural product extracts can reverse the effects of Nef and sensitize infected cells to CTL killing. These studies have led to the hypothesis that combination therapy with latency antagonists plus Nef inhibitors could act synergistically to clear reservoirs. The R21 phase of this proposal aims to complete the identification of inhibitory factors in high priority natural product extracts that contain anti-Nef activity. Upon successful completion of the R21 phase, The R33 phase will involve (1) determining the mechanism by which each factor inhibits Nef-mediated MHC-1 down modulation and (2) conducting lead compound optimization to improve the pharmaceutical properties and identify a leading drug candidate for development."
"9469826","Project Summary We propose to introduce and optimize a new method of radiomics extraction via transfer learning with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and to compare it to the conventional segmentation-based radiomics approach on breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRIs). The field of breast radiomics has been expanding fast, with many clinical conclusions being successfully derived from medical images using qualitative analysis. In the past couple of years, deep learning has experienced explosive growth in image recognition, easily solving complex problems. Deep CNNs achieve remarkable classification results on everyday image datasets. We propose to investigate the utility of deep neural networks with regards to the medical image datasets, specifically on the breast DCE-MRI dataset. Given the relatively small sizes of these datasets, CNNs previously trained on non-medical images will be utilized for clinical classifications as feature extractors. We will investigate multiple parameters involved in the CNN feature extraction methodology and their effect on classification performance. Two clinical tasks will be studied under the proposed research: 1) malignancy assessment and 2) response to therapy prediction. The optimized CNN method will be compared to and combined with the conventional segmentation- based radiomics method. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the robustness of the segmentation-based features across MR scanners of different manufacturers. The first aim of the proposed research will study the robustness of the segmentation- based features extracted from images acquired on MR scanners of two different manufacturers. The robustness will be investigated under four clinical tasks, such as lymph node involvement and receptor statuses. The second aim will be focused on optimization of CNN feature extraction and subsequent classifier design. Lastly, under the third aim we will compare and combine the CNN and segmentation-based radiomics in the classification tasks of malignancy assessment and response to therapy prediction."
"9589946","Project Summary While cancer has traditionally been viewed as a disease process based on genetic aberrations, there is increasing evidence that epigenetic alterations play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of many types of cancer. One emerging epigenetic driver of cancer is the super-enhancer, which is defined as a series of traditional enhancers in close physical proximity that determine cell state and cell identity. Super- enhancers define cell state, are associated with genes that control cell type specific biology, and are enriched for disease-associated genetic variation. Super-enhancers identified from cancer cells identify tumor- associated genes in glioblastoma, small cell lung cancer, and multiple myeloma. Because of the close association between super-enhancer structure and biological function, study of the alterations in disease- specific super-enhancers may reveal insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor, with poor responses to all therapeutic modalities despite intensive research. One major contributor to the poor prognosis of glioblastoma is the presence of cancer stem cells. These self-renewing tumor cells play a role in resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, as well as maintenance of tumor heterogeneity and angiogenesis. Because of these features, cancer stem cells have become an important target for the design of novel therapeutic strategies. To better understand key regulators of glioma stem cell identity, an original super-enhancer screen identified genes that are epigenetically upregulated in glioma stem cells and for which elevated expression is associated with poor patient prognosis. This approach revealed lipid metabolism pathways and specifically the gene ELOVL2, which is a lead candidate for further evaluation. Cancer cells utilize aberrant metabolic processes to drive increased proliferation and altered signaling. While lipid metabolism has been implicated in the process of oncogenesis, the precise functions of ELOVL2 have not been defined in cancer. The first aim will define the role of ELOVL2 in glioma cell survival, self-renewal capacity, and tumor formation in both in vitro and in vivo settings. The second aim will investigate the transcription factor network that regulates the expression of ELOVL2 including enhancer elements, transcription factor occupancy, and super-enhancer structure. These approaches will lead to a greater understanding of the epigenetic features that define the glioma stem cell state and inform the development of novel therapeutics."
"9475020","SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy."
"9541938","Project Summary This project aims to understand how coordinated regulation of two key signaling pathways regulates differentiation and tumor grade in salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC). Alterations in the activation of these pathways produce the extreme intra-tumoral cellular heterogeneity characteristic of salivary MEC tumors. These tumors are marked by the presence of variable proportions of three major cell types: an epidermoid or squamous cell type, a mucous-containing cell type, and an intermediate cell type. Intermediate cells represent a poorly differentiated cell type that can give rise to both epidermoid- and mucous-type cells. In more aggressive high-grade MECs, the intermediate cell tends to predominate, while mucous and epidermoid cells are more prevalent in low-grade MECs, highlighting the need to understand the drivers regulating differentiation in these tumors. Notably, over 50% of salivary MECs are characterized by a t(11;19) chromosomal translocation that results in a CRTC1/MAML2 (C1/M2) fusion oncoprotein. Recent whole-exome sequencing data from human MEC salivary tumors has shown that copy number variations and somatic mutations are lacking in most C1/M2-positive tumors, suggesting that C1/M2 is the main oncogenic driver in these salivary MECs. Previous research has demonstrated that C1/M2 triggers CREB-dependent gene expression and also interacts with MYC, amplifying expression of MYC transcriptional targets. Both CREB and MYC play key roles in controlling differentiated or stem-like states, respectively, in epithelial cells. Thus, the degree to which C1/M2 regulates targets within each pathway may influence the differentiation state of tumor cells, enabling the rise of a heterogeneous population of cell types within a single tumor. Mechanistically, the differential activation of CREB or MYC target genes by C1/M2 may regulate the progression of these cancers from low to high-grade, therefore, the working hypothesis for this proposal is that variations in CREB and MYC regulation accounts for the cellular heterogeneity observed in MEC tumors. To test these hypotheses, this proposal aims to (1) isolate and phenotypically characterize the epidermoid, mucous, and intermediate cell types and (2) explore the relative contributions of CREB- and MYC-driven pathways to the different cell types observed in MEC tumors."
"9437565","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is an aggressive carcinoma with intrinsic resistance to current therapies and poor clinical outcome. Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD), a chronic pathological condition in which the esophagus is exposed to acidic gastric juice mixed with bile salts, is the main risk factor for the development of Barrett's esophagus, a glandular metaplasia that carries a high risk for progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Our preliminary data has shown that AXL is a pro-survival protein that protects cancer cells against genotoxic DNA damaging events such as exposure to acidic bile salts and chemotherapeutics. Based on these novel preliminary data, we plan to investigate the mechanistic and biological roles of AXL in mediating response to genotoxic acidic bile-salts and DNA damaging drugs, and determine the clinical and therapeutic potential of AXL in EAC. Supported by preliminary data, we hypothesize that loss of p53 mediates up-regulation of AXL protein in EAC. The overexpression of AXL provides important pro-survival, pro-invasion, and malignant transformation activities by regulating the protein levels of both nuclear and cytosolic c-ABL in response to genotoxic stress. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Investigate the role of p53 in regulating AXL protein level; 2) Investigate the role of AX in regulating c-ABL function in Barrett's and EAC cells; 3) Determine the clinical significance and therapeutic potential of AXL in EAC. In Aim 1, the molecular mechanisms by which p53 negatively regulates AXL protein expression will be investigated. In Aim 2, studies will be undertaken to determine the role of AXL in regulating cytosolic c-ABL protein expression and stability. Additionally, the role of AXL in regulating c- ABL-dependent cell survival, invasion, an malignant transformation will be examined. In Aim 3, a comprehensive study will be undertaken to examine the clinical and histopathological parameters associated with AXL and c-ABL protein expressions in human EAC, using IHC analysis of normal, premalignant, and EAC tissue microarrays. Also, the potential of AXL as a therapeutic target will be evaluated using the AXL inhibitor R428/BGB324 or genetic knockdown alone, or in combination with cisplatin, docetaxel, or oxaliplatin in pre- clinical settings (xenograft mouse model). The approach is innovative because it is based on an innovative hypothesis that proposes the AXL-ABL axis as an important player in Barrett's carcinogenesis, mechanistic studies of AXL and c-ABL relevant to their combined tumorigenic functions, advanced methodologies, and the potential development of novel targeted therapy in EAC. The proposed research is significant because it fills in a critical gap in our understanding of the functions of AXL in EAC. Upon completion of the proposed research, we will have a better understanding of the biology of EAC which could provide new translational opportunities that facilitate the development of better therapeutic and prognostic approaches."
"9592761","Project Summary Normal vision relies on the coordinated activity of numerous highly specialized cells organized within the eye and in projection areas within the brain. In the eye, the retina develops through a series of sequential cell differentiation steps tht culminate in the generation of the different retinal cell types properly organized within the laminated structure of the mature retina. A complex network of transcription factors and extracellular signaling molecules regulates this process. Although a number of the regulatory molecules that control fate specification and differentiation of retinal cells have been already identified, we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating retinal development. The long-term goal of this project is to identify key gene regulators of retinal progenitor cell differentiation in general and photoreceptor differentiation n particular. Within this framework, we have identified CTCF, a multifunctional transcriptional regulator previously unknown to participate in these phenomena, as a leading candidate in regulating several aspects of retinal cell differentiation. Based on our observations we have hypothesized that CTCF regulates the initial specification of neural retina progenitor cells from the pool of uncommitted progenitors within the optic vesicle, and promotes their subsequent survival and differentiation toward a photoreceptor lineage. We will use loss- and gain-of-function approaches, and their complementary phenoytype-rescue strategies, to investigate these hypotheses. These studies will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms driving retina development in normal and diseased conditions and to build up an integrated network of the molecules involved in this process. This knowledge in turn, is expected to have a significant impact on the potential prevention of developmental abnormalities of the retina and the development of feasible stem cell-based therapeutic treatments for retinal degenerative diseases."
"9523496","The ideal treatments for cancer achieve a therapeutic index by exploiting the differences between cancerous and normal cells. Here we describe an approach to develop targeted cancer therapies that relies on selective activation of a pro-drug by specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Compared to normal cells, many cancers express higher levels of CYP enzymes, which metabolize xenobiotics. We seek to exploit the high expression of CYP enzymes to locally convert an inert molecule into a cytotoxin within the tumor through metabolic activation. In the Preliminary Results section we describe tumor-targeted inhibitors of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD). This enzyme catalyzes the introduction of unsaturation into fatty acids. Tumor cells require high levels of unsaturated fatty acids and are therefore sensitive to SCD inhibitors. They exist in a nutrient poor environment and require de novo synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids to synthesize membranes, maintain membrane fluidity, and buffer the cell from the toxic effects of saturated fatty acids and free cholesterol. Indeed, our SCD inhibitors display low nM toxicity towards cultured human cancer cells.  While inhibition of SCD in the liver is non-toxic, and inhibition of SCD within tumors arrests their growth, inhibition of SCD in the skin results in toxicity that presents an obstacle to the clinical development of conventional SCD inhibitors. Specifically, mice treated with known inhibitors suffer atrophy of sebocytes. These skin cells require SCD to synthesize sebum, which contains esters of fatty acids and fatty alcohols. Sebum is excreted onto the skin by hair follicles to reduce heat loss and onto the eyes and eyelids for lubrication. As a result of sebocyte atrophy, mice treated with SCD inhibitors suffer from dry eye, dry skin and hypothermia.  In summary, SCD activity is critical for tumor growth, dispensable in the liver, but also required in the skin. An ideal anti-cancer treatment would therefore inhibit SCD in the tumor but not skin cells. Here we demonstrate the discovery of such tumor-targeted agents. We show that they are inert in their pro-drug form, but low nM inhibitors of SCD in their active form. Furthermore, we show that they are activated in tumors, but not in skin. Initial in vivo experiments demonstrate both tumor growth inhibition and an improved therapeutic index relative to non-targeted inhibitors of SCD. We describe plans to characterize the inhibitors' interactions with SCD, optimize them for in vivo utility, and fully evaluate their therapeutic potential as anti-cancer agents in rodent models of lung and liver cancer.  The proposed studies should identify an optimized, targeted inhibitor of SCD suitable for advanced pre- clinical development including IND-enabling toxicology, formulation and manufacturing (not proposed). If successful, we will have identified an approach to targeted cancer therapies that exploits a metabolic weakness of cancer cells. While not proposed here, we recognize that this strategy could be tuned to exploit other over-expressed CYP isoforms and/or other classes of cytotoxins."
"9500325","Project Summary  Understanding the life cycle of a pathogen within different natural environments is a poorly evolved area of infectious disease research. Tick-borne relapsing fever (RF) spirochetes are one such pathogen that have adapted to colonize arthropods and mammalian blood. When a tick imbibes an infectious bloodmeal, spi- rochetes enter the midgut. Within ~ 2 weeks a population subsequently migrates and colonizes the salivary glands. However, the molecular events facilitating vector colonization and subsequent transmission to the mammalian host remain unclear. Consequently, delineating the intricacies of the life cycle of RF spirochetes is particularly relevant to public health.  Limitations in RF spirochete genomics, transcriptomics, and genetics have been addressed by develop- ing the Borrelia turicatae-Ornithodoros turicata model. Utilizing a functional genomic approach, two important observations were made that this proposal builds upon: 1) after 220 generations, B. turicatae losses genes es- sential in vector colonization and/or establishing mammalian infection; 2) the 150 kb linear megaplasmid (lp150) is likely important for vector colonization and transmission. A 36 kb locus toward the 3' end of the plas- mid contains a series of genes that coded for surface proteins that are up-regulated in the tick vector compared to infected mammalian blood. The central hypothesis of this application is that there are subsets of B. turicatae genes essential in midgut and salivary gland colonization and establishing early mammalian infection. The fol- lowing aims are purposed: Aim 1: Identify genes that are essential in the tick-mammalian transmission cycle by comparative ge- nomics, and define temporal expression and protein production of B. turicatae genes localized in the 36 kb locus. The objective is to quantify the expression of genes in the 36 kb locus during the pathogens life cycle in the tick vector, and coincide the findings with protein production. Also, a comparative genomic analysis between a wild type spirochetes and noncolonizing/noninfectious strains will identify likely essential genes. Aim 2: Identify and characterize genes essential in vector colonization and transmission by mutagene- sis, imaging, and structural and biophysical analyses. The objective is to generate and evaluate B. tu- ricatae mutants, to identify defects in tick-mediated transmission to mice. The significance of these genes in the tick-mammalian transmission cycle will be further verified by site directed mutagenesis and structural and biophysical analyses.  With the surface proteome of RF spirochetes serving essential roles in pathogenesis, these findings will guide strategies to interrupt the pathogen's life cycle in the tick and mammal. The results will be broadly appli- cable to Old and New World species, and address NIAID's mission to better understand and prevent disease."
"9452926","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to identify and characterize drug-like molecules that inhibit ciliary Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Cells orchestrate their behaviors by communicating through secreted signals such as Hh proteins. Unlike other intercellular signals, mammalian Hh proteins are transduced through primary cilia, microtubule-based projections on the surface of many cells. The Reiter lab discovered that a central component of the Hh pathway, Smoothened (Smo), moves to the primary cilium in response to Hh stimulation where it activates the downstream pathway. The cilium is essential for Hh signaling both in embryonic development and in oncogenesis. Activating mutations in Smo cause basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common cancer in the U.S., and medulloblastoma, the most common solid cancer in children. A Smo antagonist was recently approved for clinical use, although cancers can become resistant quickly. Smo antagonists that act through complementary mechanisms may prevent the emergence of resistance in Hh-associated cancers. To identify novel Hh pathway antagonists and gain insight into ciliary function, the Reiter and Arkin labs completed a pilot screen for inhibitors of Smo movement to cilia. This screen identified novel inhibitors, some of which block BCC cell growth by inhibiting Smo translocation and some of which block ciliogenesis. Investigating the mechanisms by which these inhibitors act revealed previously unknown aspects of ciliary Hh signaling. This project will expand the screen, identify the molecular mechanisms underlying inhibitor action, and understand ciliary signaling. Specifically, we will: 1) screen in-house and Chemical Biology Consortium libraries, substantially expanding the chemical space that has been assessed, 2) execute secondary screens to efficiently identify inhibitors that act through previously undescribed mechanisms, 3) use newly identified antagonists, together with unique genetic tools, to uncover unrecognized steps of ciliogenesis and Smo translocation. Despite their importance to both development and disease, the mechanisms underlying ciliogenesis and Hh signaling remain unclear. The proposed investigation will provide tools to reveal how cells communicate through cilia. These compounds may also provide leads for novel chemotherapeutics, critical for preventing the emergence of resistance and relapse in Hh pathway-associated cancers."

"9465984","Abstract A universal influenza vaccine that is capable of protecting against all strains of influenza is a high priority. The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) estimate the economic impact of seasonal influenza in the United States to range from $10 to $16 billion and pandemic influenza to range from $71.3 to $166.5 billion. The proposed research directly addresses the limitations of both pandemic and seasonal flu vaccines. Versatope has developed a unique influenza M2e antigen construct, expressed in Escherichia coli and derived from recombinant outer membrane vesicles (rOMVs) or M2e-rOMVs, that is potentially effective against all strains of influenza. These rOMVs that display influenza M2e proteins represent a potentially safe and simple subunit vaccine delivery platform that will increase the range of protection against multiple strains of pandemic and seasonal influenza and reduce the overall economic impact. We are the first company to leverage our OMV to use one vaccine candidate to express heterologous antigens (proteins from a different organism) and provide 100% protection against several strains of influenza in mice having different genetic backgrounds and different species of animals (mice and ferrets). The unique rOMVs we created do not trigger a pyrogenic response in human blood, but induce effective immune protection against H1N1 in BALB/c mice, H1N1 in C57BL/6 mice, and H3N2 in BALB/c mice. The OMV vaccine delivery is innovative because our strain has been genetically engineered to detoxify lipopolysaccharide (LPS) more than 1000-fold (they do not require chemical extraction of LPS to detoxify the final product) and to increase OMV formation more than 30-fold compared to the parental strain of pro-biotic bacteria. To demonstrate the societal impact and commercial opportunity of the M2e-rOMVs, we applied these protection parameters to CDC epidemiologic models of pandemic influenza and calculated a 50% a reduction in infection, hospitalization and death rates. Collectively, these results underlie the justification and commercial opportunity for the proposed research. Our proposed research program is primarily translational, the outcome of which will guide the path toward a viable single-dose vaccine for pandemic influenza A. The development of this new rM2e-rOMV derived from chromosomal integration will enable large-scale production suitable for non-clinical development and toxicology, clinical studies, and commercial development. The specific focus for the current proposal is the development of new rOMV strains capable of protection against pandemic influenza and suitable for fermentation on a large scale. We will also identify the minimum dose required for immunogenicity to initiate safety/toxicity studies. The M2e vaccine candidate expressed in OMVs that we have developed is a significant improvement over traditional influenza vaccine candidates because immunity is imparted to multiple strains and the OMVs have lower reactogenicity and inflammatory responses compared to other approaches."
"9441039","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with schizophrenia tend to have deficits in a range of learning and memory processes, as well as specific deficits in visual perception. All of these deficits are associated with poor functional outcomes, and current treatments do little to address them. One type of learning that might be important for outcomes, called perceptual learning, is potentially related to both types of deficits but has hardly been studied in schizophrenia. Perceptual learning refers to long-lasting changes in the way that particular sensory stimuli are perceived after they are encountered repeatedly, which are related to changes in the way those stimuli are processed in the brain. Perceptual learning deficits likely exist in schizophrenia, like other types of learning deficits and perceptual deficits, but this hypothesis has not yet been adequately tested. This proposal will evaluate perceptual learning in schizophrenia using behavioral and neural techniques adapted from cognitive neuroscience and vision research. Participants with schizophrenia and healthy controls will perform a perceptual learning task over the course of several days. At the beginning and end of the learning, we will measure the amount of brain activity evoked by stimuli encountered in the training task using electroencephalography (EEG). The first objective of the research will be to determine whether patients show less perceptual learning than controls. The second objective will be to determine whether patients show a different pattern of brain activity changes than controls. The third objective will be to examine how these behavioral and neural measures relate to each other. The research will also explore whether neural changes measured at the beginning of training predict learning outcomes later in training, which would suggest that those early changes are a neural marker of perceptual plasticity. Overall, this perceptual learning-based approach to studying schizophrenia has the potential to lead to new training-based treatments for perceptual abnormalities in the disease, new ways to measure the effects of treatments on perceptual plasticity in schizophrenia, and new insights into the neural basis of the disease."
"9444051","PROJECT SUMMARY Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly lethal malignancy with a five-year survival rate of less than 8%. These grim statistics owe, in part, to the profound resistance of PDA to current therapies. More effective treatment strategies would offer tremendous benefit to PDA patients. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic and genetic heterogeneity exist in both the neoplastic and non-neoplastic compartments of pancreatic tumors, and that this heterogeneity may impact response to treatment. Our own studies have identified two subpopulations of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) present within the PDA microenvironment, a cancer-proximal population that expresses myofibroblast markers and a cancer-distal population that expresses inflammatory markers such as the cytokine IL-6. However, the full complement of cell populations present within the PDA tumors and the mechanisms through which each population might impact tumor biology remain unclear. Tackling these questions requires models that accurately recapitulate human PDA. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid cultures, organoid-stromal co-cultures, and organoid xenografts have emerged as ?next-generation? models that better mimic the complex interactions present in the PDA microenvironment. Yet, the extent to which each model preserves the diverse populations found in human tumors remains unclear. To address this question, we propose to generate a series of matching organoid and xenograft models which we will use to characterize and perturb subpopulations of neoplastic cells and CAFs. We will generate and characterize five sets of paired organoid culture and PDX models, where pairs are derived the same de-identified patient tumor specimens. In addition, we will develop a new model for pancreatic cancer in which patient-derived PDA organoids are delivered to mice in situ via injection into the main pancreatic duct, better recapitulating the developmental trajectory of human PDA than other xenograft approaches. We will use single-cell RNA and DNA sequencing as well as barcoded organoid lines to characterize and perturb the neoplastic and CAF populations present in our models. To study to role of IL-6 in PDA more directly, we will use biochemical and genetic strategies to perturb CAF-mediated IL-6 signalling in our models. Among these, we will make use of a murine model engineered to express human IL-6 as a host for our PDA xenografts, restoring the ability for IL-6 generated in the stroma to signal to the transplanted neoplastic cells. Ultimately, our studies will shed light on the distinct subpopulations of neoplastic cells and CAFs present in the PDA microenvironment and help to identify which of those subpopulations function to promote the aggressive traits characteristic of PDA tumors. The knowledge gained from our studies will provide valuable insights into the nature of the tumor microenvironment. Such insights should inform novel ideas for strategies to effectively treat PDA, a clinical goal with urgent unmet need."
"9438889","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reinforcing properties of addictive drugs result from their effects on the mesolimbic dopamine system, which projects from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens. Dopamine plays a central role in modulating glutamatergic inputs to medium spiny neurons, the major output neuron of the nucleus accumbens. It was recently shown that dopamine neurons release glutamate in the nucleus accumbens, in addition to their canonical release of dopamine. Since glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens is altered in response to chronic exposure to drugs of abuse, it is critical to understand how the release of glutamate from dopamine terminals is regulated. Previous work examining corelease used electrophysiology to measure glutamate- mediated postsynaptic currents and electrochemistry to measure the extracellular concentration of dopamine. However, it is unclear whether the extracellular dopamine measured with electrochemistry is the same pool of dopamine that drives activation of synaptic dopamine receptors. We recently described a new approach to measure synaptic dopamine transmission using overexpression of a G-protein activated inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channel. Since endogenous D2-receptors efficiently couple to these GIRK channels, the outward potassium current can be used as a sensor of D2-receptor activation. Thus for the first time, it will be possible to measure dopamine- and glutamate-mediated postsynaptic currents resulting from simultaneous release of the two transmitters from dopamine terminals. The goal of this proposal is to determine the functional organization of dopamine and glutamate cotransmission in the nucleus accumbens. Aim 1 will examine whether dopamine and glutamate can be stored in separate pools of vesicles by determining whether dopamine- and glutamate-mediated postsynaptic currents are differentially regulated. Aim 2 will assess whether dopamine and glutamate are capable of being stored in the same synaptic vesicles by pharmacologically and genetically manipulating the activity of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters. Technical training in this proposal will inclue learning to record and analyze rapid excitatory postsynaptic currents, learning to perform fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to measure the concentration of extracellular dopamine, learning to combine FSCV with electrophysiology in simultaneous recordings, and continuing to develop skills required to maintain a colony of transgenic mice. Overall, this proposal will test the hypothesis that dopamine and glutamate, while they may be predominantly segregated to different pools of vesicles, can be released from the same synaptic vesicles in dopamine terminals in the nucleus accumbens. This will add to our understanding of how dopamine neurons are capable of transmitting heterogeneous signals to postsynaptic targets."
"9519233","Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem, fibrosing disorder in which vasculopathy, autoimmunity, and inflammation lead to diverse life-altering and life-threatening clinical manifestations. Treatment is typically focused on specific organ involvement and there is no standardized drug to treat the symptoms with significant differences in the therapeutic approaches between experts. Furthermore, the development of new drug is complicated by the heterogeneity of the disease but also by the absence of validated outcome measures. Recent reports have demonstrated that the chronic activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDCs) and subsequent secretion of both IFN-? and the chemokine CXCL4 is associated with the pathogenesis of SSc. Our preliminary data show that pDCs have a key role in promoting skin fibrosis in a mouse model of scleroderma. We also show that the pattern of TLR expression is altered in the pDCs of SSc patients with high expression of TLR8, a receptor that is absent in pDCs from healthy donors or SLE patients. Signaling though TLR8 induced both IFN and CXCL4. Using mice that we have engineered so they bear human TLR8, we show that TLR8 promotes fibrosis as these mice have exacerbated disease. We will test the hypothesis that pDCs is the critical cell type promoting SSc due to the aberrant expression of TLR8 on pDCs that impacts the response to self-nucleic acids in patients. The project will use two separate mouse models of scleroderma to define the role of pDCs, TLRs and key signaling molecules of the TLR pathway such as PI3K? in the development of disease. We will also dissect the underlying defect that leads to the production of CXCL4 in pDCs from SSc patients and will aim to better understand the interplay between CXCL4 and the IFN response following TLR triggering in patients. To tackle these questions, we are proposing to (1) determine what controls pDCs activation in SSc patients and how these cells promote disease and (2) to characterize the nature of TLR8 stimulation of SSc pDCs and evaluate how CXCL4 and IFN impact TLR8 response. We will also determine whether key signaling molecules induced following TLR triggering are involved in disease progression. The data generated here will provide key understanding of the role of pDCs in skin pathology and the factors that control pDCs activation in SSc patients, thus identifying new ways to manipulate these cells in pathological conditions."

The aims of this application are as follows: 1. Implement a third Phase of the SEED study preserving the core study design with enhancements to improve recruitment and a reduction in the data collection protocol in a new Midwestern SEED site. The following aspects of the core study design will be preserved in Phase 3: a) a case-control study design with multiple- source ascertainment of an ASD case group, a non- ASD developmental disability (DD) comparison group and a population-based (POP) comparison group, b) clinical confirmation of developmental status of all participants using a standardized assessment protocol, and c) collection of clinical, genetic and environmental data. Recruitment enhancements will include active follow-up procedures for invited participants. Data collection will be streamlined, compared to Phase 2, primarily by eliminating pediatric and neonatal medical record abstraction for all three participant groups and curtailing data collected for the DD comparison group. 2. Further increase the total SEED pooled sample size to enhance SEED's analytic potential to investigate rare exposures and ASD subtypes by achieving complete data collection on 125 ASD children, 125 DD children and 125 POP children within our site. Reaching these targets at all anticipated Phase 3 sites will increase the total SEED ASD sample to approximately 2000 children which will enhance the examination of rare exposures and modest associations potentially relevant to the etiology of ASD."
"9457213","SUMMARY Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality in the United States. As COPD progresses, patients develop more frequent and severe exacerbations induced by viral and bacterial infections. We have recently reported that cigarette smoke (CS) causes abnormal inflammatory responses in the lungs while also disrupting the circadian molecular clock in lung cells. Our preliminary data suggest that CS-induced cellular senescence and the influenza virus-induced decline in lung function are associated with molecular clock dysfunction in lung epithelial cells. REV-ERB? is a nuclear receptor and critical component of the molecular clock that drives daily rhythms of metabolism and immune- inflammatory responses. We have shown that airway and alveolar REV-ERB? levels are reduced in the lungs of mice with emphysema and in the lungs of COPD patients, and during exacerbations. Further, REV-ERB? agonists reduce CS-induced levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-senescent mediators. These data suggest that, besides its function as part of the molecular clock, REV-ERB? also acts as a critical component of the immune- inflammatory response to CS and may be a key player in the progression and exacerbation of COPD. Despite these intriguing results, the role of REV-ERB? in CS-mediated DNA damage/repair and cellular senescence and its involvement in influenza virus-mediated lung responses is not known. We hypothesize that the CS- mediated reduction in REV-ERB? abundance potentiates lung cellular senescence and inflammatory responses. Further, the loss of circadian protein leads to COPD development, progression, and produces more severe influenza virus-induced exacerbations. We propose to test this hypothesis by determining the mechanistic relationship between the CS-induced reduction of REV-ERB? levels, increased cellular senescence, DNA damage/repair, emphysematous responses and virus-mediated decline in lung function and mucus production in the following three Aims: Aim 1: Determine whether REV-ERB? protects against cellular senescence and senescence-associated inflammatory responses during CS-induced COPD/emphysema; Aim 2: Determine the mechanism whereby the interaction between REV-ERB?, ROR? and HDAC3 regulates CS-induced lung cellular senescence and inflammatory responses; and Aim 3: Determine whether REV-ERB? protects against lung function decline and mucus hypersecretion in a mouse model of influenza virus-mediated COPD exacerbation. This proposal will unravel the role of the nuclear receptor and clock protein REV-ERB? in regulating lung cellular senescence and inflammatory responses during influenza virus-induced COPD/emphysema exacerbations. In turn, this will have great translational potential for the development of novel and potentially effective pharmacological therapies to ameliorate lung cellular senescence in COPD and its exacerbations based on targeting REV-ERB? function in the lungs using a molecular clock based treatment."
"9504758","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  An emerging hallmark of cancer is epigenetic alteration, which often results directly from somatic mutations of  genes  encoding  chromatin  factors  or  secondarily  from  hyperactive  signal  transduction  or  metabolic  changes.  These epigenetic changes in turn render cancer cells highly reliant on the chromatin machinery to maintain the  malignant  state,  thus  creating  opportunities  for  therapeutic  intervention  by  targeting  chromatin.  Histone  post-­ translational modifications (PTMs) carry an epigenetic layer of message that can be recognized and decoded by  dedicated  protein  ?readers?  to  regulate  fundamental  DNA-­templated  processes.  Therefore,  these  recognition  events constitute key mechanisms underlying transcriptional control in cancer. We recently discovered that ENL,  a YEATS domain-­containing protein, acts as a novel reader for histone acetylation to regulate oncogenic gene  expression  and  is  essential  for  the  maintenance  of  a  wide  range  of  aggressive  leukemia.  Structural  study  revealed  an  acetyl-­lysine  binding  pocket  in  the  ENL  YEATS  domain  that  is  amenable  for  drug  targeting.  Furthermore, recurrent mutations in the ENL YEATS domain were recently reported in Wilms tumor, the most  common  kidney  tumor  in  children  and  associated  with  poor  outcome,  indicating  a  broad  and  important  role  of  ENL  in  cancer.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  fully  elucidate  the  mechanisms  by  which  ENL  and  its  tumor-­ associated mutations establish and/or maintain the malignant state in cancer. During the mentored phase of the  award, the PI will apply innovative approaches to identify the combinatory histone codes and DNA-­binding factors  that  determine  the  gene-­specific  targeting  of  ENL  (Aim  1).  The  PI  will  also  identify  and  characterize  effector  proteins that mediate the gene regulatory function of ENL in leukemia (Aim 2). During the independent phase,  the PI proposes to study the roles of tumor-­associated ENL YEATS mutations by testing the hypothesis that the  mutations confer gain of function in chromatin targeting and transcriptional control to drive the development of  Wilms  tumors  (Aim  3).  Together,  results  from  these  studies  will  provide  novel  insights  into  epigenetic  reader-­ mediated processes in cancer and advance the exploration of new therapeutic avenues for the associated cancer.  Under  the  guidance  of  an  exceptional  team  of  mentors,  the  PI  will  acquire  new  training  in  chromatin  chemical  biology, computational epigenomics, and transcription regulation, which will critically contribute to the PI?s career  development  and  put  her  in  a  unique  position  to  apply  integrated  approaches  to  reveal  new  insights  into  the  epigenetic control in cancer. The Rockefeller University and its neighboring institutions provide an outstanding  environment for the PI to carry out the proposed study and to enhance her professional development. The award  will serve as an ideal stepping stone for the PI to transition into an independence faculty position and to obtain  long-­term success in the field of cancer epigenetics. "
"9511902","Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in sub-Saharan Africa are at high risk to suffer from malaria. Other high-risk groups in Africa ? including pregnant women and infants ? are administered intermittent preventive therapy with antimalarials to reduce the burden of malaria, but strategies to do so in SCA children are lacking. Currently, few strategies have been tested, and none with large sample sizes powered on clinically-important outcomes for malaria and SCA. In this project, we propose a three-arm, randomized, active-placebo clinical trial of malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens in children with SCA in Western Kenya. Capitalizing on the clinical trial expertise of the Duke Clinical Research Institute, the global field research footprint of the Duke Global Health Institute, and existing collaborations with Moi University and partners in Western Kenya, we will enroll children with SCA in Homa Bay, Kenya, which is endemic for falciparum malaria. Children will be randomized to either daily Proguanil (current standard of care), monthly sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine-amodiaquine, or monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and followed for 12 months. The primary outcome will be the incidence of falciparum malaria, and other prespecified outcomes compared between allocation arms will be measures of SCA morbidity including painful events, dactylitis, and need for transfusion, measures of malaria severity, and hospitalizations and deaths. At the conclusion of the study, we expect to provide an evidence base for the use of two alternative strategies to protect children with SCA from malaria, and to potentially reduce the morbidity of SCA in malaria-endemic areas in Africa. These data will directly enable clinicians in Africa to improve the care of children with SCA."
"9469054","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adolescence represents a developmental phase where the skeleton is particularly susceptible to damage that can have long-term effects. Alcohol (ethanol) use is highly prevalent among adolescents, where 1 in 17 (~6%) of boys and girls aged 12-17 are estimated to have engaged in binge drinking. Ethanol is a bone toxicant known to generate oxidative stress by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, ethanol decreases circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Chondrocytes are specialized bone cells derived from the mesenchymal lineage that undergo a stepwise differentiation process ? consisting of proliferation, hypertrophy, and apoptosis ? to maintain the growth plate in mammalian long bones through the process of chondrogenesis. This process is influenced to a significant extent by IGF-1, which supports chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy and controls oxidative stress, and a balance of ROS signals generated by the NADPH oxidase enzymes Nox2 and Nox4. Interference with ROS regulation can impair normal growth plate homeostasis and longitudinal growth. Ethanol impairs growth plate maturation, although the precise mechanisms underlying this effect have not been elucidated in vivo. The studies proposed in this application are designed to uncover the mechanistic aspects of ethanol?s effects on the growth plate using an adolescent mouse model (C57Bl6 mice, aged 6 weeks) and chronic ethanol exposure (Lieber-DeCarli diet, 28% ethanol, 10 weeks). The overall hypothesis of these studies is that ethanol reduces IGF-1 signaling and induces multiple sources of intracellular ROS to suppress chondrocyte proliferation, disrupt growth plate formation, and impair longitudinal bone growth. Three specific aims will address complementary aspects of the systemic and intracellular toxicity of ethanol on chondrogenesis. Specific Aim 1 will use intravenous IGF-1 supplementation to determine the extent to which ethanol impairs IGF-1 signaling and suppresses growth plate maturation. Specific Aim 2 will use the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoTEMPO to suppress mitochondrial ROS generation and determine their contribution to ethanol?s ROS-mediated effects. Specific Aim 3 will use separate Cre-lox genotypes that delete Nox2 and Nox4 specifically in chondrocytes to determine the role of each enzyme in ethanol-induced ROS, as well as each enzyme?s respective role in the distinct stages of chondrocyte differentiation. The responses to these experimental conditions will be determined by gene expression (qPCR, RNAscope hybridization), protein biology (western blotting, immunohistochemistry, ELISA), ROS generation (DMPO spin trapping), cellular morphology (histological staining), and overall bone structure. These studies will generate new insights into the role of hormonal factors and ROS in chondrocyte maturation and provide an integrated picture of ethanol?s mechanism of action on growth plate development during an important window of developmental susceptibility."
"9442816","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been extremely successful in identifying numerous risk loci for complex traits and diseases, at the vast majority of these loci, the causal mechanism between genetic variation and disease risk remains largely unknown. This prohibits the development of novel drug targets, personalized treatments or accurate prediction of high-risk individuals. In the quest to address this gap, post-GWAS studies are experiencing a ?big data? revolution driven by the exponentially decreasing costs of high-throughput genomic assays. Multiple layers of data (genetic variation, transcriptome levels, epigenetic modifications, localization of tissue-specific regulatory sites, etc.) are routinely collected in increasingly large cohorts of individuals. This raises the need for new computational and statistical methods that are able to integrate various types of data (genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic) to understand the causal mechanism of disease at GWAS risk loci. Here we propose to develop new methods and techniques and to apply them to gain insights to the genetic basis of common disease and traits. Importantly, we aim to circumvent genomic privacy issues (that often prohibit access to large-scale GWAS data) by proposing techniques that operate directly at the summary statistic level (e.g. variant effect sizes). We will apply existing and newly developed methods on GWAS summary data sets over 30 traits and diseases spanning more than 1,000,000 phenotype measurements, joint with a catalogue of over 7,000 biochemical and evolutionary genetic metrics of functionality as well as over 10,000 individuals for which genetic variation, gene expression and disease status has been measured."
"9618337","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimated >10 million new cases of syphilis occur worldwide every year with ~40% of congenital syphilis cases resulting in fetal loss or perinatal death. Moreover, approximately half of the surviving infants suffer serious sequelae. The successful control of syphilis requires a better understanding of critical virulence factors of Treponema pallidum, the syphilis spirochete, and additional knowledge of the antigenic markers of severe disease is warranted. Based upon our preliminary data, we hypothesize that (1) specific adhesins of T. pallidum are associated with invasion and colonization of placenta, (2) the presence of anti- adhesin maternal antibodies capable of blocking adherence might result in less severe or no congenital infections, and (3) these antigens could serve as vaccine candidates. Testing of this hypothesis will help achieve our long-term goals to understand congenital syphilis pathogenesis and develop effective vaccine. We propose to perform the first comprehensive molecular exploration of the role of three known and putative T. pallidum adhesins in congenital syphilis ex-vivo and in vivo, and to test the association of antibodies against these proteins with the congenital syphilis outcomes. Using a highly novel immunization approach, we will also assess the potential of these antigens as vaccine candidates in the rabbit infection model of syphilis.  Due to the inability to cultivate T. pallidum in vitro, and its genetc intractability, we will employ several innovative approaches to perform our proposed studies. For instance, using a bioluminescent, non-infectious, non-adherent spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi to express T. pallidum genes, we discovered that T. pallidum TP0435 lipoprotein is a placental cell adhesin. We will also examine the role of two other putative placental adhesins, TP0954 and the laminin/fibronectin-binding lipoprotein TP0136. TP0954 exhibits similarity with the var2CSA domain of PfEMP1 of Plasmodium falciparum, which facilitates placental colonization by the malaria parasite causing great harm to the developing fetus. The goals of this project are to: determine the role of T. pallidum adhesins in binding to placental tissue usin a heterologous expression system (Aim 1); determine the impact of the adaptive immune response against syphilis in pregnant women on both placental colonization and on pregnancy outcomes (Aim 2); and determine whether specific adhesins or a combination of adhesins can be used as vaccine to induce protective immunity against syphilis (Aim 3). Significance. This application takes advantage of unique resources: clinical and molecular expertise of Dr. Centurion-Lara on treponemes and access to samples from syphilitic pregnant women in Peru for studying congenital syphilis, coupled with the experimental know-how and proficiency of using rabbit model of syphilis of Dr. Giacani along with the strong expertise of Dr. Parveen in spirochetes-host interactions. This will be the first such all-inclusive study that will enhance th understanding of congenital syphilis and will also lead to development of better diagnostic tools and vaccine strategy against syphilis."
"9447611","PROJECT SUMMARY This is the competitive renewal of our program on MITF, a bHLHzip transcription factor that we have shown to play a master regulatory role in melanocytes. Our accomplishments include the discovery that MITF transcriptionally regulates nearly all known melanocyte-specific mediators of melanin biosynthesis. We linked MITF expression to Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone/MC1R signaling and to post-translational modulation by c-Kit/MAPK, and utilized these insights to molecularly define the UV-tanning pathway. We generated and analyzed red hair/light skin models of carcinogenesis, and discovered an endorphin-mediated behavioral impact of UV irradiation to skin. Our studies identified MITF target genes and biological behaviors that impact skin cancer prevention (through potent pigmentation effects) and oncogenesis (if genomically mutated). In the most recent grant period, we generated abundant data, including discoveries that set the background for the current application. In profiling MITF target genes, we unexpectedly observed MITF occupancy and regulation of the PDL1 gene. This odd connection between MITF and a key ubiquitous immune-tolerance factor was also notable because vitiligo patients are known to exhibit significantly lower-than-expected non-melanoma skin cancer incidence. This led us to consider that PDL1 may exert tolerance for accumulation of UV-induced high- neoantigen burdens, particularly in non-regenerating cells. Beyond extensive molecular analyses, we observed vitiligo-like melanocyte depletion with immune infiltration in UV-irradiated PDL1-deficient mice. This suggests an opportunity to use PD1 suppression for immune clearance of neoantigen-accumulating skin cancer precursors in high-risk individuals?which we will test in preclinical models (Aim 1). We have deeply analyzed red hair/light skin phenotypes, as well as UV-dependent and independent melanoma risk. In mouse models, we observed several cAMP-inducing agents to rescue dark/eumelanin pigmentation and protect against UV carcinogenesis. However, these agents could not topically penetrate human skin sufficiently to affect pigmentation. We now study an alternative target, SIK, whose kinase suppression induces CREB and MITF, as well as pigmentation. Systemic SIK inhibitors are being studied in a variety of diseases, and we found topical administration induces strong eumelanin-darkening in both human and mouse skin. Given potential translation to humans, we will evaluate this for skin cancer prevention using preclinical models (Aim 2), and test its effects for safety on BRAF- or NRAS-induced nevi in mice. Finally, we discovered MITF as a transcriptional repressor of numerous genes involved in neuron or Schwann cell development. Some of these are known to, themselves, antagonize MITF expression. This suggests a mutually repressive developmental ?double-switch? to determine lineage destiny for neural crest derivatives. We will (Aim 3) scrutinize mechanisms underlying MITF's repressive activity, use models to biologically test such lineage switching, and test repressed targets for expression in a low-MITF melanoma subtype (desmoplastic) that is in need of diagnostic markers."
"9475026","SUMMARY ? PROJECT 3. Mechanisms of immunotherapy action. The goal of this project is to collect data and construct computational models that provide a systems-level understanding of the myriad interactions that contribute to immune surveillance of cancer, thereby improving our ability to manipulate these interactions for cancer therapy. We will study the effects of perturbations (genetic and drug-induced) on metabolic and signaling pathways and on anti-tumor T cell function in mouse models. This is expected to significantly increase our understanding of anti-tumor responses by T cells and to generate pre-clinical data needed to design new combination therapies for possible translation into the clinic. We aim for computational models that predict the consequences of therapeutic intervention based on assays of pre-treatment state. Immune-tumor interactions are dependent on the intracellular states of cells, which we will measure at the levels of gene expression, signal transduction and cellular metabolism. Metabolic state affects the ability of immune cells to function in tumor cell killing and immune checkpoint inhibitors alter T cell metabolism. Metabolic enzymes thus represent an emerging class of targets for therapeutics that aim to augment anti-tumor immune responses by blocking or mitigating the effects of T-cell exhaustion. Since cell-non-autonomous mechanisms play a major role in ICI, computational models will focus on interactions among cells, in which data on cell state is modeled as influencing the strength of these interactions. We hypothesize that such models will reveal new ways to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy by combining ICIs, targeted therapies and drugs that modulate the activity of metabolic enzymes. Aim 6.1 Will define cellular and metabolic interactions among immune checkpoint receptors by exposing syngeneic mouse tumor models to antibodies against immune checkpoint receptors individually and in combination, and then measuring the effects on tumor and immune cell states using multiple profiling technologies at single cell resolution. We hope to identify ?exhaustion targets? that might be drugged to increase the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. Aim 6.2 Will study immune signaling networks known to be important in T-cell biology and ICI function and link the activities of these networks to the metabolic states of both tumor and immune cells. Extensive evidence shows that metabolic and signaling states of immune cells are important in tumor surveillance but relatively few parallel studies have been performed linking activity of immune and tumor signaling to metabolism. Aim 6.3 Will investigate the cellular and molecular events underlying successful combination immunotherapy using syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models in which a combination of ICIs, cytokines and a lymph node-targeted vaccine results in regression of well-established tumors. We will also assess whether efficacious responses can be detected in circulating immune cells in the blood, a first step towards developing a convenient response bioassay for use in humans."
"9634473","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite national guidelines for routine administration of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, only 33% of adolescent girls and 7% of adolescent boys in the U.S. currently receive all three recommended doses. Healthcare providers are highly influential in parents' decisions to get their adolescent children HPV vaccine, and yet providers often fail to recommend it. Further, recommendations providers do deliver are often weak. The overall goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a brief training program to improve providers' communication about HPV vaccine. This study will focus specifically on providers in Federally Qualified Health Centers because the low-income and minority adolescents served by these clinics are more likely to suffer from HPV-related cancers later in life. HPV vaccination is, thus, especially important in this setting.         In terms of methods, we will first identify provider communication characteristics associated with HPV vaccine delivery (Aim 1). Using existing data, we will conduct a mixed-methods analysis of 204 audio-recorded medical encounters between providers, adolescent patients, and their parents. We will use findings from this analysis to develop a brief educational intervention for providers practicing in low-resource settings (Aim 2). Informed by social cognitive theory, the training's purpose will be to improve providers' knowledge, skills, and confidence for communicating about HPV vaccine. Finally, we will deliver the training to 16 providers in 4 Federally Qualified Health Centers to investigate the intervention's feasibility (Aim 3). Using audio-recordings of medical encounters and surveys of providers, patients, and parents, we will assess the intervention's ability to improve provider perceptions and recommendation practices as well as its acceptability to providers and families.         The proposed study builds on Dr. Melissa Gilkey's prior work in survey research and program evaluation aimed at identifying and overcoming barriers to HPV vaccination. The candidate's long-term career goal is to translate research into evidence-based cancer prevention programs for adolescents. Her immediate career goals are to gain content knowledge in patient-provider communication, skills in developing behavioral interventions, and expertise in conducting randomized clinical trials to test those interventions. The proposed career development award will enable Dr. Gilkey to grow as an independent investigator by providing focused training as well as protected time for research. The proposed program of research will lay the groundwork for Dr. Gilkey's first R01-level study to establish the effectiveness of communication training for raising coverage of HPV vaccine."
"9481376","Project summary: There are more than 18 million HIV-infected (HIV+) women of childbearing age globally, and lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the critical intervention to support the long-term health of HIV+ women and mothers while reducing risks of sexual and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). HIV Viral load (VL) monitoring is a critical tool to evaluate ART effectiveness and transmission risk and there is a global movement to expand use of VL monitoring. But while there are well-developed guidelines for implementing VL monitoring in non-pregnant adults on ART, there has been little consideration given to pregnant and postpartum women. There is a clear and urgent need for evidence-based recommendations into optimal VL monitoring strategies during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The overall goal of this study is to model the longitudinal VL trajectories of HIV+ women entering antenatal care, and then to use this simulation to determine optimal strategies for timing and frequency of VL monitoring in order to maximise the early detection of viraemia, reduce MTCT risk and minimize costs associated with non-informative VL testing. Specifically, the project will: develop a simulation model of longitudinal VL and associated MTCT risk during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Aim 1); determine the optimal VL monitoring strategies to detect elevated VL and minimise transmission risk (Aim 2); and evaluate how optimal VL monitoring strategies may be adapted to facilitate different interventions (such as enhanced infant antiretroviral prophylaxis for infants of mothers with elevated VL) and different programmatic settings (as the timing of ART initiation in pregnancy and levels of retention of women in ART services varies across countries, for instance). Throughout Aims 2 and 3, health systems costs and budget impact will be evaluated for different VL monitoring strategies. The research will provide the first model for determination of optimal VL monitoring schemes in pregnant and postpartum women and will provide critical information for health systems seeking to implement VL monitoring policies that recognise the special needs of this population, alongside the realities of routine chronic disease monitoring in resource-limited settings. In doing so the project will address the major gap in evidence-based recommendations for VL monitoring in this high-risk population and thus help inform the rapid scale-up of VL monitoring in sub-Saharan Africa."
"9450372","Project Summary/Abstract The process of craniofacial morphogenesis demands the coordinated outgrowth of multiple facial prominences that are initially spatially separated. Underscoring this complex choreography, 1/3 of all human birth defects affect craniofacial development. Specifically, cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P), the most common craniofacial birth abnormality that affects the midface, occurs in 1/500-700 live births. During embryonic development, regulatory genes such as Satb2 and Pbx1 control the dynamics of transcriptional activity, tissue- level patterning, and intercellular signaling to modulate the timing of progenitor proliferation, cell cycle exit, and osteoblast differentiation. Variation in these dynamics underpins both evolutionary variation in midfacial outgrowth and the etiology of craniofacial birth defects. Notably, it has been established that the main variable driving species-specific midfacial length and morphology (prognathism) is the maxillary bone of the upper jaw. Despite the availability of large datasets of regulatory elements generated from mouse, chimp, and human facial tissues and cranial neural crest cells, and despite studies of craniofacial phenotypes in mutant mice, the majority of regulatory networks that control embryonic midfacial outgrowth are still unknown with respect to their spatiotemporal context-dependence during midfacial morphogenesis. This knowledge gap negatively impacts the efforts of human geneticists to identify and map causal mutations associated with human craniofacial pathologies. The goal of these studies is to define the cis-regulatory landscapes underpinning midfacial outgrowth in order to understand how morphogenesis of the craniofacial complex as a whole is coordinated with variation in the growth of specific skeletal elements. This project will employ a vertical gene- centric approach to test the hypothesis that a Satb2/Pbx-dependent regulatory network coordinates morphogenetic cell behaviors and osteoblast differentiation critical for normal maxillary outgrowth. Using available Satb2 and Pbx mutant mice, Aim1a will define the regulatory hierarchy of these genes and their impact on maxillary morphogenesis; Aim1b will establish Satb2/Pbx-dependent genomic networks that drive maxillary outgrowth and differentiation by RNA-Seq assays. Moreover, the hypothesis will be tested that regulatory landscapes of genes critical for craniofacial development show distinct spatiotemporal activity in C57Bl/6J (B6) and PWK/PhJ (PWK) mice, two genetically distinct mouse strains with varying maxillary length. In a parallel genome-wide approach that leverages sequence variation in these two mouse lines Aim2a will produce microCT based morphometry on B6 vs PWK embryonic heads to define their respective maxillary growth trajectories; Aim2b will generate genome-wide annotation of the transcriptional regulatory landscapes in developing skeletal anlagen of mice with different degrees of prognathism by GRO-seq analyses on B6 vs PWK embryonic maxillae. These studies will ultimately define the mechanisms underlying tolerance to morphological variation that separate normal craniofacial development from pathology."

The overall goal of Project 2 is to determine which features of a tumor and its microenvironment make it responsive to ICIs or targeted therapies alone or in combination. We will collect quantitative data at single cell resolution on the identities, states and physical arrangement of tumor, stromal and immune cells and on soluble and ECM components that comprise the tumor microenvironment (TME). This will be accomplished using highly multiplexed fluorescence imaging of standard formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and tumor samples combined with single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA). To provide insight into causal relationships among variables, we will analyze samples collected at different points in time, most commonly biopsies prior to and on therapy, and at the time of drug-resistant disease. In the case of ICI-induced skin toxicities, we will perform localized interventional studies (e.g. treatment with retinoids) followed by biopsies to determine the effectiveness of treatment and to test specific hypotheses about immune cell homeostasis in skin, respectively. Much of the work in this project will be hypothesis generating and will be tightly integrated with hypothesis testing studies in cells and mice in Projects 1 and 3. Aim 5.1 will focus on experimental and computational methods for obtaining 20-60 channel images from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue and tumor samples using tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CycIF). Aim 5.2 will integrate high dimensional t-CycIF imaging and single cell RNA sequencing to generate data on the composition and states of tumor, stromal and immune cells at single-cell resolution (?deep tumor phenotypes?). Aim 5.3 will use deep phenotyping to analyze tumors from BRAFV600E patients treated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors or patients treated with ICIs irrespective of the BRAF mutation status. Biopsies collected before and during therapy, and at the time of progression, will be used to identify changes in the malignant cells, TME and immune cell cohort associated with, and potentially predictive of, therapeutic response and drug resistance. Aim 5.4 will analyze the effects of ICIs on skin-resident T-cells and compare adverse responses to the idiopathic conditions they resemble; analysis of local responses to retinoids and steroids will provide new insight into immune homeostasis in the skin. Aim 5.5 will identify features associated with (and ultimately predictive of) exceptional response to ICIs in brain tumors and provide data on biomarkers that can be evaluated in Bayesian adaptive clinical trials. Aim 5.6 will investigate the connection between immune infiltration and intrinsic or drug-induced genomic instability in triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). Aim 5.7 will integrate data on tumor phenotypes, drug interventions and clinical responses using a range of supervised and unsupervised machine-learning methods, including methods based on network priors, and also link scRNA transcriptomics with t-CycIF image data using a multi-view learning framework."
"9269293","Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, and while decreasing in prevalence in the majority of the developed world, this disease continues to disproportionately affect certain populations in the United States (US). In particular, the rate of ICC incidence and mortality in Appalachian women is the highest in the US. While many risk factors are known to influence ICC development, little is known about the role of hereditary and genetic susceptibility factors. The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B) is a universal critical regulator of various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, via its binding with a receptors complex on the cell surface. Cancer cells frequently avoid the inhibitory influence of TGF-B on cell proliferation via somatic inactivation of key components of the signaling pathway, including the ligand and receptor complex. Additionally, germline polymorphisms in the ligand and receptors have been associated with cancer development and increased cancer susceptibility. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the increased incidence of ICC observed in Appalachian women over their non-Appalachian counterparts is due in part to inherited and somatic alteration of the TGF-B ligand and receptor complex that can be further potentiated in association with various environmental, behavioral, and socioeconomic risk factors. Specifically, we will determine prevalence of inherited polymorphic and somatically acquired variants of key TGF-B pathway components in a large cohort of Appalachian ICC patients compared to healthy Appalachian women. Furthermore, we will determine whether these genetic alterations contribute individually or in combination with other known environmental (Human Papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr Virus), behavioral (smoking), and social (stress, social networks) risk factors, to the increased susceptibility of Appalachian women to ICC  development."
"9431230","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell fate decisions lead to highly reproducible patterns in metazoan development. However, these decisions hinge upon the system overcoming stochastic transcriptional events at the molecular level. The goal of the proposed study is to establish the molecular mechanisms underlying transcription in living fly embryos and to understand the dynamic and stochastic nature of these mechanisms that eventually lead to precise patterns. To gain insights into the regulatory processes that span such vastly differing temporal and spatial scales-molecular transcription events vs. formation of macroscopic patterns-we need to establish a connection between DNA regulatory elements and cell fate decisions in terms of stable transcriptional output, resolved in both time and space. Therefore we will determine a relationship between regulatory DNA elements and transcription activity using quantitative measurements to define a set of parameters characterizing transcription dynamics, such as, e.g., polymerase loading and elongation rates. Such a relationship will give us a link between sequence and fate, and will allow us to formulate quantitative models that lead to predictions that are directly testable in vivo. We propose three approaches that will contribute to the establishment of these structure- function relationships at different and complementary levels: 1) we will dissect the structure of small regulatory enhancers and measure the transcription activity and output in reporter fly constructs. 2) Using genome editing we will measure the endogenous transcription activity of enhancers and combinations of enhancers for specific genes. 3) We will scale up the approach to large numbers of genes in fixed tissue to identify classes of genes according to their dynamic transcription properties. Establishing a quantitative structure-function relationship will ultimately lead us to regulate and re-engineer the transcription programs underlying development and disease processes."
"9506339","Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has a major role in the management of movement disorders, and is under investigation for the treatment of disorders of mood and memory. In Parkinson's disease (PD), DBS of basal ganglia nuclei can improve motor signs and reduce medication-induced motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, characterized by frequent transitions between a hypokinetic state (too little movement) and a hyperkinetic state (too much movement). However, since the introduction of DBS for PD 25 years ago, there have been no major improvements in this therapy. Existing DBS devices deliver ?open loop? stimulation, continuously stimulating their target structures regardless of changes in the brain circuits related to disease expression. Device programming is a labor-intensive process based on ?trial and error? requiring significant clinical expertise, which is a barrier to widespread application. In PD, continuous open-loop stimulation may result in suboptimal control of fluctuating motor signs, stimulation-induced adverse effects, and short battery life. DBS could be significantly improved by delivering ?closed-loop? stimulation, in which stimulation parameters are automatically adjusted based on brain signals that reflect the patient's clinical state. Using both intraoperative and chronic invasive recording techniques, we and others have identified abnormal patterns of oscillatory activity that may provide physiological signatures or ?biomarkers? of hypokinetic and hyperkinetic states in PD. Here, we plan to develop closed-loop DBS algorithms based on these brain signals, using an investigational neural interface (Medtronic Activa RC+S) that can sense and store brain activity as well as delivering DBS. We will determine which brain signals are the most appropriate to optimize DBS therapy and answer critical questions including the site of control signal detection (cortical versus subcortical) and the required complexity of control signals (single frequency power versus cross frequency interactions). Ten PD patients with motor fluctuations and dyskinesia will be implanted bilaterally with Activa RC+S attached to a subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS lead and an electrocorticography (ECoG) lead placed over motor cortex. We will collect ECoG and subcortical local field potential (LFP) recordings to characterize ?personalized? physiological signatures for each subject and prototype stimulation paradigms by data streaming through an external computer in a clinical setting (Aims 1 and 2). We will then embed algorithms in the pulse generator to implement chronic and fully closed-loop DBS in a small double-blinded clinical trial (Aim 3). Motor function will be assessed by wearable automated detectors as well as rating scales from videotapes and self-report instruments. The study will define the technical characteristics required for the design of future DBS devices. ?Self programming? DBS devices offer the potential to simplify the therapy and allow many more patients to receive DBS. As electrophysiological signatures of abnormal circuit function in other disorders are identified, this new generation of closed-loop devices will facilitate the introduction of novel DBS therapies in other brain diseases. ."

This training grant provides the opportunity to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to become an independent researcher by integrating coursework in child health, nutrition, and epidemiologic methods with mentorship in the application of skills to a problem of global significance in the context of professional development. Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide; it occurs disproportionately among children under five years of age. Nutrition adequacy (including iron-rich food) is essential for adequate brain development. Early child (brain) development has short- and long-term effects on health and productivity. Based on the social-ecological model, factors previously identified to impact child development include stunting (child level), maternal education (interpersonal) and home environment (family/household). Although cohort studies have provided compelling evidence supporting an association between iron deficiency and child development, intervention trials have found inconsistent evidence, frequently attributed to methodological limitations. There is therefore a need for further investigations and for understanding mechanisms of the association between iron deficiency and child development. The proposed study seeks to assess the relations between iron deficiency and child development in infants and toddlers. The study aims to examine: 1) whether there is an association between iron deficiency and children's cognitive, motor, and socio-emotional development at enrollment and over 12-month follow-up, 2) whether the relation between iron deficiency and children's development varies by children's stunting, maternal education, and the home environment, and 3) whether the duration of iron deficiency impacts children's development. Regression modeling will be used to assess baseline associations, and linear mixed effects models will be used for longitudinal analyses. The proposed study is unique in the use of standardized and highly controlled methods of iron status (venous blood draw and analysis), child development (standardized tests administered by trained psychologists) to assess the relation between iron deficiency and child development, and collaboration with investigators in a low-income country. This project is in line with NICHD's priority to ?is to advance fundamental and clinical knowledge about maternal health and problems of child development?."
"9416980","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder function depends on cycles of smooth muscle (SM) contraction and relaxation to achieve voiding and storage, respectively. Impairment of the strength or duration of bladder SM contraction characterizes a prevalent but poorly understood clinical condition termed detrusor underactivity (DU). DU is a complex disorder that (i) arises from diverse neuromuscular insults, including chronic bladder outlet obstruction, aging and persistent diabetes; (ii) reduces voiding efficiency and (iii) can lead to significant urologic complications. Irrespective of etiology, the loss of normal bladder contractilty in DU is a serious clinical problem that is not understood in mechanistic terms. Pharmacotherapy for DU is limited, comprising primarily parasympathomimetic agents, which have questionable efficacy and adverse side effects. More effective and tolerable treatment options to restore bladder contractility would represent a major therapeutic advance for patients suffering from DU. However, the goal of successful pharmacologic treatment of DU will only be realized by understanding mechanisms regulating bladder SM contraction and their dysregulation in DU.  We recently identified the detrusor smooth muscle as a major site of expression of neuropilin 2 (Nrp2). Exposure of bladder smooth muscle cells to the neuropilin 2 ligand semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F) evoked profound cytoskeletal changes, accompanied by inhibition of RhoA, decreased myosin light chain phosphorylation, and reduced cytoskeletal stiffness. Consistent with this, forced expression of SEMA3F via adenoviral transduction in vivo led to reduced bladder SM contractility. Conversely, knockout of either Nrp2 or Sema3F in vivo enhanced bladder SM contractility compared to non-deleted controls. New data show that in bladders undergoing decompensation following partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO), Nrp2 deletion restored SM contractility compared to non-deleted controls. Lastly, new analysis of human bladder specimens revealed an inverse correlation between detrusor contractility and NRP2 expression. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the SEMA3F-neuropilin 2 network inhibits bladder SM contractility in vivo and that targeting this axis restores contractile function under conditions of DU. The hypothesis will be tested with the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the mechanisms underlying Sema3F- Nrp2-mediated inhibition of bladder SM contractility. (2) Determine the functional consequences of targeting the Sema3F-Nrp2 axis in a model of pBOO. We will employ novel mouse models of Nrp2- and Sema3F- deficiency, tension testing in muscle strips, biochemical and histological analyses, cystometric evaluation and a physiologically relevant mouse model of bladder outlet obstruction to achieve our objectives. At the end of the project period we expect to have determined the mechanism(s) whereby the Sema3F-Nrp2 axis inhibits smooth muscle contractility, the consequences of Sema3F and Nrp2 perturbation for bladder pathophysiology and how the Sema3F-Nrp2 network may be exploited therapeutically to restore contractility in DU."
"9431240","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective is to determine the pathogenic role of specific epigenetic modifications in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in laminopathies, which encompass a wide range of diseases caused by mutations in LMNA gene, encoding lamin A/C (LMNA). Cardiac involvement is the primary cause of death in a subset that affects striated muscles. It manifests as DCM, conduction defects, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Chromatin state regulates gene expression in a cell type-specific manner. Dynamic chromatin modifications are critical for cardiac development and important for adult heart remodeling. In the mammalian genomes, LMNA interacts with chromatin, in a cell-type specific manner, at ~ 1,100 - 1,400 LMNA-associated domains (LADs). LMNA is implicated in H3K9 trimethylation by SUV39H1 and EHMT2 (G9a), histone deacetylation by HDACs and DNA methylation by DNMTs. LADs, mostly located in the heterochromatin loci, are enriched in H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 repressive and to a lesser extent activation histone marks. Preliminary data show marked epigenetic alterations in the heart of 2-week old Lmna-/- mice, preceding cardiac dysfunction. LMNA and several chromatin marks are differentially expressed in neonatal vs. adult cardiac myocytes (CMs) and in CMs vs. cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Switching on expression of LMNAD300N in neonatal CMs leads to DCM and premature death, while its expression in adult CM induces a mild phenotype, findings in accord with the prominent role of epigenetics in neonatal CMs and parallel the phenotypic effects of Hdac3 deletion. Finally, AAV9 mediated expression of LMNA improves cardiac function and survival. Thus, we posit LMNA has distinct cell-type specific epigenetic functions in neonatal and adult CMs and CFs, which are pathogenic in DCM caused by LMNA mutations. To test this hypothesis, Lmna will be conditionally deleted in neonatal (P3) and adult (P60) CMs and CFs, two common cell types in the heart, using specific Cre deleter mice. Epigenetic basis of both cell type-dependent and -autonomous effects on DCM phenotype will be determined in isolated CMs and CFs by characterizing genome-wide promoter occupancy by specific histone marks, CpG methylation, and the whole transcriptome, prior to and after the onset of cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis (aim 1). In aim 2, epigenetic determinants of differential phenotypic effects upon expression of LMNAD300A, responsible for human DCM, in neonatal and adult CMs will be identified (as in aim 1), along with their induction and reversal upon switching on and off LMNAD300N expression, respectively. In aim 3, prevention and reversal of the epigenetic modifications (as in am 1) and the ensuing DCM will be determined upon AAV9- mediated expression the LMNAWT in the heart of CM-specific and systemic Lmna-/- mice. The findings will provide insight into the role of LMNA in cell type-specific epigenetic regulation of cardiac structure and function, the pathogenic role of the epigenetic modifications in DCM, and set the stage for targeted manipulation of selected epigenetic marks for the precise control, prevention, and reversion of DCM due to LMNA mutations."

"9522969","Chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps (CRSwNP) is a significant health problem in the United States. This disorder, which is often particularly recalcitrant to medical and surgical therapy, is characterized by persistent eosinophilic inflammation of the sinonasal mucosa, with thickened secretions that are frequently colonized with micro-organisms. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie CRSwNP remain poorly understood. The epithelium of nose and sinuses participates actively in host immunity, serving as a barrier and first line of defense against inhaled pathogens and other potential threats. In previous studies, we investigated how sinonasal epithelial cells (SNEC) contribute to CRSwNP through production of innate pro-eosinophilic mediators and by bidirectional communication with other immune cells. Our research using human tissue and mouse models have suggested that SNEC are triggered by epithelial damage to produce mediators that promote eosinophilic inflammation. We hypothesize that this pathway, involving innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), is a normal aspect of healing and repair. Our latest findings suggest that the populations of ILCs and epithelial basal progenitor cells differ in CRSwNP. To test the hypotheses regarding basal cell and ILC interaction, we will initially, in aim 1, examine sinus mucosa from patients with chronic sinus inflammatory disease to define subtypes of basal progenitor cells and explore their innate immune function and pro-eosinophilic mediator expression. We will also employ novel cell culture models to understand the properties of basal cell populations. In aim 2, we will explore type 2 ILCs in CRSwNP and their interaction with basal cell populations, using cell culture models. Finally, in aim 3, we will investigate the innate immune activity of polyp basal cells in a modified cell culture model, and we will utilize genetically-modified mice and nasal inflammation models to explore the role of innate immune regulation of basal cells in healing and persistence of eosinophilic inflammation after injury. These studies will significantly advance current knowledge about CRSwNP and create an opportunity to develop innovative therapies for this debilitating and costly medical condition."
"9460289","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a critical need to develop better measures to assess adjustment to mechanical circulatory support (MCS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) because the impact of this therapy on patients' lives is profound. MCS devices are implanted surgically in patients with advanced heart failure and help the heart pump blood throughout the body. After discharge from the hospital, patients manage and troubleshoot their MCS devices while returning, as best they can, to usual activities of daily living (e.g., home and family responsibilities, work, and recreation). Benefits of MCS include longer survival (as compared to medical management of advanced heart failure), reduced heart failure symptoms, and improved physical function. Device-related complications (including bleeding, infection, device malfunction, and stroke) are risks of MCS implantation. As MCS technology evolves, survival is improving and the risk of adverse events is decreasing. However, future recommendations on the advisability of this expensive technology will depend not only on survivability and the risk of adverse events, but also on other outcomes, such as adjustment to MCS and HRQOL, which are less well defined. Importantly, currently available HRQOL instruments, which are generic or designed for heart failure or other illnesses, do not address many of the issues of concern and unique burdens of MCS on patients' daily lives. Currently, 50,000 to 100,ooo patients are diagnosed with advanced heart failure annually. Given the limited availability of heart transplantation, advanced heart failure patients may be offered MCS as a permanent implant (i.e., destination therapy). We propose to develop an MCS-specific measurement system, which we will refer to as Mechanical Circulatory Support: Adjustment and Quality of Life (MCS A-QOL). Our study design will focus on development and psychometric testing of our MCS A-QOL measurement system and evaluation of our conceptual model, followed by an exploration of usability of our measures (via a mobile app) by patients and providers. With development of a measurement system, our research will advance the field of MCS in patients with advanced heart failure. Use of our valid and responsive MCS A-QOL measures will contribute significantly to more clearly defining the benefits and risks of this evolving technology as compared with medical therapy or other strategies. Thus, survival will become more meaningful, as MCS A-QOL is incorporated into our understanding of risks and benefits."
"9458037","Project Summary While cancer has traditionally been viewed as a disease process based on genetic aberrations, there is increasing evidence that epigenetic alterations play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of many types of cancer. One emerging epigenetic driver of cancer is the super-enhancer, which is defined as a series of traditional enhancers in close physical proximity that determine cell state and cell identity. Super- enhancers define cell state, are associated with genes that control cell type specific biology, and are enriched for disease-associated genetic variation. Super-enhancers identified from cancer cells identify tumor- associated genes in glioblastoma, small cell lung cancer, and multiple myeloma. Because of the close association between super-enhancer structure and biological function, study of the alterations in disease- specific super-enhancers may reveal insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor, with poor responses to all therapeutic modalities despite intensive research. One major contributor to the poor prognosis of glioblastoma is the presence of cancer stem cells. These self-renewing tumor cells play a role in resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, as well as maintenance of tumor heterogeneity and angiogenesis. Because of these features, cancer stem cells have become an important target for the design of novel therapeutic strategies. To better understand key regulators of glioma stem cell identity, an original super-enhancer screen identified genes that are epigenetically upregulated in glioma stem cells and for which elevated expression is associated with poor patient prognosis. This approach revealed lipid metabolism pathways and specifically the gene ELOVL2, which is a lead candidate for further evaluation. Cancer cells utilize aberrant metabolic processes to drive increased proliferation and altered signaling. While lipid metabolism has been implicated in the process of oncogenesis, the precise functions of ELOVL2 have not been defined in cancer. The first aim will define the role of ELOVL2 in glioma cell survival, self-renewal capacity, and tumor formation in both in vitro and in vivo settings. The second aim will investigate the transcription factor network that regulates the expression of ELOVL2 including enhancer elements, transcription factor occupancy, and super-enhancer structure. These approaches will lead to a greater understanding of the epigenetic features that define the glioma stem cell state and inform the development of novel therapeutics."
"9483309","Role of PTEN in Mitosis and Chromosome Stability Project Summary The chromatin environment shapes DNA-based processes and recent studies reveal that the PTEN tumor suppressor con- trols both DNA duplication/segregation and chromatin remodeling. A fundamental question is how PTEN mediates the interplay between the genome and the epigenome to ensure faithful transmission of genetic materials. Our long-term goal is to illuminate the function of PTEN in maintaining mitotic chromosome stability and to understand why this function is a major driving force in tumor suppression. The overall objective of this project is to identify critical regulatory elements in both mitosis-intrinsic machinery and global chromatin architecture that work together under the control of PTEN to promote mitotic fidelity. In support of this goal, our recent studies show that depletion of PTEN results in spindle shorten- ing and pole fragmentation, accompanied by misalignment and non-disjunction of chromosomes, leading to catastrophic mitotic failure and polyploidy. These observations suggest that PTEN is directly involved in mediating the interaction be- tween chromosomes and the mitotic spindle. In addition, metaphase cells lacking PTEN exhibit prominent chromosome entanglement, centromere breakage, and acentric anaphase bridges, indicating structural chromosome instability likely due to impaired chromatin architecture. Interestingly, our published data demonstrate that PTEN regulates histone anchor- age and modification on chromatin and thereby affects the chromatin compaction status. These results collectively support our hypothesis that PTEN maintains structural and numerical chromosome stability by coordinating mitotic chromatin compaction and mitotic spindle assembly for proper chromosome alignment and segregation. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims. In the first aim, we will demonstrate impairment of mitotic chromatin compaction and epi- genetic deregulation of kinetochore assembly as a prevailing phenotypic consequence of PTEN dysfunction. High- resolution imaging and biochemical approaches, in combination with knock-in animal models developed in our laborato- ry, will be used to analyze PTEN function in promoting mitotic chromatin condensation. In the second aim, we will delin- eate the mechanism underlying the functional interaction among interrelated PTEN pathways in governing spindle activity and chromosome behavior. Using a comprehensive set of cellular and molecular biology approaches, coupled with newly generated transgenic mouse strains, we will depict a PTEN-associated mitotic signaling network comprised of both struc- tural and functional regulatory elements that act in concert to guard the genome. Successful completion of these aims will fundamentally advance our mechanistic understanding of the multifaceted function of PTEN in mitosis and chromosome stability. Data from our studies will illustrate how PTEN deficiency triggers a deteriorative interaction between deregulat- ed mitotic machinery and unfavorable chromatin milieus, leading to structural and numerical chromosome aberrations. Newly discovered mitotic pathways and targets in this innovative project will contribute to precision medicine through tailoring targeted therapies based on the genetic and epigenetic signatures of each cancer patient."
"9431175","?    DESCRIPTION: Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV) are showing promising clinical results in a few diseases including hemophilia B, hereditary blindness and lipoprotein lipase deficiency. Even with the early limited success in treating simple disease entities, there are a number of limitations with the current vectors. For example, in the hemophilia B trials, AAV8-hFIX transduced patient livers after IV infusion and an improvement in the bleeding diathesis was demonstrated, yet the following difficulties remain: 1) some patients develop a transient transaminitis thought to be due to a T-cell response directed against AAV8 capsids; 2) transgene expression based on vector dose per body mass is far less than predicted from mouse studies (~10x) and non- human primate studies (~3-5x), suggesting transduction in human hepatocytes is not optimal; 3) pre-existing neutralizing anti-AAV8 antibodies are found in about 1/3 of patients; 4) re-administration of a different vector maybe required; 5) a limitation i the size of AAV genome packaging makes it difficult or even impossible to treat other similar diseases (e.g. hemophilia A, the more common form of hemophilia). Due to the fact that significant differences in rAAV transduction are dictated by small variations in capsid amino acid sequences, we have pursued molecular shuffling of capsid genes to create AAV libraries with extensive sequence variants (~10e7). These novel capsids replace the wild-type capsid in a viral plasmid and are used to produce infectious virus in the presence of a helper virus. Replicating AAV is grown under selective conditions that we vary according to the desired outcome, and those with a selective advantage are isolated and their sequences determined. These capsids can then be used to package therapeutic genes and their transduction determined. We and others have selected AAV capsids with new properties, many of which have become very useful to the gene therapy community. However, we feel the full utility of replicating capsid libraries has yet to be reached. We plan to assemble new more complex libraries and select for enriched capsids after serial passage in primary human hepatocytes maintained in a chimeric mouse-human liver model under different selection pressures. We will make vectors from the most selected capsids and study their transduction in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we will use these libraries in two high-risk, high-payoff screens: 1) select capsids with novel cell specificity (e.g. an AAV that only transduces hepatocytes infected with hepatitis- C virus); 2) select capsids that can package larger genomes, thus expanding the utility of AAV vectors for diseases whose expression cassette just exceeds current packaging limits (e.g. cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia A,). We believe this work will not only provide new AAV vectors for expanded use in research and clinical gene therapy, but will also provide important quantitative guidelines to make AAV capsid shuffling more efficient for all groups pursuing this line of research."
"9438562","ABSTRACT     Abnormal  separation  of  the  respiratory  system  from  the  foregut  leads  to  the  common  birth  defect  esophageal  atresia/tracheoesophageal  fistula  (EA/TEF)  which  affects  1/2,500-­3000  newborns.  Although  the  anomaly can be corrected with surgical intervention, up to 72% of surviving adolescents and adults continue to  suffer from respiratory problems throughout their lifetime, suggesting a connection between EA/TEF and lung  abnormalities.  Consistently,  EA/TEF  is  always  accompanied  by  abnormal  lungs  (e.g.  lobe  fusion)  in  animal  models, although the underlying mechanism is unknown. We recently showed that an epithelial saddle formed  at the lung-­esophageal boundary moves upward to split the lung and trachea from the esophagus. However,  several important questions remain to be answered. How is the lung involved in saddle formation and movement?  What is the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism? We aim to use a combination of organ culture, frog,  and  mouse  models  to  address  these  issues.  Our  lineage  tracing  data  show  that  derivatives  of  respiratory  progenitor cells (Nkx2.1 positive) integrate into the esophagus during separation. Moreover, our preliminary data  suggest  that  a  unique  lung  epithelial  progenitor  subpopulation  (Sox2;?Sox9;?Isl1  positive)  located  at  the  lung-­ esophageal  boundary  plays  critical  roles  in  the  formation  of  the  saddle.  We  further  found  that  the  loss  of  the  transcription  factor  Sox2  or  Isl1  in  the  lung  progenitors,  including  the  subpopulation,  leads  to  EA/TEF  and  abnormal  lungs  in  both  frogs  and  mice.  Interestingly,  these  abnormalities  are  accompanied  by  a  reduction  of  extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins including Fras family members Fras1 and Frem2 which are known to regulate  lung  development.  We  therefore  hypothesize  that  the  Sox2/Isl1  axis  regulates  ECM  proteins  in  a  lung  epithelial progenitor subpopulation (Sox2;?Sox9;?Isl1 positive) that is required for respiratory-­esophageal  separation and lung development. We will test the hypothesis with three specific aims: Aim1 to determine the  contribution of the lung epithelial progenitor subpopulation to the saddle formation and respiratory-­esophageal  separation;? Aim2 to test the hypothesis that Sox2 regulates Isl1 in the lung epithelial progenitor subpopulation  to  control  respiratory-­esophageal  separation;?  Aim3  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  Isl1  regulates  the  separation  process  and  lung  development  through  ECM  proteins.  Notably,  chromosomal  deletion  of  the  region  covering  ISL1  (and  other  genes)  has  been  found  in  patients  with  EA/TEF.  Our  findings  therefore  will  provide  direct  evidence  and  mechanistic  insight  into  the  role  of  Sox2/Isl1/ECM  axis  in  the  pathogenesis  of  this  defect  and  associated lung abnormalities.   "
"9618915","Abstract While coordinated activities of the sympathetic and neuroendocrine systems are essential for proper maintenance of cardiovascular (CV) homeostasis, sustained sympathohumoral activation is highly detrimental, contributing to CV disorders including hypertension. Thus, elucidating mechanisms regulating sympathohumoral activation is critical for the prevention and more efficient treatment of hypertension. The hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) nucleus plays pivotal roles in the generation of sympathohumoral responses. Neuronal activity within this nucleus is controlled by a balance between intrinsic properties and extrinsic synaptic inputs. In recent studies, we showed that the A-type K+ current (IA) inhibits PVN firing activity, and that blunted IA function contributes to enhanced neuronal activity in hypertension. Another major pathogenic factor in hypertension is increased glutamate NMDA receptor function. However, whether these two distinct mechanisms are functionally and causally coupled, is at present unknown. Using a multidisciplinary approach combining in vitro and in vivo studies, we obtained exciting preliminary data supporting a causal link between extrasynaptic NMDARs and IA in mediating increased neuronal activity and sympathoumoral activation in hypertension. Moreover we found astrocytes to be pivotal players influencing the efficacy of the eNMDAR-IA coupling. In this proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that over-activation of eNMDARs and its negative coupling to IA is a major contributing factor underlying increased neuronal activity and sympathohumoral activation in hypertension. The main objective of this application is to characterize the signaling mechanisms underlying the eNMDAR-IA coupling. Moreover, we aim to elucidate the relative contribution of (a) altered glial function and (b) intrinsic neuronal mechanisms to overactivation of the eNMDAR-IA coupling, and increased neuronal activity and sympathohumoral activation in hypertensive rats. Using a renovascular hypertensive animal model, we propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1- To characterize the functional coupling between eNMDARs and IA; Aim 2- To determine if altered glial function contributes to enhanced eNMDAR-IA coupling in hypertensive rats; and Aim 3- To determine if altered neuronal mechanisms contribute to enhanced eNMDAR-IA coupling in hypertensive rats. We expect this work to expand our knowledge on basic neurobiological principles implicated in the generation of homeostatic neurohumoral responses. More importantly, we expect to identify key pathophysiological brain mechanisms contributing to maldaptive neurohumoral responses in hypertension. We hope our work will help in the development of novel and more efficient therapeutic strategies for the treatment of hypertensive conditions."
"9462186","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity plays an adverse role at every stage of conception and pregnancy and mounting evidence implicates relative hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and reduced menstrual cycle hormone secretion as likely contributors to the subfertility phenotype and possible contributors to complications of pregnancy and the developmental origin of adult diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We and others have documented reduced LH, FSH, estradiol and estradiol metabolites and progesterone and progesterone metabolites in obese women compared to those of normal weight. This relative hypogonadotropic hypogonadism partially reverses with surgical weight loss. More recently, we have identified the pituitary gland as a site of defective reproductive axi function in obesity. Our prelminary findings indicate that we can induce deficits in pituitary production of LH and FSH in normal weight women similar to those we have observed in obese women by acutely infusing free fatty acids and insulin (but not either agent alone). The experiments proposed are designed to test the hypothesis that combined excess of free fatty acids and insulin, as typically occurs in obesity, will, at least in part, recapitulate the reprodutive phenotype of obesity in normal weight women (NWW). We have named this phenotype the `reprometabolic syndrome'. Specific Aim 1 predicts that a high- fidelity model of the reprometabolic syndrome can be reliably recreated in normal weight women using a combination of insulin and fatty acid infusion over the short term, and long-term if they are given a eucaloric, high fat diet (HFD) for one month. Reproductive hormones will be assessed before and after acute lipid and insulin infusion or up to one month of HFD feeding. Aim 2 will quantify how induction of insulin resistance contributes to the reprometabolic syndrome by examining glucose uptake and lipolysis during a two-stage euglycemic insulin clamp administered before and after the HFD intervention and linking the reproductive hormone changes to the specific actions of insulin. Aim 3 will determine key changes in inflammatory markers induced along with the reprometabolic syndrome to identify potential mediators of the insulin and lipid related pituitary suppression seen in simple obesity."
"9543611","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or PDAC is a lethal disease with a 5 year mortality rate of ~93% and little improvement has been made despite the emergence of several targeted, selective agents. Therefore, a new approach is needed. We will pursue transcriptomic-guided combination therapy as well as targets that are upstream of several signaling pathways, thereby affecting multiple downstream cellular processes and potential resistance mechanisms. Redox factor-1 (Ref-1) is one such protein, as Ref-1 regulates multiple transcriptional factors (TFs) that are critical to pancreatic cancer survival and drug resistance. In the previous funding period, we have advanced APX3330, a Ref-1 inhibitor and the first drug targeting Ref-1 to cancer clinical trials (IND 125360) as a novel, oral, first-in-class drug in humans. We have shown that APX3330 reduces tumor growth in several models of PDAC as a single agent and potentiates gemcitabine-mediated inhibition of cell growth. The mechanism of action of APX3330 has been extensively investigated and characterized by our team. Through inhibition of Ref-1, the activity of STAT3, AP-1, NFkB, and HIF-1? can be blocked leading to a decrease in survival protein expression and response to hypoxia. Recognizing that combination therapy will be necessary in PDAC, we propose to utilize transcriptomic data to identify FDA-approved agents that are likely to synergize with APX3330. Drug synthetic lethality is defined as combination therapy of molecular targets whose dual inhibition leads to potentiation of cell death much more dramatically than when administered as single agents. Single cell RNA-seq data identified HIF-1 signaling pathways as significantly down-regulated following Ref-1 knockdown (p=0.0008). Therefore, we tested the combination of Ref-1 inhibition and HIF-1 target, carbonic anhydrase (CA9) in our 3-Dimensional (3D) tumor co-culture model. Dramatic enhancement of Ref-1-induced cell killing is observed upon dual-targeting of Ref-1 and CA9. Our hypothesis is that in order to extend the survival of PDAC patients multi-targeted, combination therapy is essential; therefore we will use original, pathway-driven screening approaches to discover appropriate FDA approved agents to partner with our Ref-1 inhibitor. AIM 1- Evaluate the mechanism and efficacy of simultaneous inhibition of the Ref-1 and HIF-1? pathways using in vivo models of PDAC. AIM 2- Investigate the role of Ref-1 in sensitizing PDAC to chemotherapy currently used in PDAC treatment. Gemcitabine (Gem), one of the agents that single cell RNA-seq expression profiling predicted should work with APX3330, will be used in combination with APX3330 in the phase 1B trial. AIM 3- Screen for drug synthetic lethal hits following Ref-1 inhibition in a validated 3D model system utilizing computational and transcriptomics pathway analysis. Selective disruption of individual molecular effectors has clear limitations; our approach focuses on multi-targeted combination treatments. Thus, this project has the potential to extend pancreatic cancer survival by using appropriate disease-relevant models such as 3D co-culture spheroids, orthotopic, and GEM models."
"9435125","ABSTRACT The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the separate effects of corneal stiffness and intraocular pressure (IOP) on corneal deformation characteristics under an applied air pulse. Paired human donor eyes (n=60 pairs; 120 eyes) will be used to allow both IOP and corneal stiffness to be varied in a systematic fashion with one eye of the pair treated with a corneal stiffening procedure, and the fellow eye serving as control, combined with 4 levels of IOP from 10 to 40 mmHg in 10mmHg increments. Stiffness will be modified using incremental changes in gluteraldehyde concentration to generate two stiffness groups. Deformation characteristics will be measured in a series of 140 images captured during a ~30ms air pulse with the CorVis ST, a new device with a high speed speed camera (>4,300 frames/sec) aligned with the horizontal meridian of the cornea using Scheimpflug geometry. ANOVA will be used to determine differences in the 3x4 matrix of data, as well as stepwise regression to determine predictors of IOP and level of stiffness based on deformation parameters including a novel stiffness parameter. A clinical investigation of deformation response in keratoconus (n=50), glaucoma (n=50), ocular hypertension (n=50), diabetes (n=50), and normal individuals (n=200) will be conducted with evaluation of novel stiffness parameter. Expected results include the creation of a comprehensive database of ex vivo and in vivo corneal deformation response parameters as a function of IOP, corneal stiffness parameter, and in vivo ocular disease."
"9398115","Lack of physical activity is central to numerous health problems. Despite this, we have limited understanding of the molecular components which confer the benefit of physical activity and their diverse impacts across tissues with respect to age, sex, genetics, environment and other objective physiologic, morphometric, and metabolic measures. Identifying these molecular signatures offers to provide new opportunities for treatment and therapeutics. The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity in Humans Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to assemble a comprehensive map of the molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity and, when possible, relate these changes to the benefits of physical activity. This map will be greatly facilitated by the application of ?omics technologies to identify exercise-responsive genes and to relate their benefits across multiple tissues and contexts. We propose to aid in the construction of this map as the Stanford/Salk MoTrPAC Genome, Epigenome and Transcriptome (GET) Chemical Analysis Center. We will leverage our production and analysis experience to engage in MoTrPAC study design, enable the production of high quality and low cost genomes, epigenomes and transcriptomes and facilitate and engage in bioinformatics analysis with the MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center. Key activities will include coordination and collaboration with all the MoTrPAC sites from tissue management to data delivery. Through these activities we will sequence 3000 genomes and at least 40000 epigenomes and 40000 transcriptomes for samples collected at MoTrPAC animal and human study sites. Our site will engage in multiple levels of quality control from tissue collection to sequence mapping. Generated data in common data formats will be immediately available to MoTrPAC investigators and the Bioinformatics Center through the Google Cloud. In addition, as part of our proposed site, and in coordination with both the MoTrPAC Steering Committee and investigators, we will leverage our expertise in both studies of exosomes and chromatin accessibility sequencing with ATAC-seq to conduct two early pilots that aim to elucidate the systemic and molecular changes in response to physical activity. Additional features of our proposed site are analytical opportunities that include leveraging multiple exercise-related ?omics data sets, such as the DGN study where we have genetic data, transcriptomes and exercise activity recorded for 922 people and have already identified multiple differentially expressed genes and gene-by-environment variants in response to exercise, and diverse and novel -omics methods for gene-by-environment, multi-omics and longitudinal data analysis. Our expectation is that this combination of production experience, exercise-relevant data and novel methods will support diverse and impact research outcomes in the MoTrPAC."
"9454545","Project Summary/Abstract: Facilitating completeness in children?s maltreatment disclosures  Child maltreatment is one of the most serious threats to children?s well-being. However, substantial percentages of children either fail to disclose abuse or provide unconvincing disclosures. In order to justify legal intervention, decision-makers expect children to disclose abuse without excessive prompting, but also to provide sufficient details about time, number, and physical interactions to convince adults that abuse occurred. Interviewers are unsure how to elicit such details; children appear unlikely to produce them spontaneously, but extensive questioning risks error and miscommunication. Given the critical importance of maltreated children?s disclosure for the protection of children, it is imperative to identify the most sensitive interviewing approaches. The proposed program of research will involve a series of novel laboratory and field studies designed to identify interviewing methods that help maltreated children provide complete reports. The project has two aims: 1) To maximize children?s capacity and willingness to disclose adult transgressions; and 2) To identify optimal question types for eliciting details about time, number, and physical interactions. The aims will be achieved through five projects. Project 1 will identify and assess field methods for eliciting maltreatment disclosures and details about time, number, and physical interactions. It will involve detailed analysis of trial testimonies and forensic interviews with children. Project 2 will test the efficacy of novel interviewing methods in eliciting transgression disclosures, and Project 3 will identify optimal question types for eliciting details about time, number, and physical interactions. Projects 2 and 3 will involve laboratory experimental studies with children who are questioned about suspected transgressions. Valenced questions (questions about ?something bad? or ?the worst thing?), paired yes/no questions (yes/no questions followed by a requests for elaboration), and open- ended questions about time, number, and physical interactions will be assessed for their effect on the completeness of children?s disclosures. Project 4 will experimentally assess adults? perceptions of children?s disclosures and denials of transgressions. It will involve laboratory experimental studies with adults asked for their evaluation of children questioned utilizing the techniques tested in Projects 2 and 3. Project 5 will test the efficacy of novel interviewing methods in field experiments with children disclosing sexual and physical abuse. In addition to the techniques described above, it will test the efficacy of conversation questions (questions about the child?s conversations with the suspect), the subject of our currently funded research. Our research program is unique: it combines field observational research, laboratory experimental research, and field experimental research in an attempt to identify the most successful child interviewing approaches. The research provides an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of child development and provide critical insight into best practice for professionals who interview children. It promises to improve interviewing, and in turn to enable child professionals to better protect children and their families."
"9490466","The Vanderbilt-Meharry Translational Nexus is a fully interdisciplinary, translational research training program invigorated by group activities that intentionally mix clinical and non-clinical trainees across disciplines and levels of training for the explicit purpose of connecting, enlarging, and sustaining our community of translational scientists. This new model is responsive to the IOM report calling for changes in how we should train the next generation of researchers to drive translation endeavors and to excel in team science. Unlike traditional T32s our selection of trainees is not constrained by discipline, graduate program, or disease focus, and we incorporate experiences to foster emergence of interdisciplinary teams during training. We draw on our extremely successful programs for K awardees, whose training differs significantly from typical T32 programs, to introduce resources like interdisciplinary mentor panels, work-in-progress sessions, Translational Rounds, peer mentoring groups, writing workshops, and pragmatic career development seminars that intentionally mix scientific themes and tiers of trainees. Set in a uniquely collaborative culture with strong leadership, this program will serve 12 TL1 trainees: five pre-doctoral and five postdoctoral trainees, for up to five and three years of support respectively, and two medical student scholars for one-year research intensives (no prior research experience required). For this program we are introducing Pathways to individualize training trajectories. In addition to conducting mentored research as part of an established transdisciplinary team and pursuing their academic course of studies if applicable, trainees will craft Pathways that combine 42 contact hours (not credits) of didactic, intensive, and experiential learning in one of six areas including: Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Data Sciences, Measurement Methods, Clinical Context (for non-clinical trainees), Technology Transfer and Innovation, and Community Engagement. Components of pathways build key translational competencies, yet are flexible and allow extensive individual tailoring to best match prior training and future career directions of the trainee. This program will benefit from coordination by a CTSA Hub in a medical center that ranks 10th in overall NIH funding; values and achieves diversity, has substantial research, education, and program evaluation infrastructure; desires synergy across TL1 and KL2 proposals; collaborates well with other CTSA sites, and provides trainees access to an abundance of research cores and unique models for expert guidance and consultation like Studios, Biostatistics Clinics, REDCap Data Management Clinics; a library of funded grants, internal study sections, and much more. Combined, this program carefully fosters excellence to inspire careers dedicated to interdisciplinary translational science and prepare future leaders of high performing scientific teams."

"9620358","Project summary/Abstract  Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that regulates energy homeostasis, mitochondrial bioenergetics and mediates exercise-induced neurogenesis in the brain. Both BDNF and its receptor Tropomyosin related kinase receptor B (TrkB) are present in the myocardium. However, the role of BDNF/TrkB signaling in myocardial physiology and the myocardial response to pathological stress is largely unknown. My recent first author publication in PNAS found that constitutive myocardial BDNF/TrkB signaling is required for normal cardiac contraction and relaxation. In new preliminary data, we found exercise induced BDNF expression in the heart, whereas BDNF expression was decreased in myocardium from human heart failure patients and mouse heart failure models. The mice with transgenic myocardial BDNF over-expression showed preserved cardiac function against pressure overload induced by transaortic constriction (TAC). Conversely, cardiac specific TrkB-/- mice (cTrkB-/-) displayed accelerated heart failure progression under pressure overload. Moreover, a small molecule TrkB agonist prevented progression of heart failure in mice, suggesting the BDNF/TrkB pathway could be a novel therapeutic target. Importantly, we found the expression of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1?), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial respiratory function, was decreased in pressure overload in mice, while over- expression of BDNF restored the impaired PGC1? expression in the stressed hearts. In addition, we also found that the expression of myofibrillar isoform of creatine kinase (CK) was decreased in myocardium after TAC, and recovered in cBDNF-tg mice. CK plays a critical role in energy reservation by ATP regeneration through conversion of creatine phosphate (pCr) and ADP. Thus I will test the hypothesis that BDNF/TrkB activation is critical for exercise physiology and protects against pathological stress by improving cardiac bio-energetics, via PGC1? dependent mitochondrial function enhancement and CK mediated ATP regeneration. This hypothesis will be addressed in three specific aims leveraging our novel transgenic mice models: 1) Determine the importance of myocardial BDNF/TrkB on exercise capacity and exercise induced adaptive response; 2) Test whether myocardial BDNF/TrkB signaling protects against pressure overload by activating PGC1?; 3) Test whether myocardial BDNF/TrkB signaling protects against pressure overload by augmenting creatine kinase mediated ATP regeneration"
"9616715","SUMMARY The proposed supplement funds participation of a 3-member team from Elf Zone, Inc. in the I-Corps? at NIH training program. The team will receive training in commercialization that will facilitate the successful development of a research discovery to a commercially available therapy for the treatment of high-risk pediatric and adult leukemia. It will also serve to extend the national innovation ecosystem to the team members? respective academic institutions and companies. The Project: Current standard of care treatments show poor efficacy against B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with overexpression of the cytokine receptor, CRLF2 (CRLF2 B-ALL). Using a cell-mediated delivery system, the Principal Investigator?s (PI?s) laboratory at Loma Linda University (LLU) identified a cytokine that essentially eliminates CRLF2 B-ALL cells in vivo in preclinical patient-derived xenograft models of CRLF2 B-ALL. A recombinant form of the cytokine is proposed as a novel biologic to treat CRLF2 B-ALL. LLU filed a provisional patent application (April 2017) covering the use of the cytokine as a biologic to treat CRLF2 B-ALL. Elf Zone, Inc. has secured an option to license exclusively this technology from LLU. The use of this biologic is anticipated to be in combination with standard of care therapy. Current therapies used to augment standard of care therapy to treat high-risk leukemia, like CRLF2 B-ALL, typically cost $400,000-$800,000 per case. In the United States alone, there is a total of ~2012 new cases per year of CRLF2 B-ALL with larger numbers in Central and South America due to the five-fold increased incidence in the Hispanic population. The Team: The three team members selected for participation in I-Corps? have a demonstrated history of successful scientific collaboration as evidenced by co-authored publication. The team brings the C-level decision making ability, technical expertise, and industry expertise that will allow us to leverage I-Corps? training to commercialize the results of our research discoveries to benefit patients. Kimberly Payne, PhD. Dr. Payne is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Elf Zone, Inc. and owns 60% of the company. She is an Associate Professor at LLU and serves as the university PI for the parent SBIR. The therapeutic activity of the cytokine biologic was discovered in her laboratory at LLU. Dr. Payne brings C-level decision-making ability to the team. Jacqueline S. Coats, BS, MPH candidate. Ms. Coats serves as the Chief Scientific Officer (CFO) of Elf Zone, Inc., and led the patient-derived xenograft studies that identified the therapeutic activity of the cytokine biologic in Dr. Payne?s LLU laboratory. She brings scientific expertise to the team. Ben Van Handel, PhD. Dr. Van Handel has co-founded two start-up companies and is currently the CEO of a company that is developing small inhibitors to modulate cytokine signaling. He has overseen company formation, licensing of technology from UCLA, developing management and advisory teams and successful seed funding. He brings industry expertise to the team. Each member of the team is committed to the time requirements of the program."
"9452029","The overall objective of the proposed research is to utilize a newly discovered, active transendothelial transport pathway, the caveolae pumping system, in order to provide an effective solution to the delivery and toxicity problem of Pt(II)-based chemotherapeutics in breast cancer. Systemic chemotherapy is one of the common forms of breast cancer treatments, however clinical efficacy of Pt(II) antitumor drugs is limited by the significant in vivo barriers inhibit delivery of these drugs into solid tumors, requiring the use of high doses, producing serious side effects and facilitating development of drug resistance. In order to address these problems and significantly improve treatment of breast cancer we propose two novel paradigms: 1) our newly discovered endothelial cell (EC) caveolae targeting system to sidestep passive delivery and dramatically enhance speed and efficiency of tumor penetration, and 2) to design and develop novel platinum(II) supramolecular coordination complexes (Pt(II)-SCCs), the nanoparticles (NPs) that have shown remarkable efficacy in tumor destruction in preclinical breast cancer models while being monodisperse, stable and well-characterized. Our main hypothesis is that immunoconjugates that fully utilize the advantages of caveolae-targeting antibodies will increase Pt(II)-SCCs delivery into tumors for enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity, potentially resulting in a fundamentally new class of anticancer therapeutics. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we plan to design and synthesize Pt(II)-SCC immunoconjugates. In this Aim will also design, synthesize and characterize the chemical identity, purity and physicochemical properties of our Pt(II)-SCCs immunoconjugates. We will use caveolae-targeted antibody which we have shown can move the attached cargo from the blood across the EC barrier into solid tumor with unprecedented speed and specificity. In Aim 2 we will characterize in vivo delivery of Pt(II)-SCC immunoconjugates targeting the EC caveolae in tumors. We will perform dynamic monitoring of antibody-Pt(II)-SCC targeting in real time in live mice with intravital microscopy (IVM) using fluorescence emission of the assembled SCCs. In Aim 3 we will assess the therapeutic efficacy of the EC-targeting Pt(II)-SCC immunoconjugates. The efficacy of our targeted delivery system will be examined in IVM models using fluorescence microscopy and in non-IVM Her2/Neu tumor models with whole-body animal imaging. The long-term goal of this project is to translate our key basic discoveries into an innovative drug delivery platform in order to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity in the breast cancer treatment."
"9441675","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary mission of the North American Fetal Therapy Network (NAFTNet) is to provide a cooperative clinical research network to study the natural history of fetal diseases and to develop therapeutic prenatal interventions to improve outcomes. NAFTNet is a voluntary association of medical centers in the United States and Canada with established expertise in fetal surgery and other forms of multidisciplinary care for complex disorders of the fetus. The network was created to address issues pertaining to fetal therapy that arose from the NIH workshop held on August 16-17, 2004, Fetal Treatment: Needs Assessment and Future Directions, which was supported by the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the Office of Rare Diseases and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. It was recommended that a cooperative group of investigators and clinicians be formed to help set a national agenda for research, clinical progress, and ethical issues in the field. Further, it was recognized that the development of such a group would be a challenge due to the innovative and entrepreneurial nature of fetal therapy. Participants at the workshop from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of North Carolina, Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the University of San Francisco moved forward during the following year to develop the organizational structure of NAFTNet with the primary mission to create a collaborative clinical research network to study the natural history of fetal disease and develop therapeutic prenatal interventions to improve outcomes. Since the initial introductory meeting and invitation to participate in October of 2005, NAFTNet has grown from 18 to 23 major North American fetal therapy units. Participating centers have agreed to (1) a peer- review and mentoring process of submission of research protocols (2) participation and support of NAFTNet approved protocols and (3) institutional financial support. The peer-review process is coordinated in the scientific meetings with a free exchange and dissemination of ideas amongst individuals from the participating centers who are authorities in the areas of fetal diagnosis and treatment and ad hoc members representing the specialties of medical ethics and biostatistics. NAFTNet is a 501c3 organization that seeks to achieve appropriate representation of women and racial/ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities."
"9469692","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT MYC is one of the most important human oncoproteins, contributing to the deaths of an estimated 100,000 Americans each year. The pro-tumorigenic actions of MYC stem from its function as a sequence-specific transcription factor, binding DNA to regulate transcription of thousands of genes connected to ectopic cell growth and proliferation, metastasis, and genome instability. Decades of research into how MYC recognizes its cognate DNA binding sites in the context of chromatin have revealed that, in addition to DNA sequence, there is a strong epigenetic signature for MYC genomic binding sites, marked by methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) and unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. Precisely how these epigenetic marks function to direct MYC to chromatin, however, is unknown. The long term objectives of my work are to understand the molecular mechanisms through which epigenetic determinants contribute to target gene selection by MYC, centering on the recently discovered role of WDR5 as a co-factor for chromatin binding by and tumorigenesis by MYC. WDR5 interacts directly with MYC, co-localizes extensively with MYC across the genome, and is dispensable for DNA-binding by MYC but essential for target gene recognition in the context of chromatin. In association with other proteins, WDR5 has connections to both histone H3K4 methylation and recognition of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, raising the possibility that WDR5 functions as part of a molecular complex that interprets the epigenetic signature for target gene binding by MYC in vivo. The precise objectives of this work are two-fold. First, to define the molecular context in which MYC and WDR5 associate, using a combination of biochemical and comparative genomic approaches to identify components of the MYC?WDR5 complex and determine their genome-wide interactions on chromatin. Second, to use genome-editing and genome-engineering techniques to manipulate the individual proteins and DNA sequences to directly evaluate their role in the recruitment of MYC and WDR5 to chromatin. Together these Aims will define the mechanism through which epigenetic processes control target gene selection by MYC, and have the potential to reveal new strategies to block MYC function in cancer cells. This research program will also provide an exceptional training experience centered on a cancer-focused research project within the vibrant research environment at Vanderbilt University. The education, training, collaborations, and career development program detailed in this proposal will support my career objective of becoming an independent and impactful cancer researcher."
"9441030","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons for children and adolescents to seek care in the emergency department (ED). Despite the high incidence, diagnosing appendicitis remains challenging. Computed tomography (CT) has been promoted as a method to improve diagnostic accuracy when evaluating patients with acute abdominal pain. In the past 20 years, CT use has increased dramatically, especially for children receiving care in general ED settings. Although in some adult cohorts, increased CT use has been associated with decreased rates of negative appendectomies, similar improvements in health outcomes among children with acute abdominal pain have not occurred. Negative consequences of CT include increased costs and substantial exposure to ionizing radiation. The proposed intervention, referred to as appy-CDS, is specifically designed for widespread use in EDs and could reduce reliance on advanced diagnostic imaging for pediatric and adolescent patients with acute abdominal pain while maintaining or improving clinical outcomes. This project builds on more than 10 years of work on derivation and validation of ED-based clinical decision rules, previous successful outpatient and emergency department clinical decision support interventions, and complex economic and statistical analyses of risk assessment and ED resource use. In this project, we aim to extend the benefits of our previous efforts by developing and implementing an interactive, evidence-based clinical decision support tool to optimize care for children and adolescents presenting to a general or non-pediatric ED with acute abdominal pain. The results of this project will extend our understanding of how to maximize the clinical return on massive public and private sector investments being made in sophisticated EHR systems. If successful, this flexible decision support tool could be adapted and implemented broadly in a range of acute care settings to both standardize and personalize care delivered to pediatric patients."
"9457175","Project Summary  The vasculature in the central nervous system (CNS) is essential to support and maintain brain function throughout life. To do so, the brain vasculature acquires many unique cellular and molecular properties to make up the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Reduced vascular integrity, due to a loss of these properties, is a recognized consequence of many CNS diseases, like encephalitis. Even though altered vascular integrity is thought to exacerbate encephalitis, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Addressing these gaps in our knowledge will provide insight into the underlying causes of vascular instability during encephalitis. Furthermore, understanding these mechanisms could provide a potential for developing therapeutics aimed at improving the cerebral vasculature as a means to protect the brain from further injury.  During my thesis work, I have identified that the brain vasculature is undergoing endothelial- mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) in a mouse model of viral-induced encephalitis. EndoMT contributes to vascular malformations and loss of BBB properties in a congential vasculopathy called Cerebral Cavernous Malformations. Based on this, I hypothesize that EndoMT initiates vascular instability and this is mediated by TGF? signaling, an EndoMT effector pathway. I will test this hypothesis in two distinct aims. In Aim 1, I will establish a timeline for EndoMT progression in the vasculature to understand how this relates to loss of vascular integrity and BBB properties during viral encephalitis. In Aim 2, I will identify if TGF? signaling promotes EndoMT and vascular instability thereby exacerbating disease outcome. Completion of experiments in this proposal will provide new knowledge about the cellular and molecular properties that are affected within the vasculature during encephalitis."
"9469772","Project Summary: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 10th most common cancer but the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. To date, the only FDA-approved molecular therapy, sorafenib, has not been effective. This grant is aimed at determining the role of hexokinase 2 (HK2) in HCC development and progression, and whether or not HK2 is a viable drug target for HCC treatment. Normal healthy adult hepatocytes express glucokinase, a low affinity hexokinase. However, during pathological transition to cirrhosis and HCC, transformed hepatocytes silence glucokinase and induce HK2. We have shown this isoform transition in both human HCC cell lines and in a tumor microarray of 312 samples from 153 patients. This transition also represents a more general metabolic alteration whereby cancer cells increase glucose utilization and lactate secretion despite ample oxygen being present, also known as the Warburg Effect. HK2 is a ?mitochondrial? hexokinase, meaning it is capable of binding to the voltage dependent ion channel on the mitochondria, and we have data suggesting this interaction is essential for both tumorigenesis and efficient glucose utilization. Part of this grant will determine by what mechanism the mitochondrial interaction of HK2 promotes tumorigenesis and more generally why mitochondrial binding is necessary for full glycolytic capacity. We have shown that knockdown of HK2 beyond 70% is lethal to HCC cells, and indeed another group has shown that having either HK1 or HK2 is essential for cancer cell viability using a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen. Since HCC cells only express HK2, we believe HK2 is an ideal drug target for HCC. We will determine the feasibility of this therapeutic strategy using established mouse models of HCC to determine the cell autonomous necessity of HK2 in HCC initiation and progression.  We will emulate drug therapy by using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA targeting HK2 in human HCC cells following subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. We will also determine if targeting mitochondrial glutamine metabolism synergizes with HK2 inhibition. Preliminary data suggests that production of NADPH, an important electron source for fatty acid synthesis and redox balance in cancer cells, is completely dependent on malic enzyme 1 and glutamine metabolism in HCC cells. We will exploit this dependency with a glutaminase-1 inhibitor, BPTES, or a complex-1 inhibitor, metformin in concert with HK2 inhibition. HK2 deletion should prevent compensatory activation of the pentose phosphate pathway and compensatory flux of glycolytic pyruvate into the mitochondria for TCA-flux, creating synergism with BPTES or metformin."
"9439689","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Staphylococcus aureus is a well-adapted human parasite that is both a commensal and an important pathogen. It is responsible for a wide variety of infectious diseases that range from minor skin abscesses to severe infections and toxinoses requiring hospitalization. S. aureus strains resistant to nearly all ß-lactams, so-called methicilln-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), are a leading cause of healthcare associated and, since the 1990s, community-associated infections. This epidemic of MRSA infections has enhanced the urgency to identify alternative antimicrobial agents for successful treatment. The present application concerns the vra operon that is conserved among S. aureus strains and encodes a three-component signal transduction system that senses and responds to cell-wall stress elicited by clinically important antimicrobials. Experimental interruption of the vra operon in a MRSA strain dramatically decreases the minimal inhibitory concentration of oxacillin, a methicillin congener, in MRSA strains. Thus, we wish to explore the idea that vra operon inhibition by small molecules may enhance the ability of ß-lactam antibiotics, such as oxacillin, to kill MRSA strains and treat infections caused by them. Since vra operon expression is induced by cell-wall agents from many chemical classes, the oxacillin potentiators we identify may also enhance activity of a wide variety of other antimicrobials that interfere with cell-wall synthesis such as vancomycin, cationic peptides and daptomycin."
"9541630","Project Summary ? Project 3  There is an urgent need to develop and validate novel pre-clinical models of human diarrheal diseases.  Recently, human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures have been created to accelerate in vitro investigations of  intestinal pathophysiology and to discover new therapies. These human adult stem cell derived cultures are  more physiologically faithful than monolayer cell culture or animal models, but their application to study a large  variety of intestinal commensals and enteropathogens is limited. The apical sides of epthelial cells in HIEs are  not easy for pathogens to access since they are located in the interior. In addition, current HIE culture systems  lack the ability to apply mechanical stimulation, which is physiologically relevant. Further, the main scaffold  material used to grow enteroids is Matrigel, which is softer mechanically than actual biological tissues.  Project 3 involves a collaborative goal to develop tailored biomaterial platforms for HIEs that can be  mechanically stimulated and that will promote cell and tissue polarity as well as differentiation through the  villus-crypt axis. The development of new HIE platforms will facilitate enteropathogen infection of cells, and  allow physiologic study of interactions of endothelium with the microbiome, inflammatory cells, or the sub-  endothelial intestinal tissue. These will also provide new models for future testing of drugs that can access the  apical side of the epithelium. These engineered platforms will be opportunities for synergistic interactions  between projects and cores of the overall proposal; screen-based analyses of the biology of commensal-  stimulated or viral/bacterial pathogen-stimulated intestinal epithelium will reveal information about critical cell-  matrix interactions that can be incorporated into the biomaterial platform, and as the various biomaterial  platforms are developed, they can be implemented within Projects 1-2. These platforms are also planned to  integrate with ubiquitous equipment to facilitate broad distribution to infectious disease labs.  Our collaborative team brings together expertise with native and synthetic biomaterials as scaffolds to direct  cell behavior, developing experimental frameworks for mechanically stimulating cells and tissues, promoting  vasculogenesis in engineered tissues, and culturing HIEs. We propose the following specific aims:  1. To examine the roles of independent, physiologically relevant mechanical cues on HIE culture, epithelial  cell differentiation, and pathogenic infection within HIEs, we will culture HIE fragments atop and within  collagen/Matrigel hydrogels and employ mechanical stimulation bioreactors to impose cyclic stretch and shear.  2. To develop a tailored, anatomically faithful model for the intestinal epithelium, we will generate synthetic  biomaterial platforms that drive the formation of a polarized epithelium differentiated through the villus-crypt  axis, and systematically investigate the roles of adhesive ligands, topography, and substrate stiffness.  3. To determine how other villus cells promote epithelial cell differentiation and function within intestinal  culture models, we will encapsulate mesenchymal and microvascular cells within the biomaterial platform."
"9663152","High rates of chronic upper and lower airways disease have occurred in Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) workers exposed to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster site between 9/11/2001 and 9/24/2001. The effect of WTC exposure on lung function was greater in some individuals than others. We initiated a biomarker discovery program using 8,000 serum collected within 6 months of WTC exposure to identify who was at greatest risk for adverse outcomes. To enhance our biomarker discovery program, 2,132 WTC-exposed rescue and recovery workers had serum collected between 12/2013 and 10/2015. We have identified multiple cytokines that predict future abnormal FEV1 using serum that was drawn and stored between 10/2001 and 3/2002. Since a majority of firefighters with respiratory symptoms and reactive airway disease have normal FEV1, we explored the rate of decline in FEV1 as another definition of a poor outcome. In a longitudinal study of WTC-exposed firefighters, we recently observed that about 20% had > 64 ml/year decline in FEV1, which was more than twice the average age-related decline of 32 ml/year (henceforth enhanced- FEV1-decline). Examination of the complete blood count (CBC) data stored in the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program data warehouse has revealed that higher eosinophil (Eos) and polymorphoneutrophil (PMN) concentrations are risk factors for enhanced-FEV1-decline post-9/11. Examination of available serum biomarker data from two distinct subsets of this population revealed that IgE is also a risk factor for enhanced- FEV1-decline. This proposal will confirm and extend these preliminary observations with biomarker studies on larger, more representative subsets of WTC-exposed rescue and recovery workers. We propose to use the recently obtained serum to test if biomarkers such as IgE are persistently elevated in the enhanced-FEV1- decline group. Specific AIM 1 will test the hypothesis that Eos, PMN, IgE and inflammatory cytokines measured in the 6 months post-9/11 are risk factors for enhanced-FEV1-decline using a case-control design with frequency matching. Specific AIM 2 will test the hypothesis that the IgE and cytokines measured in the 6 months post-9/11 will be associated incident airway reactivity. Specific AIM 3 will test the hypothesis that persons with high levels IgE and cytokines measured in the 6 months post-9/11 will continue to show high levels in 2013-2015. If elevated biomarker levels persist, then the information derived from this research might be applied to those without stored serum. The primary goal of this investigation is to validate biomarkers of progressive decline in lung function and airway reactivity. The ultimate goal of this line of investigation is to develop risk stratification models to identify subpopulations at high risk of adverse pulmonary outcomes after intense irritant exposure. This will allow for more intensive monitoring and early treatment of high risk individuals, instead of devoting costly resources toward intensive screening of low risk individuals."
"9494200","Project Abstract This application will fund a new, research dedicated, Siemens 3T Prisma MRI scanner. Acquiring this scanner will have an immediate substantial positive impact on the NIH funded research of a large group of researchers and the long range biomedical research goals of the institution. The specifications of the Prisma are substantially superior to our existing decade old Siemens 3T Trio, and the new scanner will provide an immediate improvement in the quality of research MRI that is able to be acquired at our institution. Additionally, current MRI equipment is used for both clinical and research imaging, which creates logistical challenges in scheduling research participants. Schedule overruns and urgent needs of emergency patients sometimes delay or displace scheduled research scans, increasing the difficulty in conducting high quality research studies. BCH carries out over 14,400 clinical MRI scans every year, with a growing wait list for both sedated and unsedated MRI. Growing clinical volume increases the logistical challenges of providing for research MRI time on our existing equipment. Pediatric MRI research is a major focus across Boston Children's Hospital. Since January 2014, Principal Investigators from over a dozen departments at BCH have held imaging study awards, with a total NIH award amount more than $57 million. These projects have provided unprecedented 1) capabilities to study disease mechanisms 2) techniques that enhance the detection and characterization of disease, and 3) innovative new interventions for disease treatment. BCH research activities span the spectrum from fundamental contributions in basic science of acquisition physics, through translational research that has brought innovation into everyday practice, to clinical research that is revolutionizing our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease. Boston Children's Hospital has a mission to provide the highest quality health care and to be the leading source of research and discovery while educating the next generation of leaders in child health. We are New England's regional referral pediatric center and a safety net hospital for the most critically ill children and those from low-income families. We partner with the community to address the most pressing health care needs in surrounding neighborhoods. The hospital trains more pediatricians and has the largest research program of any other pediatric hospital. As a not-for-profit, all of the hospital's resources go toward supporting these goals. The projects of the Users described herein will require approximately 80% of the useable time available on the scanner, and the remainder would be used for exploratory research and new directions. The scanner will be housed and managed within the Research MRI Core of the Department of Radiology at BCH, and will remain a primary research resource for a large group of imaging scientists. The instrument will be supported by an established group of MR imaging experts and support staff. A comprehensive plan has been developed for the financial and technical support of the system as well as for its management, and the system is assured of strong institutional support and oversight."

"9663606","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative (HGI) is to further understand the genetic and environmental etiologies of mental disorders. One of the major mechanisms for accomplishing this goal is the NIMH Center for Collaborative Genomics Research on Mental Disorders (the Center), which receives raw biosamples such as blood from NIMH PIs. The Center processes samples to DNA, RNA, cDNA or cell lines, which can then be submitted for genomic analyses. Along with biosamples the Center receives clinical/phenotypic data for each subject and, eventually, the results of genomic analyses. After a proprietary period, the clinical data, genomic data, DNA, RNA, cDNA and cell lines are made available to all NIMH-approved researchers through a. secure web site. This sharing of uniformly processed biological samples and clinical and genomic data from many cohorts leverages the NIMH investment in a large number of HGI grants. It provides critical research power by providing a large body of data applicable to investigations on the genetic bases for individual mental disorders. Since October 1998, >147,000 subject samples have been submitted and the Center has distributed >310,000 DNA samples and >9,000 cell lines. There have been >450 distributions of clinical and genotype data to ~340 investigators and >260 publications using these samples and data. Starting in 2011 the Center provided cell line banking and characterization services for induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and their progenitor somatic cells. The Center also develops novel bioinformatics and computational genomics tools and methodologies designed to integrate and analyze large, independent sets of genotypic and phenotypic data while resolving phenotype and/or genotype discrepancies in datasets. As its guiding aim, the Center will continue to innovate in order to serve the scientific needs of NIMH PIs in a flexible and highly accessible manner, while respecting subject confidentiality, informed consent issues and PI prerogatives."

"9445376","The innate immune response is an ancient, non antigen-specific defense system made up countermeasures that restrict the replication of pathogens early in infection. A successful innate response promotes the secretion of cytokines, particularly interferons (IFNs), that shape the later pathogen-specific acquired immune response. Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the processes that lead to the production of type I interferons (=IFN?/?) via IRFs, and the biological responses elicited by them via STAT proteins. Although IFN?/?, IRFs, and STATs have been extensively studied in the context of pathogen responses in adult organisms, their role in infectious processes during gestation has remained largely unexplored. For instance, even though interferons were discovered decades ago, it is still not clear whether they cross the so-called blood-placenta barrier, or at what point a developing fetus is capable of responding to a pathogen encounter with its own production of interferons. Similarly, it is unclear if interferons contribute to pathogen-associated birth defects. Indeed, many perinatally transmitted pathogens (e.g. hCMV, Rubella, LCMV, more recently Zika virus) are known to give rise to congenital birth defects, however, it is unclear whether the pathogen per se, or the resulting immune response is responsible for developmental deficiencies.  A novel reporter mouse strain we conceived allows for the visualization of IFN?/? encounters and provides a time-integrated picture of interferon responses. Additional reporter knock-in strains in the IFN? or IFN? locus permit the monitoring of interferon production. We intend to utilize these mice in the context of crosses to animals lacking components of the interferon system to study the induction, transmission and the effects of interferons at various stages of gestation. PolyI:C, which mimics dsRNA and thus viral infection, is a potent inducer of IFN?/?. In aim 1 we will investigate whether the IFN?/? eliciting responses in the fetus after injection of the maternal animal with PolyI:C is derived from the fetus itself, or has been transmitted through the placenta from the maternal side. Conversely, we will test whether IFN?/? might be passed from the fetus into the bloodstream of the maternal animal. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is frequently used in labs to study persistent infections by more dangerous related viruses (HIV, HCV, HBV, and now Zika virus), and causes severe birth defects similar to Zika virus. In mice, LCMV rapidly spreads systemically, is transmitted perinatally and strongly induces type I interferon production. IFN?/?-receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice are unable to clear LCMV and develop a persistent viral infection. Thus, in aim 2 we propose to use our reporter mouse strain, and crosses designed such that either only the maternal animal, or only the fetuses are IRF and/or IFN?/?-receptor deficient, to monitor type I interferon production, responses and viral loads during infection. We expect the proposed studies will significantly extend our understanding of the contributions of IRFs and type I interferons to the unique immunological environment that exists during the gestation period."

"9443667","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Model systems are used to understand how neurotransmission is regulated and how it malfunctions during diseases. Drosophila, the fruit fly, is an attractive model organism because it is easy to genetically alter, fast to breed, inexpensive, and has complex behaviors. Drosophila has many neurotransmitter systems similar to mammals, including dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. While dopamine and serotonin measurements have been made in the larval Drosophila ventral nerve cord, no measurements of endogenous release have been made in the adult fly brain. Adult flies have a fully developed nervous system and would be a good model system for studying the regulation of neurotransmitters in mental health diseases. The long-term goal of my lab is to develop new analytical tools to understand real-time neurotransmission in biological systems. The goal of this project is to characterize the regulation of dopamine and serotonin signaling in specific neuropil of the adult and larval Drosophila. Specifically, we will determine which serotonin receptors act as auto receptors and how dopamine is regulated by RING finger protein 11 (RNF11), a modulator of the NF-?B pathway. The central hypothesis is that neurotransmitter regulation varies with age and by neuropil. Aim 1 is to compare dopamine release in discrete areas of the larval and adult CNS. Release will be evoked by optically activating genetically-inserted CsChrimson and the effect of aging on dopamine release will be studied in the adult. In Aim 2, we will explore the regulation of dopamine by RNF11 using RNAi knockdown of RNF11. The effect of D2 auto receptor antagonist antipsychotics will be studied in RNF11 RNAi flies, to investigate the extent to which RNF11 affects auto receptor regulation of dopamine. These will be the first studies of the effect of RNF11 on dopamine signaling in any species. In Aim 3, we will investigate stimulated serotonin release and reuptake in larvae (protocerebrum and VNC) and adults (mushroom bodies, VNC). The serotonin system is a target of many treatments for mental illness, so understanding it in flies will enable its use as a model organism of mental diseases. Finally, for Aim 4, we will determine the effect of serotonin auto receptors on serotonin regulation in larvae and adults using both pharmacological and genetic approaches. The expected outcomes of this work are better methods for characterizing neurotransmission in specific Drosophila neuropil and an understanding of the regulation of dopamine and serotonin release throughout Drosophila development. The research is significant because it will provide foundational knowledge of neurotransmitter signaling necessary to use the powerful genetic tools available for Drosophila to study the effects of specific genes in controlling neurotransmission. Future studies could examine how dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission control behaviors or function in diseases in adult Drosophila."
"9488314","ABSTRACT Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and chronic liver diseases (CLD) and are significant health problems in the United States affecting racial/ethnic minorities disproportionately. In the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study, a long- standing ethnically diverse prospective cohort (>200,000 participants), we observed striking ethnic differences in HCC incidence with Latinos having the highest incidence followed by Native Hawaiians, African Americans, Japanese Americans, and whites. US-born Latinos, particularly men, experience the highest rates of HCC incidence in the cohort. We also found nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to be the most common cause of CLD and an unexpectedly high NALFD prevalence in Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians. These findings provide the groundwork for studies to elucidate the factors that account for health disparities across these populations. To date, no liver disease studies have included Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians; thus, a large knowledge gap remains in understanding the factors underlying disparities in HCC and NALFD in these understudied high-risk populations. The MEC with its comprehensive lifestyle, environmental, and genetic data offers a unique opportunity to elucidate the determinants that account for these health disparities. In this study we will examine the association of lifestyle, genetic, social, and contextual factors with HCC and NAFLD among MEC participants to better understand disease etiology in high-risk minorities and the factors underlying ethnic disparities. We will use existing resources of the MEC with detailed demographic, lifestyle, neighborhood- level data, health condition data, and cancer incidence and mortality information from SEER Cancer registries and state and national mortality databases, as well as a large biorepository of blood samples. These data have been collected in a consistent fashion amongst all MEC participants to permit valid ethnic comparisons. Our specific aims are 1) To quantify the contribution of known risk factors (chronic hepatitis C and B, adiposity, metabolic syndrome, alcohol intake and tobacco smoking) to ethnic differences in HCC incidence and identify additional risk factors (lifestyle and social/contextual factors) explaining the remaining ethnic variation in HCC incidence which would suggest novel or ethnic-specific mechanisms; 2) To evaluate ethnic-specific lifestyle, social and contextual factors and genetic factors that are associated with NAFLD across five ethnic groups and quantify their contributions to racial/ethnic differences in NALFD risk. Upon completion of this study, we will improve understanding of risk factors most important in certain ethnic groups and factors underlying disparities in HCC and NAFLD. The identification and defining the contribution of risk factors to racial/ethnic differences in HCC and NAFLD will be paramount for improving strategies for primary prevention of these diseases."
"9559455","ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this work is to develop a treatment for chronic wounds that will prevent wound biofilm and facilitate healing. Chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the US with annual treatment cost up to $50 billion. Despite high treatment costs, approximately 30% of patients will not heal using existing interventions and many wounds progress to serious infections, including amputations. The involvement of drug resistant organisms and multispecies biofilms is gaining recognition as an important factor in wound chronicity. There are currently no therapeutic options to address these issues. New therapeutics are urgently needed to reduce pain, improve functional outcomes, and improve quality of life for those with chronic wounds. The goal of this work is to develop an antimicrobial wound treatment based on an engineered cationic antimicrobial peptide called ASP-1 that is effective against biofilm and conducive to healing. ASP-1 displays potent activity against biofilms of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria, including multi-drug resistant organisms (DROs) over a broad range of pH and in the presence of proteins. Chitosan hydrogels containing ASP-1 will be developed for primary wound application to establish feasibility for efficacy and safety using both in vitro and animal models. The composition of hydrogels developed will be tailored to achieve a duration of ASP-1 release exceeding 3 days, which will be measured by RP-HPLC. The efficacy of hydrogels will be established first using in vitro biofilm models where challenge durations will extend over 3 day periods and biofilms tested will include methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The hydrogels will be evaluated for biocompatibility using direct contact cytotoxicity assays. These assays will be conducted for both primary human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Finally, both safety and efficacy of the ASP- 1 Hydrogel will be evaluated using a porcine model of excisional MRSA wound infection. This model will be utilized to conduct an early dose range evaluation. A commercial silver based product will be included for comparison in both the in vitro an animal studies. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate feasibility for an ASP-1 Hydrogel that provides broad spectrum antibiofilm coverage and overcomes the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity limitations associated with silver and other antiseptic products. If successful, this product will have a significant impact on reducing morbidity and improving the quality of life of patients with chronic wounds."

"9453581","PROJECT SUMMARY  AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptor in the central nervous system. Dynamic regulation of the density, subunit composition and trafficking of AMPARs into and out of excitatory synapses is a key mechanism to facilitate changes in synaptic strength important for various forms of synaptic plasticity relevant to learning and memory. Over the last twenty years, work from Huganir Laboratory and others has made significant contributions to uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic targeting of AMPARs that strengthens (long-term potentiation, LTP) or weakens (long-term depression, LTD) synaptic transmission. These studies have contributed to the prevailing model of LTP, whereby subunit-specific protein interactions and post-translational modifications within the cytosolic, carboxy (C)-terminus of AMPARs facilitate the trafficking of AMPARs to synapses and thereby enhance synaptic transmission. Recent work challenged this model and the requirement for the C-termini of AMPARs, as well as their interacting partners, to mediate LTP. It was found that not only could AMPAR mutants that lack the C- terminal domain rescue LTP in mice deficient all AMPARs (GluA1-A3), but so could GluK1, which belongs to the distinct, Kainate subclass of ionotropic glutamate receptors not normally found at these synapses. While these data remain a topic of debate, AMPA and Kainate receptors shared conserved structural architecture in their extracellular domains, raising the intriguing and less explored possibility that the extracellular domains of specific AMPAR subunits might also play key roles in regulating the synaptic targeting of the receptors.  In this research proposal we will investigate the hypothesis that synaptic targeting of AMPARs required to induce long-term changes in synaptic strength is bi-directionally regulated by coordinated protein-protein interactions with the N- and C-termini. To test this hypothesis we have developed an assay that uses proximity- labeling with APEX2-tagged to the N- or C-termini of AMPAR subunits to perform an unbiased, proteomic screen to identify proteins that endogenously interact with either the extracellular or intracellular domains of GluA1- and GluA2-containing AMPARs during synaptic plasticity. Selected candidate proteins that demonstrate validated, dynamic and specific interactions with AMPAR subunits will be further characterized using overexpression and knockdown approaches to evaluate their role in regulating the synaptic targeting and function of AMPARs during synaptic plasticity. By identifying and characterizing new, functionally-relevant interactions between synaptic proteins and AMPARs, the proposed research will provide significant insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying plasticity relevant to learning, memory and higher brain function. Further, these studies have broad implications for brain disorders involving synaptic dysfunction as they might reveal novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases."
"9443139","Project Summary Significance: Black drinkers experience more alcohol problems than White drinkers even at equivalent levels of alcohol use. These problems are pervasive, occurring across physical, social, and legal outcomes. The reasons that explain why Black drinkers are at elevated risk for experiencing alcohol problems are understudied and not well understood, but may involve differences in level of stress and acute response to alcohol. The proposed R01 examines these constructs both within the laboratory and in the natural environment using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to identify proximal points of intervention for both Black and White drinkers. Aims: Aim 1 will examine racial differences in the anxiolytic effects of alcohol prior to and after a stress induction in the lab. Aim 2 will directly test if differential alcohol response measured in the lab strengthens the association between stress and alcohol cognitions (craving for alcohol, drinking motives), and accounts for racial differences in these cognitions. Aim 3 will examine the extent to which lab-based alcohol response and daily reports of stress explain racial differences in alcohol problems through 12-month follow-up. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that Black drinkers will have increased sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of alcohol compared to White drinkers and that this sensitivity to alcohol as well as elevated stress will predict increased risky alcohol cognitions in EMA. Additionally, the association between stress and alcohol cognitions will be stronger for participants with the most sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of alcohol. EMA alcohol cognitions will partially account for the association between alcohol response, stress, and alcohol problems during the EMA period and at the 6- and 12- month follow-ups. These processes and their transaction will partially account for why Black drinkers, relative to White drinkers, experience more alcohol problems. Approach: Young adult drinkers (N = 280; 21-30 years of age; 50% Black, 50% female) will be recruited from the community. Participants will first complete a semi-structured diagnostic interview and questionnaires and will then complete two laboratory sessions (placebo and alcohol; randomized order) with a standardized stress task to assess acute alcohol response. Next, participants will complete a 17-day EMA protocol to record fluctuations in stress, alcohol cognitions, alcohol response, alcohol use/problems. To allow for the prediction of prospective outcomes follow-up assessments at 6- and 12- months will be conducted and will include past 6 month self-reported alcohol use, alcohol problems, stress, and alcohol cognitions, as well as a 90-day timeline follow-back interview. This R01 proposal is directly in line with the NIAAA's strategic priorities to understand the role of stress in relation to alcohol problems and to decrease health disparities. The proposed research takes a critical step towards increasing our understanding of why Black drinkers are at greater risk for alcohol problems and will ultimately inform intervention efforts that are tailored to this under-studied, at-risk, population."
"9465840","The overarching goal of this project is to develop a highly effective vaccine for prevention of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria based on a genetically attenuated (GA) triple gene knockout sporozoite (SPZ)-stage parasite that is aseptic, purified and safe for parenteral injection. In this Phase I application, we propose to optimize the manufacturing processes for the vaccine (Sanaria® PfSPZ-GA2) and produce 1 lot suitable for clinical testing following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). There is a high likelihood of success based on (1) the sterilizing immunity induced in humans immunized with attenuated PfSPZ (1st shown in 1970s) and (2) the tremendous progress achieved in manufacture and clinical testing of a 1st generation PfSPZ-based vaccine, called Sanaria® PfSPZ Vaccine. In clinical trials in the U.S, Germany, Mali and Tanzania, PfSPZ Vaccine, which is attenuated by radiation rather than by discrete gene knockout, has induced >90% sterile protective immunity against controlled human infection (CHMI) conducted 3 weeks after immunization (5 clinical trials), and protection against heterologous CHMI at 8 months. Moreover, we documented sterile protection durable for at least 6 months against intense naturally transmitted Pf malaria in the field in Africa (2 clinical trials). PfSPZ Vaccine is being assessed in 7 clinical trials in the U.S., Germany and Africa, with licensure by the U.S. FDA anticipated in ~2.5 to 3 years. Importantly, PfSPZ Vaccine has proven exceptionally safe and well tolerated in all recipients (>1,100), including infants, children and adults. However, manufacture of PfSPZ Vaccine entails operator risks (PfSPZ are fully infectious prior to irradiation) and the genetic damage is not precisely characterized. For these reasons, we believe that there would be significant advantages, leading to major savings in cost of goods (COGs), if radiation-attenuated parasites were replaced with GA parasites. GA parasites are safer for operators (cannot cause malaria), the genetic defect is precisely characterized, and there may be improved in potency. Our colleagues at the Center for Infectious Disease Research demonstrated that eliminating the sap1, p52 and p36 genes leads to complete attenuation at the liver stage, similar to after radiation. This murine malaria triple knock-out elicited excellent protective immunity against SPZ challenge in rodents, and the Pf?p52?p36?sap1 SPZ construct, PfGAP3KO, was safe, well tolerated and immunogenic when administered to humans via mosquito bite, and did not cause breakthrough blood stage infections. Based on these encouraging data, we propose expedited development of aseptic, purified, vialed, cryopreserved ?p52?p36?sap1 PfSPZ. The vaccine (PfSPZ-GA2) will l be manufactured and quality control released in compliance with GMPs. Specific aims are to (1) optimize production parameters; (2) generate Master and Working Cell Banks; (3) manufacture 1 clinical lot. This will launch clinical development of the vaccine with the objective of licensing PfSPZ-GA2 for preventing malaria in travelers, for preventing pregnancy malaria and for mass vaccination programs (MVPs) aimed at regional malaria elimination."
"9432474","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While antigen specific-IgE is important for immunity against intestinal helminths, these pathogens generate high levels of largely non-specific IgE. This hinders the parasite-specific IgE thereby reducing mast cell degranulation and anti-helminth immunity. Thus, this represents a protective response that has evolved for the helminth: non-specific or low affinity IgE blocks high affinity IgE receptors (Fc?RI) and thereby protects the helminth. The initial studies in this proposal indicate that B1 cells are responsible for the large IgE induced by helminth infection, in which cytokines act on B1 cells, promoting IgE production. In this application I further examine B1 B cell IgE production as the source of non-specific IgE in helminth infection, and then investigate the protective capacity of B1 IgE as an explanation for why helminth infection is protective against allergic disease. To this end, I plan to utilize a mouse model with a membrane IgE reporter to track the development of IgE in B1 compartments during helminth infection as well as rounds of division needed to class switch to IgE. I will additionally use a Rag1-/- mice reconstitution model, in which B1 or B2 cell IgE contributions to helminth infection clearance can be examined. I also plan to investigate the role of the cytokine IL-5 as a priming agent for B1 cell IgE production. The class switch recombination patterns of IgE have never been examined in B1 cells. I plan to analyze the switch regions (s), s? to s? for s?1 fragments. This protocol will determine if B1 cells undergoa direct switch from ? to ?, which is typical for low-affinity antibody production. Next, I plan toshow the B1 IgE can block MC degranulation in models of anaphylaxis. Also B1 IgE production will be assessed utilizing the reconstituted RAG-/- mice that are helminth infected and then sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) in a MC-dependent HDM model of mouse asthma. The reduced airway hyper-responsiveness seen with concurrent helminth infection should be diminished in B2 only reconstituted mice without the presence of B1 IgE. Next, I will test the underlying factors that push B1 cells to IgE in helminth infection. Preliminary evidence indicates that IL-5 may prime B1 cells to switch to IgE, I will expand the B1 cells with IL-5 and compare the IgE production in RAG-/- mice reconstituted with the IL-5 expanded B1 versus B1 from naïve mice. I hypothesize that IL-5 will push B1 cells to IgE production and when these mice are subjected to a HDM asthma model, they will have a decreased response as compared to non-IL-5 primed B1 reconstituted mice."
"9540151","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The exclusively blood-feeding blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis is the most medically relevant vector of infectious diseases in the United States. Despite the public health importance of I. scapularis, which transmits over six pathogens, including the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, this non-insect arthropod vector is understudied. The molecular details of vector-pathogen interactions and non-insect arthropod immune responses remain relatively poorly characterized. The recent description of the tick immune deficiency (IMD) pathway elucidated one facet of the tick response to B. burgdorferi. The IMD pathway is centrally regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), which serves to polyubiquitylate target proteins, forming ubiquitin scaffolds. Substrates of XIAP in the context of tick-B. burgdorferi interactions remain unknown. In this F31 application, we report an interacting partner, p47, which is shown to participate in the tick immune response to B. burgdorferi by restricting pathogen acquisition in I. scapularis. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that XIAP binds and polyubiquitylates p47 in a lysine (K)63-dependent manner. We will investigate this hypothesis in two aims. In Aim 1, the molecular and biophysical details of the XIAP-p47 interaction will be systematically examined by using p47 deletion mutants in binding assays with XIAP, as well as surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry. In Aim 2, biochemical interactions between XIAP and p47 will be investigated by performing in vitro polyubiquitylation assays and mass spectrometry to identify which residues of p47 are polyubiquitylated. By completing the aims of the proposed research, we will characterize a substrate of XIAP, which will improve our understanding of the tick IMD pathway. These findings will also contribute to unraveling novel scientific paradigms in tick-pathogen interactions."
"9563741","Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV infection into a chronic disease, it is not curative. ART does not target latent, integrated provirus harbored in memory CD4+ T cells. These cells are relatively rare, possibly on the order of 1 in a million frequency, and it is not yet possible to identify all of them prospectively. Any method that aims to eliminate or inactivate provirus must be highly efficient and work in vivo. It is also known that disrupting ccr5 can result in resistance to HIV and is the basis of the single individual cured of HIV. A technique that could efficiently target and disrupt ccr5 in CD4+ T cells and other cell types in vivo would be preferable over current methodologies that rely on ex vivo manipulation. For this application we propose to develop and optimize a helper-dependent adenoviral (HDAd) vector termed 5/35++ that is capable of targeting and efficiently transducing CD4+ T cells and hematopoietic progenitors. HDAds are essentially ?gutted? adenoviruses that can package up to 30 kb of foreign DNA and also rely on a helper virus (HV) for amplification. In addition, as opposed to adeno-associated vectors, once the HDAd has been amplified it is facile to re-amplify the HDAd to extremely high titers of ~1013 vp/ml. Although most HVs used for amplification are serotype 5-based, it was recently reported that an Ad5/F35 HV (5/35++) has enhanced in vivo targeting for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell gene delivery. We propose using this novel Ad5/F35 HV to target HDAds to human CD4+ T cells and other hematopoietic progenitors, first in vitro and then in vivo, the latter in humanized mouse models in collaboration with my colleague Dr. Priti Kumar at Yale. Initially the HDAds will encode eGFP and luciferase to allow in vitro FACS analysis and in vivo imaging, respectively, but other constructs will include the components of multiple, orthogonal CRISPR systems (both nuclease and guide RNAs) for more efficient targeting of host gene ccr5 in vivo. This includes encoding multiple guide RNAs, each targeting ccr5 and separated by distinct tRNAs, in RNAPIII promoter-driven constructs. These will be tested both in vitro and in vivo, the latter in an HIV challenge model in humanized mice. In addition, in order to expand the repertoire of HVs capable of targeting T cells and progenitors, HVs based on several other adenovirus serotypes with those properties will be constructed, amplified, and tested in vitro. This should allow repeated injections of HDAds in immunocompetent animals and man, without the concern for the development of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies that would limit efficiency. At the end of the 24 month funding period it is hoped that the potential of this novel HV/HDAd system for targeting both CD4+ T cells and hematopoietic progenitors in vivo will have been realized. Although the application focuses on targeting ccr5, similar methods may be applied for inactivating integrated HIV provirus, especially given the fact that adenovirus can be retargeted to other cells using fiber gene fusions and given the recent result that CD32a may be a biomarker for latently HIV-infected memory T cells."
"9484330","The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (?naturalistic?) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y)."
"9510877","The objective of the proposed research is to target BMP signaling as a therapy for melanoma. Recent data indicate that BMP signaling in melanomas is driven by the BMP ligand GDF6, which becomes expressed in melanoma cells during the tumorigenic process. Inhibition of GDF6 kills melanoma cells in vitro and abrogates tumor growth in vivo. The presence of high GDF6 expression in patient tumors is correlated with metastatic progression and low survival. Taken together, these data indicate that targeting GDF6 could be an effective melanoma therapy. GDF6 acts as an extracellular ligand, and a panel of monoclonal antibodies that recognize the mature, secreted form of GDF6 has been generated. This panel of monoclonals will be assessed for specific binding and anti-tumor efficacy in two aims. In the first aim, anti-GDF6 monoclonals will be epitope- mapped and their binding affinities measured. In addition, their ability to bind cell surface receptors will be assessed as will their ability to kill melanoma cells in vitro. In the second aim, monoclonals with the best binding and in vitro efficacy profiles will be tested for their effects on tumor growth in vivo. Sufficient quantities of monoclonals will be produced for injections into tumor-bearing mice. Xenografts will be created and monoclonals injected to determine if these anti-GDF6 antibodies can cause tumor regression on their own as well as in cooperation with current standard therapies. The proposed studies will be the first targeting of BMP signaling in melanoma and represent an orthogonal approach to complement existing small molecule and immunotherapies, which benefit only a subset of late-stage melanoma patients and often do so only transiently. Establishing efficacy of anti-GDF6 antibodies in the proposed studies would serve as a springboard to making humanized versions and clinical testing of such antibodies."
"9574492","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early life perturbations, such as stress, are associated with long-term consequences on the developing brain, increasing subsequent risk of neuropsychiatric disorders that exhibit a sex bias in presentation, including schizophrenia, depression, and autism spectrum disorders. Despite advances in understanding the mechanistic roles of the maternal milieu in normal and pathological brain development, many question remain about how stress during pregnancy result in the development of offspring stress dysregulation, a pervasive symptom in neuropsychiatric disease. Recent studies indicate that maternal gut microbial communities are dynamically remodeled during pregnancy to maintain a continuous supply of nutrients to the developing fetus and prepare the mothers for the energetic demands of lactation. In our established mouse model of early prenatal stress (EPS), our preliminary studies show that newborns exposed to EPS exhibit sex-specific alterations in metabolic profiles related to energy balance and homeostasis, and, based on recent studies, may suggest that maternal changes in microbial-mediated nutrient availability may account for altered metabolite profiles in exposed offspring. Taken together, these results have led us to the hypothesis that brain development is altered by the impact of stress during pregnancy on the maternal gut microbiome and nutrient availability. Using cutting-edge `omics technologies, we aim to identify novel connections between maternal stress, the maternal gut microbiome and metabolism, and sex-specific brain development. The first aim of study will examine whether stress during pregnancy disrupts maternal gut microbiota and nutrient profiles critical for fetal brain development. This aim will utilize time-series profiling of the maternal gut microbiota, maternal peripheral metabolite and nutrient availability, and fetal brain metabolite profiles using combined metagenomics and metabolomics assessment, in addition to computational tools that integrate these datasets. As the effect of prenatal stress reprogramming on the developing brain may not emerge until later in development, the second aim will examine the lasting effect of stress on the maternal gut microbiota composition and nutrient availability on the brain development during the postnatal period. This aim will utilize time-series profiling of maternal gut microbiota, maternal breast milk composition, and metabolite profiles of the offspring hypothalamus using combined metagenomics and metabolomics assessment, in addition to computational tools that integrate these datasets. The final aim will determine causality of the maternal gut microbiome on brain development. Following colonization with probiotics during the window of stress exposure, then examine the impact on rescuing maternal gut microbiota composition, maternal nutrient availability, and sex-specific brain metabolite composition. Together, these studies will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which brain development is altered through the effect of stress on the maternal gut microbiome and nutrient availability necessary for normal neurodevelopment."
"9540720","ABSTRACT  This proposal is to enhance the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) site in Rochester, NY, which has for 10 years been focused on prospective, population-based surveillance for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) caused by rotavirus, norovirus, and other viral pathogens, and for the past year, population-based surveillance for acute respiratory infections. We propose to continue and extend surveillance for ARI with a focus on influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68), and other vaccine- preventable or potentially vaccine-preventable viruses, in order to both measure influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza infections among hospitalized children <18 years of age, and to assess the inpatient burden of viral pathogens associated with ARIs, particularly influenza, RSV and EV-D68. We also will continue the AGE surveillance to allow for similar determinations of AGE burden and rotavirus vaccine efficacy among children hospitalized or visiting the emergency departments.  The over-arching goal of the NVSN is to inform the nation about the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), and the impact of new vaccines and vaccine policies. Our Rochester NVSN site (a founding NVSN member), has been a leader in shaping all aspects of the NVSN, including population-based surveillance for new or upcoming vaccines, vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies, refinement of diagnostic laboratory methods, health services and epidemiologic studies, and dissemination of findings. We have the infrastructure and comprehensive expertise to begin all activities on day 1 of the funding period.  Our NVSN site has: experienced personnel who have led and published many past NVSN influenza VE, surveillance, and molecular diagnostic laboratory studies; accurate laboratory and surveillance techniques consistent with CDC procedures; and outstanding epidemiologic and health services research capabilities. We have full access to all hospital and ED databases to complement surveillance activities. Our catchment area, the Monroe County NY/Rochester Metropolitan Statistical Area, has a total population of >1,000,000; >95% of ARI admissions for Monroe County resident children <18 years of age occur at our two NVSN hospitals, with nearly 1,000 hospitalizations for ARIs per year. Thus, we have a ?captured population? precisely suited for the NVSN population-based surveillance projects. This proposal will provide critical information to develop sound polices consistent with national goals to preventing VPD in children."

"9526224","PROJECT SUMMARY: Liver cancer is a common cause of cancer death worldwide, estimated to be responsible for over 700,000 deaths annually. There are multiple risk factors for liver cancer including alcohol abuse, chronic infection with hepatitis B or C viruses, cirrhosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and consumption of aflatoxin-contaminated food. Liver damage and inflammation are common elements inherent to these risk factors.  Cancer genome sequencing data has established tumor type-specific mutational spectra for a variety of tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In some cases (lung cancer in smokers, skin cancers, certain urothelial carcinomas), the mutational patterns can be used to infer the involvement of exposures and certain types of DNA adducts in cancer etiology. For HCC, a dominant mutational signature has been found and is present across different geographic regions. This signature consists of AàG transitions, which are rare in other tumor types. The AàG mutations are particularly enriched on the non-transcribed strand of expressed genes and increase with gene expression levels, a phenomenon referred to as transcription-coupled DNA damage. We hypothesize that the adducts initiating the liver cancer AàG signature preferentially form at single-stranded regions in transcribed genes called R-loops. We further hypothesize that lipid peroxidation product-derived bifunctional aldehydes formed in the liver as a consequence of inflammation and oxidative stress produce etheno- adenine DNA adducts selectively at these single-stranded regions and cause AàG mutations as a consequence of lesion-tolerant DNA polymerase bypass which inserts cytosine across the etheno-A adducts. We propose two Specific Aims to test our hypothesis:  In Aim 1, we propose to develop a novel method for genome-wide adductomics and will focus on etheno-A adducts induced by bifunctional aldehydes. We will determine if these adducts are more frequent in genomic sequences that are highly transcribed and form R-loops. In Aim 2, we will establish the mutational spectra of lipid peroxidation product-derived aldehyde adducts in immortalized hepatocyte single cell clones. The sequencing data will be used to derive a mutational spectrum of the treated cells in comparison to control solvent-treated cells. We will thus determine if the tested bifunctional aldehydes are capable of producing AàG mutations, similar to those found in HCC genomes. This application is aimed at developing a test system for identifying the causative mutagens for liver cancer including their respective DNA adducts and induced mutations. Method development is a significant component of this application."
"9537977","Project Summary: Currently, there is a need for strategies that mitigate acute radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome (RIGS). The risk of large populations encountering radiation exposure is real and growing. Although a few drugs are available which can protect radiation injury if applied prior to radiation exposure, to date there are no agents available which can be applied 24 hr post-exposure to mitigate the acute radiation syndrome. The high radiosensitivity of the intestinal epithelium increases susceptibility to RIGS; and with mortality within 10-15 days there is limited time for therapeutic intervention. We have developed a human peripheral blood mono nuclear cell derived macrophage committed progenitor (MCP) cell therapy which can mitigate RIGS and improve survival when applied 24 hr after an otherwise lethal dose of radiation exposure. These progenitor cells are modulated ex-vivo to increase expression of WNT ligand, a major paracrine signal for intestinal epithelial regeneration. In this project we will fully characterize this novel cell therapy with a determination of an optimum dose and schedule for mitigation of RIGS. We will examine the general applicability of this strategy in young and radiosensitive animals. Finally we will evaluate the involvement of MCP derived WNT signaling in repair and regeneration of intestinal stem cells."
"9467361","Project Summary/Abstract Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) connect the eyes to the brain and are essential for vertebrate vision. One therapeutic goal of vision scientists is to fully understand the factors required for RGC development, so these cells can be generated in vitro. The proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein ATOH7 is expressed transiently in a subpopulation of early retinal progenitor cells and an essential competence factor for RGC genesis. Loss of ATOH7 causes optic nerve aplasia and severe retinovascular malformations. In humans with nonsyndromic congenital retinal nonattachment (NCRNA), a remote 5' conserved enhancer for ATOH7 is deleted, preventing development of RGCs, leading to total blindness from birth. This DNA segment is obviously vital, but its exact role is unknown. In preliminary transgene reporter experiments, this `shadow' enhancer appears to be wholly redundant with the `primary' (promoter-adjacent) enhancer. In this project, I will investigate ATOH7 transcriptional regulation in detail, to understand how specific DNA sequences control the level, timing and pattern of expression. As RGCs are the first-born retinal neurons, these dual enhancers effectively determine the onset of neurogenesis in the vertebrate eye. How does the shadow enhancer influence Atoh7 expression at transcriptional and chromatin levels to ensure RGC development occurs? To evaluate shadow enhancer function, I will generate a mouse model of NCRNA disease, using CRISPR/Cas9 methods to delete this segment in fertilized oocytes, and investigate how the deletion affects retinal histogenesis, Atoh7 expression and regional chromatin status during development. Transcription will be assessed by two methods ? [1] an internally controlled competitive RT-PCR, in heterozyotes carrying the SEdel or wild-type allele with an Atoh7HA knock-in allele in trans, and [2] qPCR analysis of Atoh7 mRNA abundance in an allelic series of wild-type, KO and SEdel embryos. Atoh7 chromatin landscape will be evaluated by chromatin conformation capture (3C) and ATAC-seq methods, to profile DNA looping and nucleosome exposure, respectively. These data will extend our knowledge of Atoh7 regulation, the onset of retinal neurogenesis, RGC fate specification, and the action of binary enhancers generally."
"9444478","PROJECT SUMMARY Because of the staggering complexity of biological systems, biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge stored in a computable form. The Gene Ontology (GO) is by far the largest knowledgebase of how genes function, and has become a critical component of the computational infrastructure enabling the genomic revolution. It has become nearly indispensible in the interpretation of large- scale molecular measurements in biological research. Crucially, for human health research, GO is also one of a suite of complementary ontologies constructed in such as way to maximally promote interoperability and comparability of data sets. It represents the gene functions and biological processes that are perturbed in human disease, e.g. via the links from Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) class abnormality of lipid metabolism, defined in relation to the GO class lipid metabolic process (GO_0006629), researchers or clinicians can find the set of genes that are known to be involved in this process. GO is a knowledge resource that can be statistically mined, either standalone or in combination with data from other knowledge resources, which enables experts to discover connections and form new hypotheses from the biological networks GO represents. All knowledge in GO is represented using semantic web technologies and so is amenable to computational integration and consistency checking. The proposed GO knowledge environment will enable a wider community of scientists to contribute to, and to utilize, a common, computable representation of biology. To ensure the knowledge environment meets the requirements of biomedical researchers, we will: a) deliver a comprehensive, detailed, computable knowledgebase of gene function, encoded in the Gene Ontology and annotations (computer-readable statements about the how specific genes function), focusing on human biology; b) provide a ?hub? for a broad community of scientists to collaboratively extend, correct and improve the knowledgebase; c) ensure the GO knowledge resource is of the highest quality with regards to depth, breadth and accuracy; d) facilitate the transfer of insights obtained from studies of non-human organisms, such as the mouse and zebrafish, to human biology; and e) enable the scientific community to use the knowledgebase in analyses of large-scale genetic and -omics data. Our aims reflect the essential requirements for realizing the overarching objectives for a biomedical data resource: efficiently capturing and integrating biological knowledge and adhering to the highest possible standard for accuracy and detail; constructing and providing a robust, flexible, powerful, and extensible technological infrastructure available not only for internal use but just as easily by the wider community; and lastly, leveraging state-of-the-art social media, web services and other technologies to disseminate the GO resource to the entire biomedical research community."

We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). !"
"9526863","Project Summary/Abstract  Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the large and mid-sized arteries that promotes the development of cardiovascular disease through plaque formation, restricted blood flow, and ultimately thrombotic events. Chronic exposure of the arterial endothelium to elevated (and potentially modified) serum cholesterol leads to the hallmarks of pathology; including altered blood flow patterns, endothelial activation, and recruitment of blood monocytes. Infiltrating monocytes differentiate into lipid-laden plaque macrophages and contribute to the necrotic core that is a hallmark of advanced lesions. Research has focused on the role of monocytes in the maintenance of atherosclerotic plaques however; relatively few resources have been dedicated to investigating the role of tissue-resident mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), which reside in the aortic arch. Resident MNPs reside in the nascent aorta at birth in locations where plaques have propensity to develop, and the cells are even present there in animals not susceptible to disease. My preliminary studies definitively show these cells are macrophage lineage cells, not dendritic cells as previously reported and may facilitate the onset of early plaque by importing the first quantitative load of cholesterol into the intima. Thus, these cells may be pivotal in regulating atherosclerotic plaque burden. However, technical approaches to determine if intimal resident macrophages persist in plaques and carry out distinct roles have not emerged to address this possibility.  I have established protocols to track and modulate the resident intimal macrophage population independent of infiltrating blood-derived precursors like monocytes. I find that resident macrophages are the first cells to take up lipid in the aortic wall and persist through plaque development. Resident macrophages reside inside regions known to develop into necrotic core, and also form a ?boarder? around the plaque itself. Further, I have developed approaches to track proliferation of macrophages within the plaque, as well as use new technologies to isolate intimal macrophages without contamination from monocytes or adventitial macrophages. Primarily using a combination of fixed- and live-imaging approaches in murine atherosclerotic plaque and taking advantage of new mouse models, I will test the hypothesis that resident aortic intimal macrophages, independent of recruited monocyte-derived macrophages, play a unique and important role in atherosclerotic plaque development. To test my hypothesis, I will assess the role of proliferation and motility in the plaques, address the differential roles of resident versus recruited monocytes in disease progression, and further develop intravital approaches to understand how interactions between monocytes and intimal macrophages may contribute to disease severity. If true, the implications of this study would greatly clarify and alter how the field might target macrophages or circulating monocytes to manage atherosclerotic disease."
"9419276","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fractures are a significant problem in pediatric orthopedics. One third of childhood fractures involve the growth plate, a fragile, cartilaginous region in long bones that provides signaling for continued growth in children. Growth plate injuries occur from both high and low impact events, ranging from vehicular accidents to simple falls. Such injuries can result in the formation of a bony bar in which bony tissue replaces normal growth plate cartilage. This can result in angular deformities or complete growth cessation in the affected bone. Unfortunately, current growth plate injury treatments are invasive, prone to infections, and have low success rates. There is no treatment available that can fully regenerate the growth plate and ensure normal longitudinal bone growth. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a clinically useful biological therapy for growth plate regeneration. The objective of the current application is to prevent bony bar formation, replacing it instead with a cartilaginous tissue that more closely resembles the native growth plate and may restore normal longitudinal bone growth. Recent advances have elucidated mechanisms that affect bony bar formation as well as pathways that can promote regeneration. It has been shown that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its associated angiogenesis in the injured growth plate can trigger bony bar formation. As well, it has been reported that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) infiltrate the injury site, express osteogenic markers, and participate in bony bar formation. In this project, we propose to prevent or replace bony bar formation in the injured growth plate by blocking angiogenesis and associated bone formation (Aim 1), recruiting more endogenous MSCs to the injured area by delivery of stem cell migratory factors (Aim 2), and promoting MSC chondrogenesis rather than osteogenesis by exposing them to a chondrogenic factor (Aim 3). This will be tested in a rat model of growth plate injury by using an injectable biomaterial delivery system that will sequentially release three therapeutic factors locally: (1) anti-VEGF antibody to block angiogenesis and bone formation, (2) a stem cell attracting factor such as SDF-1 or CCL25 to recruit endogenous MSCs to the injured area, and (3) TGF-?1 to direct the recruited stem cells down the cartilage lineage instead of the bone lineage. Overall, data from these studies will contribute new information to the basic biology of growth plate repair, and will also provide information on the translational potential of the proposed therapeutic approach. This will pave the way for further development of a novel treatment that not only prevents bony bar formation but also promotes formation of a functional tissue engineered growth plate that can prevent growth problems associated with growth plate injuries."
"9447218","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The regenerative capacity of airway epithelium in response to injury is critical for lung recovery from environmental insults and preventing the progression of respiratory diseases. So it is important to understand how epithelial regeneration is regulated to potentially enhance recovery and reduce lung injury. MicroRNAs and Hippo pathway have emerged as key modulators of both organ development and adult tissue repair and regeneration. We recently demonstrated that the microRNA cluster, miR302-367, promotes a high level of cell proliferation but less differentiated phenotype in the developing lung and heart. Overexpression of miR302-367 in adult heart promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration. MiR302-367 functions, in part, by targeting several components of the Hippo signaling pathway, which negatively regulates the activity of Yap and Taz. Yap and Taz are key transcriptional co-activators that drive the expression of their downstream targets to promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell death. We have explored the mechanisms that regulate alveolar epithelial repair and regeneration in adult lung following injury induced by bacterial pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia remains a leading cause of mortality in children and the elderly. While extensive studies have focused on bacterial virulence and host immune responses, little is known about the type lung injury induced by bacterial pneumonia and their subsequent regeneration and repair. We show that mice with infection of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) have markedly injuries in the lung parenchyma followed by visible repair and regeneration. In response to Sp-induced injury, pre-existing SPC-expressing epithelial type II cells in the alveolus function as epithelial progenitor cells. They proliferate and differentiate ito type I cell at the sites of affected alveolar region. Notably, the expression of miR302-367 and Yap/Taz target, Cysteine rich protein 61, is increased in distal lung epithelium. Overexpression of miRNA302-367 in SPC- expressing cells enhanced alveolar epithelial repair and regeneration. Administration of small molecule miR302-mimics in mice with bacterial pneumonia promoted distal airway epithelial regeneration, enhanced mouse recovery and survival. Based on these preliminary studies, we hypothesize that miR302-367 and Hippo pathway regulate lung epithelial gene transcription to promote epithelial repair and regeneration. Targeting microRNA-Hippo pathway may represent a novel therapeutic approach to promote recovery from injury induced by bacterial pneumonia. This project aims to define the mechanistic role of miR302-367 and Hippo signaling in distal airway epithelial repair and regeneration by (1) modulating miR302-367 and Yap/Taz expression in alveolar epithelial progenitor cells in murine model system, and (2) by defining the interactions of miR302-367 and Hippo signaling in governing gene network that control alveolar epithelial repair and regeneration, and (3) by examining the therapeutic potentials of miR-mimics and inhibiting Hippo pathway in recovery from bacteria-induced injury."
"9460564","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of the proposed trial, International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA), is to define the role of an invasive approach in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) and substantial ischemia. The trial hypothesis is that cardiac catheterization followed by complete revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) is superior to OMT alone as the management strategy for patients with moderate-severe ischemia on stress imaging. The primary endpoint will be time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for unstable angina, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or heart failure. The hypothesis that the invasive strategy will improve quality of life will also be tested. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed.   The COURAGE and BARI 2D trials found that an initial management strategy of coronary revascularization did not reduce the risk of death or MI compared with OMT alone in SIHD patients selected on the basis of coronary anatomy. These data raise the question whether cardiac catheterization (cath) is required in stable patients. Cath in such patients usually leads to revascularization. Although COURAGE and BARI 2D included a broad range of severity of myocardial ischemia on stress testing, most patients had mild-moderate ischemia. Observational data suggest that revascularization of patients with moderate-severe ischemia is associated with a lower likelihood of death and MI; this is not observed in patients with lesser degrees of ischemia. Only about half of patients with moderate-severe ischemia are referred for cath. It is unknown whether use rates for cath and revascularization are appropriate for optimal patient management in the era of modern medical therapy (particularly with high dose statins and antiplatelet therapy). This issue cannot be resolved using available data because prior clinical trials in SIHD have enrolled patients after cath, at which point there is substantial selection bias for enrollment based on coronary anatomy. Given the potential for improved survival and fewer cardiac events as a result of revascularization and the significant expense and risks associated with invasive management, the role of an invasive strategy is critically important to define. Defining that role is among the top 100 US priorities for comparative effectiveness research.    The proposed ISCHEMIA trial will be a prospective, multicenter, international, randomized, controlled trial that will directly address the need for an invasive strategy-cath and revascularization-in patients with SIHD. A total of 8,000 patients with moderate-severe ischemia and left ventricular ejection fraction >35% will be enrolled after stress imaging from more than 400 sites. Based on the need to exclude significant left main coronary artery disease, patients who meet eligibility criteria will undergo blinded coronary CT angiography. Patients will be randomized to an invasive group that will undergo routine cath with optimal revascularization, if feasible, plus OMT or to a group that receives OMT alone."
"9468842","PROJECT SUMMARY A traumatic knee injury in adolescence and early adulthood results in an abrupt halt to sports activity. The subsequent trajectories of a return to sports and their effects on long-term physical activity behavior, weight gain, and ultimately knee osteoarthritis (OA) are not known. One likely consequence is weight gain. Obesity, in addition to knee injury, is a known risk factor for the development and progression of knee OA. Thus, weight gain following injury may accelerate the development of OA and increase the risk for early joint replacement and functional decline. The long-term objective of this fellowship application is to prepare the applicant to be a successful independent scientist focused on the consequences of injury in early adulthood in order to prevent/delay the development of chronic disease and optimize long-term quality of life. As a step towards this goal, the objective of this proposal is to evaluate sports activity, physical activity, weight gain, and the development of knee OA after knee injury. The central hypothesis is that reductions in sports activity after knee injury contribute to weight gain, which subsequently increases the risk of inactivity and incident knee OA in the long-term. This proposal capitalizes on an on-going longitudinal study of clinical and functional outcomes in individuals after knee injury, specifically anterior cruciate injury and reconstruction (n=150). Outcome data were collected at baseline (soon after injury), and at the 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 5-year follow-ups. 10-year follow-up data collection is on-going. Aim 1 will determine the trajectories of sports activity from 1 to 5 years after knee injury and the association of these trajectories with physical activity at 10-years. Aim 2 will investigate changes in body weight immediately (baseline to 6 months) and in the short-term (1 to 5 years) after knee injury, and how weight change relates to sports activity. Aim 3 will estimate the association of sports activity and weight status with incident knee OA after knee injury. The results of this proposal will provide a critical understanding of potential health consequences related to inactivity after injury, and serve as impetus to develop a long-term strategy to maintain knee health after injury through physical activity and healthy weight, which is not the focus of current post-injury intervention. By completing this fellowship under the guidance of experienced mentors in a strong environment, the applicant will be prepared to launch a career as an independent scientist investigating consequences of musculoskeletal injury."
"9438445","Project Summary I am a physician-scientist with a primary research interest in the programming of respiratory diseases by prenatal/early-life environmental exposures, such as air pollution and maternal stress, with particular interest in the programming mechanisms at the maternal-fetal interface, i.e., the placenta. With research linking ambient air pollution to childhood respiratory disease, the goal of this proposal is to add to the growing research linking urban air pollutants, stress, and respiratory development by identifying sensitive windows of exposure and identifying novel mitochondrial and telomere biomarkers through which in utero exposures may be operating to impact future respiratory development.  Through formal coursework and expert mentoring, this award will enable me to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to become an independent transdisciplinary environmental health scientist and achieve my long-term career goals: to establish a competitive and successfully funded program to study the cumulative effects of environmental exposures (e.g., air pollution/stress) on the programming of biological mechanisms related to chronic childhood conditions. While this award focuses on respiratory outcomes, it is worth noting that the knowledge and skills obtained will be broadly applicable to a range of child health outcomes given the large number of childhood conditions with mitochondrial and telomere underpinnings (e.g., asthma, obesity, cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive outcomes). Specifically, I will 1) obtain training in air pollution and stress assessment in the context of a longitudinal cohort study design; 2) receive training and guidance in selecting and interpreting mitochondrial and telomere analyses; and 3) undergo extensive training in advanced quantitative methods (e.g. non-linear distributed lag models) to understand dose-response and temporal relationships between air pollution and health.  The proposed study will be the first to investigate windows of vulnerability to prenatal ambient air pollution exposure on child respiratory development and to investigate mitochondrial and telomere biomarkers in a target tissue (e.g. placenta) with respect to prenatal environmental exposures (e.g. ambient air pollution and stress) and early respiratory phenotypes. We will use daily air pollution exposures derived from a validated spatio-temporal modeling approach coupled with distributed lag methods to identify sensitive windows of air pollution exposure on respiratory phenotype. We will use state-of-art analyses of placental mitochondrial and telomere biomarkers that: 1) have been shown to be altered by environmental exposures; and 2) reflect cumulative oxidative damage over gestation. This study is also highly cost effective as we will leverage the resources of an existing well-phenotyped urban and ethnically-mixed pregnancy cohort [Perinatal Environmental and Development Study (PEDS)] with extant environmental exposure (air pollution and stress), covariate, and epigenome data."
"9444348","Project Summary  The main goal of this work is to improve image quality, particularly resolution, of flat-panel cone-beam CT (fpCBCT) systems. This modality is promising for its high resolution, adaptability to different geometries, and portability. In particular, fpCBCT is being investigated for use in bone-morphology quantification and microcal- cification detection, which are important in the study of osteoarthritis and detection breast cancer, respectively. These tasks require high resolution to visualize trabecular bone and microcalcifications, and while fpCBCT resolu- tion is superior to that of multi-detector CT, it is often unable to resolve these structures with sufficient detail. This work aims to improve resolution by modeling different system blur and noise properties, and incorporating these models in a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm. MBIR methods have been increasingly pop- ular in tomography due to their ability to generate higher quality images than traditional analytical methods. This is largely due to the fact that MBIR methods include a noise model, a feature lacking in analytical methods such as filtered backprojection. A MBIR method with an accurate flat-panel-specific mathematical model will result in higher spatial resolution reconstructions. The following sources of blur will be measured and modeled on multiple fpCBCT test benches: the extended X-Ray focal spot, the detector scintillator, detector lag, and gantry motion. Noise correlation resulting from these blurs or readout electronics will also be measured and modeled. Particular attention will be paid to the shift-variant nature of these blurs which, along with noise correlation, has been tradi- tionally overlooked in current CT and fpCBCT reconstruction methods. These models will balance accuracy with computationally efficient so they may be used in iterative methods. Novel MBIR methods will be developed to in- corporate a wide range of system models, including those developed in this work. These algorithms will be used to reconstruct data acquired in simulation and on multiple fpCBCT test benches. The importance of each blur/noise model will be evaluated with a range of system properties and acquisition settings. Data will be reconstructed using the new, more accurate methods/models and traditional methods/models for comparison. Image quality will be assessed using a variety of metrics, including resolution, spatial noise, segmentation quality, modulation transfer functions, and noise power spectra. For example, the ability to segment trabecular bone will provide a clinically relevant image quality metric. Thus, this work will result in novel MBIR methods, detailed models of blur and noise correlation applicable to many fpCBCT systems, and a detailed analysis the image quality improve- ments resulting from these methods. While this work will focus on high-resolution imaging of bone morphology, it will improve the ability of fpCBCT to accomplish other high-resolution clinical tasks by improving resolution in current systems. Additionally, this work will provide a software solution to hardware induced image quality limita- tions, providing avenues not only to extend imaging performance in currently available system, but also to provide improved trade-offs and a way to relax hardware constraints in the design of future fpCBCT systems."
"9541628","Summary ? Core C  Lack of animal models that accurately mimic human enteric disease limits studies of  pathogenesis in the GI tract. Furthermore, elucidating the role of the microbiome in  protecting against or exacerbating an infection is complicated by the fact that the  commensal microbiota in model animals such as mice, rats, and hamsters are very  different from those found in humans. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop and  validate novel pre-clinical models of human enteric disease that more accurately model  natural host-pathogen interactions, particularly those in which the impact of the  commensal microbes can be evaluated.  One strategic mission the Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research at  Baylor College of Medicine is adopting and developing idealized model systems to study  host-microbe interactions. The enteroid model is provocative in terms of providing the  ability to study host-microbe interactions at a systematic level and incorporating a variety  of host and/or commensal perturbations. Development of the enteroids provides an  exciting opportunity to advance our understanding of how pathogenic as well as  beneficial microorganisms interact with and induce responses from the intestinal  epithelium. The goal of the Genomics and Microbiome Core is to provide a centralized  facility to meet the comprehensive microbiome needs of all of the investigators involved  in this NAMSED proposal and to enable NAMSED investigators to test the hypothesis  that commensal microbiota are involved in enteric disease susceptibility and/or  protection. Therefore, the long-range objectives of the Microbiome Core are to: (1)  characterize how pathogen infection of enteroids impact host and (2) microbe  transcription; 3) determine whether enteroids can maintain colonization with individual  and communities of commensal microbiota; and 4) characterize how enteroid-  association impacts commensal microbiota gene expression. This integrated facility will  be cost effective and will ensure reproducibility of genomic, metagenomic, and  metatranscriptomic data generated in each of the proposed projects."
"9616907","The mission of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCCC) is to advance cures and means of prevention for pediatric cancer: the leading cause of disease-related death in children aged 1 to 14 years. For 36 of our 50 year history, we have pursued this mission with the support of a Cancer Center Support Grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We remain the only NCI designated Cancer Center that is dedicated solely to the research and treatment of pediatric malignancies. As such, we serve as a national and international resource for health care providers, children with cancer, and their families. Through the support of the American Lebanese and Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), a separate corporation whose sole purpose is to raise money in support of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), patients are accepted without regard to race, religion or ability to pay. Seventy-five percent of the total institutional space and annual budget are invested in the SJCCC. The current application proposes five multidisciplinary research Programs that are organized with the specific intent of translating basic science discoveries into curative therapies for children with cancer, while minimizing long-term side effects: our three disease-oriented Programs focus on Developmental Biology and Solid Tumors (DBSTP), Hematological Malignancies (HMP), and Neurobiology and Brain Tumors (NBTP); our Cancer Prevention and Control Program (CPCP) strives to improve the quality of life of individuals surviving childhood cancer; and our new Cancer Genetics, Biochemistry and Cell Biology Program (CGBCBP), formed by merging our two prior basic laboratory research Programs, embeds basic cancer research within the heart of the SJCCC, facilitating direct interaction between the disease-oriented Programs and the major laboratory resources in the Center. Research by the 144 aligned members is supported by 10 Shared Resources and an outstanding clinical research infrastructure. During the previous funding period, a new Director was appointed and several enhancements were made to the overall structure, policies, and procedures of the SJCCC. 32,522 clinical trial enrollments occurred at the Center during the current funding period, of which 56% were to SJCCC investigator initiated studies. External peer reviewed trials, many which are SJCCC member-led, accounted for another 38% of enrollments. SJCCC members published more than 2,100 manuscripts during the funding period, and in the last 12 months were supported by $69.4 million in extramural funding ($57 million, peer-reviewed; $12.4 million, non-peer-reviewed)."
"9546154","Abstract  Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading causes of cancer-related deaths in both men and women and is one of the most lethal malignancies with a 5-year survival rate of ~8% and median survival duration of fewer than six months. Our long-term goal is that an understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) of the metastatic phenotype and pro-inflammatory/pro-angiogenic tumor milieu and its judicious manipulation can improve the treatment outcomes for PC patients. PC is frequently associated with oncogenic K-ras mutations (90-95%). Our preliminary data and published reports suggest that CXCR2 and its ligands regulate the behavior of tumor cells and recruitment of leukocytes, and endothelial (ECs) precursor cells. Limited literature exists on the role of Kras-driven CXCR2-dependent signaling in the de novo pathogenesis of PC. Thus, molecules driving a tumor-associated pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic phenotype have considerable potential as therapeutic targets, yet this area remains relatively under-explored in PC. To our knowledge, very little is known about the role of K-ras-driven CXCR2-dependent de novo PC development and impact of CXCR2 targeting in pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis. Our central hypothesis is that oncogenic Kras-induced expression of CXCR2 ligands plays a critical pro-tumorigenic role in inflammation-driven spontaneous tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and metastasis. A corollary to this hypothesis is that CXCR2 and its ligands are potential novel anti-tumorigenic and anti-metastatic therapeutic targets in PC. We will explore the role of CXCR2 and its ligands using xenogenic transplant models and autochthonous animal models (K- ras-driven) in PC pathology and develop a novel therapeutic strategy. To test our hypothesis, we will: 1) Define the mechanism by which K-ras-induced CXCR2 ligands expression promotes tumorigenesis and recruit pro- inflammatory and angiogenesis promoting precursor cells; and 2) Assess the therapeutic efficacy of targeting CXCR2-mediated mechanisms in pancreatic cancer treatment. Together, these studies will provide a mechanism for K-ras-dependent expression of CXCR2 ligands, delineate their role in PC pathobiology and assess their potential as therapeutic targets. With pharmacologic inhibitors of CXCR2 already in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory disorders, the rapid development of innovative cancer therapies targeting CXCR2 in combination with conventional anti-tumor regimens is a highly attractive option for making inroads in lethal PC. 1"
"9292723","Background: Almost half of Veterans with localized prostate cancer (the most common non-cutaneous malignancy among US men) receive inappropriate, wasteful imaging. The VHA Blueprint for Excellence prioritizes increasing operational effectiveness. Prior studies seeking to limit inappropriate imaging did not assess barriers and achieved mixed results. Our team has explored the causes of guideline-discordant prostate cancer imaging and found that 1) patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer have little concern for radiographic staging but rather focus on treatment, 2) physician trust imaging guidelines but are apt to follow their own intuition, fear medico-legal consequences, and succumb to influence from colleagues who image frequently. In spite of such discrepant v iews, most VHA physicians suggested or supported a large-scale effort to improve imaging use across VHA. Intervention: We propose a multi-site, stepped wedge, cluster-randomized trial to determine the effect of a physician-focused behavioral intervention on VHA prostate cancer imaging use. The multi-level intervention, developed according to the Theoretical Determinants Framework, combines traditional physician behavior change methods with novel methods of communication and data collection. The intervention consists of three components: 1) a system of audit and feedback to clinicians informing individual clinicians and their sites about how their behavior compares to their peers? and to published guidelines 2) a program of academic detailing with the goal to educate providers about prostate cancer imaging, and 3) a CPRS Clinical Order Check for potentially inappropriate imaging. The intervention will be introduced to 10 participating geographically-distributed study sites. Analysis Plan: We will assess imaging rates 6 months prior to the intervention and 3 months following the intervention. The study?s specific aims seek to understand the effects of the intervention on 1) facility-level prostate cancer imaging rates, 2) physician experience with and perceptions of the intervention and its implementation, and 3) the costs of both implementing the intervention and affecting change in imaging use. These aims will support a subsequent intervention to improve guideline-concordant imaging across VHA. Experience gained through this project will be leveraged to improve guideline-concordant care and increase operational effectiveness in other domains. Importance: This project seeks to describe and analyze the implementation of a behavioral intervention to improve prostate cancer care. This theory-based intervention builds on prior work identifying barriers to guideline-concordant prostate cancer imaging in VHA (CDA 11-257) and addresses these at three levels: individual (audit and feedback with VHA Cancer Care Cube data), facility (academic detailing) and system (CPRS Order Check). The team will assess the intervention?s cost impact and providers? experiences in preparation for a subsequent large -scale VHA implementation project optimizing the operational effectiveness of prostate cancer imaging across VHA. The current application is an opportunity to leverage VHA?s state-of-the-art, integrated healthcare delivery system to implement a carefully designed, theory-based behavioral intervention to reduce harmful, inappropriate care, increase appropriate care to those who truly need it, and simultaneously save money for the healthcare system."
"9432540","PROJECT SUMMARY Research findings from the breast cancer and environment research program (BCERP) have implications for reducing breast cancer risk later in life for adolescent girls. Supported by the precautionary principle, risk reduction activities include reducing exposures to certain chemicals (e.g., BPA, PFOA) and maintaining a healthy weight through exercise and diet, particularly during pubertal development, a window of susceptibility. Research efforts are necessary to understand effective mechanisms for communicating risk reduction recommendations to parents/caregivers so they can learn about and engage in risk reduction activities. Pediatricians, pediatric nurses, nurse practitioners, and family physicians are health care providers who comprise a key audience who can reach parents/caregivers as well as adolescents with risk reduction recommendations. Using a transdisciplinary approach that includes a Scientific and Community Partner Advisory Board, this research aims to build on the previous translational and communication science research of the investigators. Specifically, this project will: 1) assess the efficacy of the BCERP toolkits tailored for health professionals through formative research with pediatric health care professionals and assess the knowledge and information provision preferences of parents/caregivers using focus group interviews; 2) based on pediatric health care professional and parent/caregiver feedback, adapt BCERP toolkit content into engaging, motivational education and training modules that can be delivered either in-person or via an online, immersive experience to PHCPs; and 3) test the preliminary efficacy and feasibility of the two delivery mechanisms with PHCPs. This research will provide evidence for the effectiveness of using PHCPs as advocates for the early adoption of breast cancer risk reduction activities for adolescent girls."
"9479116","ABSTRACT To contain the HIV epidemic in Kenya and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, innovative strategies for identifying and treating HIV-infected persons who inject drugs (PWID) are critically important. It is also essential that factors contributing to onward transmission are better understood if prevention and treatment programs are to be brought to scale for key affected populations. The study will be co-led by Dr. Carey Farquhar and Dr. Joshua Herbeck and is a collaborative effort between the University of Washington, Kenyatta National Hospital, the University of Kwa-Zulu-Natal, Kenya Ministry of Health and a local NGO, Support for Addiction Prevention and Treatment in Africa (SAPTA). The study will determine whether assisting HIV-infected PWID to notify their partners can be a successful strategy for HIV testing and linkage to care, and whether assisted partner notification services (APS) can be leveraged to identify individuals at high risk for hepatitis C (HCV). The primary objective is to determine how many needle-sharing and sexual partners per HIV-infected PWID accessing HIV testing services can be tested, diagnosed HIV- or HCV-positive, linked to appropriate services, and engaged in care at 3 months post-testing. To achieve this, health advisors experienced in APS will recruit and enroll 1000 HIV-infected participants at 3 needle-syringe program clinics in the Mathare slum area of Nairobi. Together with peer educators from SAPTA, study health advisors will inform partners of the exposure to HIV and HCV and arrange for testing at the clinic or another venue. This strategy has not been used among PWID for HIV or HCV, however, it has recently been shown to be acceptable and feasible in the general population in Kenya. Our second and third aims leverage the ability of APS to identify new HIV and HCV cases and use phylogenetics to characterize modes of transmission and risk factors for ongoing HIV and HCV transmission in this key population. Blood spots will be collected on filter paper from 1000 HIV-infected and 1000 HCV-infected PWID in the network and HIV and HCV will be sequenced at the University of KwaZulu-Natal research laboratory. This type of molecular epidemiology approach has not been used in this population for HIV or HCV and holds great promise when combined with collection of sociodemographic and behavioral data for defining population level factors contributing significantly to onward transmission of these two viruses. We anticipate that our results will shape the success of future prevention efforts in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa by enabling public health programs to target high-risk clusters, and this will in turn pave the way for more in-depth research on effective screening and service delivery PWID."
"9470722","PROJECT SUMMARY Viral replicons, or self-replicating RNA elements incapable of initiating a spreading infection, are traditionally packaged into virus particles, termed viral replicon particles (VRPs), for in vivo delivery. Alternatively, they can be encoded on a plasmid DNA and transfected for host cell nucleus-mediated launch of replicating RNA. However, concerns of anti-vector immunity with respect to the former, or genome integration in the latter approach has limited the clinical use of such technologies. Furthermore, the development of VRPs has been restricted to larger viruses that are capable of harboring additional genetic cargo. With improvements in the delivery of naked RNA, there are now opportunities to develop new viral replicons without the constraints provided by traditional delivery paradigms. By utilizing replicons derived from diverse positive- strand RNA virus families, we can exploit the various mechanisms used by the host to detect replicating viral RNA as well as the differential mechanisms of immune evasion utilized by the parental virus, to rationally design vaccines. We propose studies that will elucidate the minimal genetic elements derived from a small positive-stranded RNA animal virus that are required to replicate and express a heterologous gene from a subgenomic transcript. We will then demonstrate the translational applications towards vaccine development for Zika and tuberculosis, viral and bacterial diseases with significant public health consequences. Furthermore, we will perform comparative studies between this platform with existing platform technologies derived from other positive-strand RNA virus families with the hypothesis that each will elicit distinct innate and adaptive immune responses due to evolutionary differences of the parental viruses."
"9493647","Abstract The goal of this High-End Instrumentation proposal is to enhance the molecular imaging capabilities of the University of Wisconsin Waisman Brain Imaging Laboratory (WBIL) and update our positron emission tomography (PET) imaging system. We are requesting funds to purchase the Siemens Biograph Horizon PET/CT scanner to replace our existing 17 year old scanner that is no longer vendor-supported. This commercially available system was selected based upon its state-of-the-art PET component and a more economical CT component (used exclusively for attenuation correction for our neuroimaging research). This system has an extended axial field of view (22cm) which provides an overall increased detection sensitivity, along with a more uniform sensitivity over the volume of the brain. This will result in dramatically improved SNR compared to our existing system. There are currently 9 major NIH-funded projects by University of Wisconsin investigators utilizing PET imaging as a primary outcome measure. These are heavily focused on measuring changes in amyloid and tau burden as presymptomatic biomarkers for Alzheimer?s disease using longitudinal study designs. Detecting these subtle changes (<10%) in amyloid and tau binding over the course of several years requires a stable, reliable and quantitatively accurate PET system over a long term. The Horizon PET/CT system will be 100% dedicated to research applications to overcome the challenge of integrating these multi-scan protocols into the schedule of a clinical scanner. UW researchers have directed a tremendous amount of resources into creating invaluable subject populations and we are now well-positioned to fully exploit the powerful PET molecular imaging measures in our investigations of neurodevelopment and neuropathology. This new PET/CT will ensure our future for uninterrupted acquisition of high quality data for this important research."
"9608145","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer therapy-induced ovarian failure is a significant public health problem with potentially 1% of population being affected over reproductive life span. Our overall goal is to understand and prevent the damage caused by such treatments. In the previous grant period we made significant discoveries which set the tone for the next grant period. We discovered that gonadotoxic chemotherapeutics result in primordial follicle death primarily by causing double strand (DSB) DNA breaks, and in response to this insult, oocytes mount an ATM- mediated DNA DSB repair response (Aging, 2011). This response may enable some primordial follicles to survive chemotherapy. Furthermore, we found that DNA DSB repair response is critical in the way oocytes mitigate genotoxic insult and aging, and that women who are deficient in DNA DSB repair, specifically BRCA1- mutation carriers, maybe prone to prematurely depleting their ovarian reserve (Science Translational Medicine, 2013). In addition, we showed that S1P, a naturally occurring ceramide death-pathway inhibitor, reduces chemotherapy-induced primordial follicle death in human ovarian xenografts (Human Reproduction 2014). Stemming from these revelations and the DNA DSB repair response being the unifying theme, our specific aims for the renewal application are: 1. To determine if BRCA-mutation carriers are more prone to chemotherapy-induced ovarian follicle loss because of their inherent deficiency of DNA DSB repair; 2. To reveal the mechanisms by which some primordial follicles are able to survive chemotherapy insult; 3. To understand how S1P protects human ovarian primordial follicle pool. To achieve these aims we will utilize clinical studies, single cel real time PCR as well as microarray strategies, in situ hybridization, gene interference, coupled with human ovarian xenografting and laser capture approaches. While the studies are primarily translational and will utilize human material, mouse models will also be used to strengthen the mechanistic work."
"9450457","Project Summary/Abstract A poor understanding of the heterogeneity of many complex diseases prevents their accurate early diagnosis and targeted interventions focused on etiology. Of particular concern, many subtypes exist among persons in the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, each subtype with distinct contributing causes and phenotypes. Accurately diagnosing and predicting rates of progression for these illnesses will be essential for any disease-modifying treatments. To overcome this barrier, we believe it is critically important to develop and apply an innovative method of latent class analysis -- incorporating both (1) the longitudinal trajectories of a high-dimensional collection of clinical and biomarker information, and (2) the times to specific outcomes when such data are available -- in order to arrive at subclassifications that are relevant to the underlying etiologies and the rate of disease progression. Unlike current methods of latent class analysis, our new method is scalable and requires minimal modeling assumptions. Over the short-term, we will target the heterogeneity of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the first clinically detectable manifestation of the intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia. We will integrate the information in two existing longitudinal data sets of persons with MCI: the National Alzheimer?s Coordinating Center?s Uniform Data Set (UDS), a unique resource with 29 participating NIH-funded Alzheimer?s Disease Centers contributing standardized clinical and neuropathological variables on over 6500 unique MCI individuals; and the Emory Neurology-Cognitive Data Set (NeuCog), which addition to comprehensive clinical information also contributes standardized biomarkers on 1015 unique MCI individuals with MRI scans and 529 with cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) specimens. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Develop a scalable method of latent trajectory class analysis that allows the researcher to model only the means, variances, and temporal correlations of the longitudinal observations; (2) Extend the method developed in Aim 1 for researchers to incorporate the times to specific clinical or neuropathological outcomes, subject to complex survival features, into the latent class analysis; (3) Apply our new statistical methods under the guidance of expert clinical scientists, using the information available in the UDS and NeuCog data sets, to identify clinicopathologically relevant subtypes of MCI; and (4) Develop freely available software to analyze data using our new statistical methods."
"9522332","PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4.

"9560012","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disseminated C. albicans infection in patients who have a weakened immune system is life-threatening. In hospitals 40% of bloodstream infections (candidemia) are caused by Candida spp. Despite the availability of several anti-fungal drugs, invasive candidiasis still has a high mortality rate ranging from 45 to 75%. The high morbidity and mortality associated with disseminated candidiasis are mainly due to the lack of early and accurate diagnostic tools, the limited anti-fungal drugs, and the emergence of drug resistance, thus highlighting the need to further understand host-pathogen interactions and the mechanisms of immune resistance to fungal spread, and to develop alternative immune-based strategies to combat candidemia. In normal hosts, C. albicans is controlled after activation of innate immune cells via cell surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLR2 and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) that detect the infecting fungi. The CLRs Dectin-1 and Dectin-2/3 recognize C. albicans yeast cells and hyphae by binding to the surface ?-glucans and ?- mannans of the two fungal forms, respectively. Recognition of these molecules results in release of inflammatory cytokines from innate immune cells, which is critical for anti-fungal immunity. The mechanisms that control this CLR-mediated innate immune response to fungal infection are completely unknown. Our preliminary results showed that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Cblb-/- mice infected with C. albicans yeast and hyphae produce more inflammatory cytokines than do BMDMs from wild type (WT) mice. This response involves signaling via Dectin-1, -2, and/or -3 but not via the TLRs. This finding suggests that Cbl-b acts through the Dectin CLRs but not the TLRs in macrophages. Consistent with this notion, BMDMs from Cblb-/- mice have impaired Dectin-1, -2, and -3 degradation upon interaction with C. albicans yeast and hyphae. In support of this finding, Dectin-1 undergoes poly-ubiquitination in macrophages upon infection with C. albicans yeasts, whereas this ubiquitination is abrogated in BMDMs lacking Cbl-b. Furthermore, Cblb-/- mice are protected from infection with a lethal dose of C. albicans. Based on these results, we hypothesize that during C. albicans infection, Cbl-b is recruited to Dectin CLRs, and this targets Dectins for ubiquitination which dampens CLR-mediated innate immune responses against fungi. To test this hypothesis, we propose to determine (1) whether and how Cbl-b regulates Dectin down-modulation via protein ubiquitination in vitro; and (2) whether Cbl-b dampens host effective responses against C. albicans mediated by the Dectin family of CLRs. Successful completion of this project will reveal a previously unknown host defense mechanism and provide molecular insight into the host defense machinery and ultimately facilitate the identification of candidate targets for appropriate modulation of anti-fungal responses and therapeutic options."

"9473773","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Up to 15% of the population has hypomagnesemia which is associated with a higher risk of developing common disorders like diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. Urinary Mg2+ losses contribute to hypomagnesemia, but knowledge about renal Mg2+ homeostasis is very limited. This proposal seeks to improve our understanding of renal Mg2+ homeostasis. The major organ for regulated Mg2+ reabsorption is the kidney. The final urinary Mg2+ concentration is determined by the epithelial Mg2+ channel TRPM6 in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Uromodulin (Umod) is a possible new modifier of renal Mg2+ handling as Umod gene expression is increased in hypomagnesemic mice. Our preliminary data confirm urinary Mg2+ wasting in Umod knock-out (Umod-/-) mice. In addition, we found increased TRPM6 whole-cell current density and TRPM6 cell surface abundance with UMOD expression. Our overall objective of this application is to study the effect of the urinary protein UMOD regarding the regulation of the Mg2+ channel TRPM6. Our preliminary results raise a novel hypothesis that UMOD, secreted from TAL, upregulates TRPM6 activity in the DCT from the luminal side by impairing TRPM6 endocytosis, thereby increasing channel cell surface abundance and so enhancing tubular Mg2+ reabsorption. We hypothesize that in low Mg2+ conditions, tubular UMOD secretion increases which then enhances renal Mg2+ reabsorption via TRPM6 to mitigate Mg2+ losses. In aim 1, we will test this hypothesis in vitro by analyzing the mechanism by which extracellular UMOD regulates TRPM6 activity. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording and protein biochemistry in cultured cell expression systems, we will test if UMOD increases TRPM6 cell surface abundance by impairing TRPM6 endocytosis and examine which UMOD domains are required for TRPM6 regulation. In aim 2, we will test the role of UMOD regarding renal Mg2+ handling in vivo. We will examine by immunofluorescent imaging if urinary Mg2+ wasting in Umod-/- mice is due to decreased apical TRPM6 expression. To study if UMOD is part of a renal feedback mechanism responding to systemic Mg2+ changes, we will analyze the response of wild-type and Umod-/- mice challenged with normal, low and high Mg2+ diets. Given our experience in ion channel physiology, mouse physiology, TRP channels and UMOD, we are very well equipped to perform this study. The contribution of this work will be significant as renal Mg2+ regulation by a urinary protein represents a novel concept. We expect a positive translational impact of this project, as the proposed feedback mechanism targeting systemic Mg2+ homeostasis may provide a novel explanation for a predisposition for urinary Mg2+ wasting. As UMOD polymorphisms affect urinary UMOD secretion, we will test in a future R01 application in a human cohort if UMOD polymorphisms contribute to urinary Mg2+ wasting by decreased UMOD secretion and if these UMOD polymorphisms are associated with common disorders. We hypothesize that specific UMOD polymorphisms reduce an individual?s adaptability to adjust to low Mg2+ conditions which could provide a link between hypomagnesemia and common disorders."
"9444359","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Calcific aortic vascular and valvular diseases (CAVD) carry a high mortality, yet no medical treatment is available. An exciting possibility is that intermittent parathyroid hormone (iPTH) treatment, currently used for osteoporosis, may offer therapeutic potential for CAVD, given that there is an age-independent, inverse relationship between bone formation and CAVD. Indeed, in an animal study, iPTH was found to prevent initiation of CAVD. However, the effect of iPTH in subjects with pre-existing CAVD is still not clear. Since CAVD is widespread and especially prevalent in the population requiring iPTH treatment, it is crucial to determine whether iPTH is still beneficial or even harmful in those wit pre-existing CAVD. Of note, in contrast to continuously high serum PTH levels, which promote bone loss and CAVD, intermittently high levels produced by daily injection of PTH, promote skeletal bone formation. Recent developments suggest an unexpected link between iPTH and oxidant stress, a known contributor of CAVD. Studies by others in osteoblasts and our preliminary findings in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) show that iPTH reduced cellular oxidant stress, suggesting a direct receptor-mediated mechanism. A second mechanism is also suggested by our recent report showing that, in hyperlipidemic mice, iPTH reduces circulating levels of proinflammatory lipid oxidation products (oxylipids) by inducing serum paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activity. Based on these findings and our previous work showing that oxylipids promote CAVD, we hypothesize that, iPTH will attenuate pre-existing CAVD and will do so, in part, directly by reducing levels of cellular oxidant stress and, in part, indirectly by reducing circulaing levels of oxylipids via PON1. We propose 3 Aims. In Aim 1, iPTH effects will be tested on pre-existing CAVD in hyperlipidemic mice. Since calcific plaque contains two potential targets of iPTH action, VSMC and preosteoclastic macrophages, iPTH may attenuate CAVD by inhibiting osteochondrogenic differentiation and/or by inducing mineral resorption. We will assess: 1) aortic calcium deposition by in vivo 18F¯ microPET-microCT imaging, which allows serial scanning of individual mice and 2) oxidant stress and osteochondrogenic and osteoclastic differentiation by levels of regulators and markers. In Aim 2, the iPTH sites of action will be determined. The systemic mechanism will be assessed using PON1- deficient mice (Pon1-/-ApoE-/-), and the direct mechanism will be assessed using vascular deficient PTH receptor 1 mice (Pth1r?VSMCApoE-/-). In Aim 3, we will employ a novel transplant technique, in which diffusion chambers carrying mutated 1°murine VSMC will be implanted subcutaneously into host mice, and we will test: 1) contributions of iPTH vs. endogenous PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) on calcification and 2) effects of iPTH in the context of low bone turnover osteoporosis of diabetes. The findings will reveal whether iPTH is a treatment or a risk for CAVD in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and how iPTH signaling achieves vascular-specific effects."
"9559066","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetic foot ulcers are extremely costly and debilitating. The cost of care doubles in patients with diabetic foot ulcers compared to patients without ulcers. Even if an ulcer heals, there is a 30%-40% risk there will be a recurrence within one year, so the problem is not likely to go away once it has started. The presence of ulcers and the potential necessity of an amputation both lead to dramatic decreases in both the quality of life and overall health of people with diabetes. The biomechanical and physiological etiology of diabetic ulceration is associated with damaging magnitudes of plantar pressures, shear forces and temperatures within inadequate or ill-fitting footwear. Prevention strategies are needed that target all of these modifiable factors. However, to- date, commercially available clinical systems used to measure the plantar surface only capture plantar pressures, and do not quantify shear forces or temperature of the environment. Currently, if interventions or advanced orthotics are designed to target skin-damaging shear forces and temperatures, these attributes cannot be measured to validate and test the effectiveness of the intervention. To fill this considerable gap in available technology in the care of diabetic patients, RTC Electronics, Inc. has developed a unique, patented Multi-Capacitor Sensor Array (MCSA) technology (Issued Patents #US7,343,813 B1 and US9250143 B2) that can sense both axial and shear forces, quantify temperature, and can be fabricated on very thin flexible substrates to fit within the footwear. The overall goal of the technology development proposed by RTC Electronics, Inc. is to develop a superior planter surface and foot function analysis system for clinical use to aid in the evaluation of orthotics and interventions that prevent diabetic foot ulcers. The specific goal of this application is to complete the initial development of our in-shoe axial and shear force, pressure, and temperature sensor, complete a thorough validation of the sensor, and to gather feedback from the clinical end-users of the system on current and future design factors."
"9416916","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The breakdown of T cell tolerance is a pinnacle pathogenic event in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and precedes the onset of clinical disease by decades. Molecular analyses of T cells supported by this project has led to the discovery that RA T cells are prematurely aged and that senescence supports proinflammatory effector functions. Recent work has connected maldifferentiation of RA T cells with abnormalities in their energy supply and metabolism. Metabolic abnormalities are present in naïve CD4 T cells, long before they participate in synovial inflammation, opening the intriguing possibility to prevent autoimmunity by metabolic interference. Naïve CD4 T cells in RA patients downregulate the glycolytic enzyme Phosphofructokinase 2 (PFKFB3) and upregulate Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD); therefore shunting glucose into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This metabolic abnormality leads to an oversupply of reductive elements (NADPH) and consumption of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in defective oxidant signaling. Mostly affected is the redox-sensing protein kinase Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which controls cell cycle behavior. With ATM insufficiency, RA T cells hyperproliferate, loose quiescence and make an early commitment to IL-17 and IFN-? production. This project will define molecular mechanisms that connect metabolic and functional abnormalities in RA T cells, with the aim to identify actionable diagnostic and therapeutic targets. We have developed a panel of pharmacologic and genetic manipulations to mimic PPP overutilization in human T cells, enabling a mechanistic exploration of T cell metabolism and function. Specific Aim 1 will seek to understand how glucose shunting into the PPP, accumulation of NADPH and loss of ROS affects T cell differentiation, survival and senescence; with a special emphasis on the induction of disease- relevant T follicular helper cells and Treg cells. Specific Aim 2 will determine how metabolic reprogramming affects the interaction of T cells with B cells, osteoclast precursors and synoviocytes to clarify its impact on autoantibody production, bone erosion and synovial hyperplasia. In Specific Aim 3, we will examine the regulatory role of inflammatory signals in the glycolytic machinery, specifically in the induction and suppression of PFKFB3 and G6PD. Specific Aim 4 is designed to discover how oxidant signaling shapes T cell differentiation and lineage commitment. By focusing on ATM, AMPK and mTOR we will define relevant signaling pathways and identify small molecule reagents that can restore ATM and AMPK activation, thus restraining mTOR and mTOR-dependent inflammation."
"9477760","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette smoking dramatically changes the architecture of the airway epithelium relevant to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the major smoking-induced lung disorder, for which no disease-modifying therapies that reduce mortality are available. The major airway epithelial remodeling (AER) phenotypes induced by cigarette smoking are basal cell (BC) and mucous cell hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, reduced number of ciliated cells, shorter cilia, and decreased junctional barrier integrity. However, specific mechanisms responsible for common pathogenesis of smoking-associated AER phenotypes in the human airways are unknown. Based on the knowledge that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is altered by cigarette smoke, and our previous observations that EGFR is highly expressed in airway BC, the stem/progenitor cells of airway epithelium, and mediates squamous metaplasia and epithelial leak, we have further focused on the EGFR signaling as a central element in the pathogenesis of all major smoking-induced AER phenotypes. Our preliminary studies have shown that: (1) EGFR ligand amphiregulin (AREG) is up-regulated in the AER areas of the airway epithelium of smokers and COPD smokers; (2) smoking-associated factors (EGF, TGF-beta, cigarette smoke extract) induce AREG expression in vitro in airway BC undergoing squamous differentiation; (3) AREG, by acting on human airway BC in vitro, promotes AER phenotypes, including BC- and mucous cell hyperplasia, decreased ciliated cell differentiation and junctional barrier integrity; (4) AREG-induced effects are distinct from those evoked by EGF: EGF does not induce hyperplasia, while AREG induces delayed and sustained EGFR activation associated with the maintenance of the receptor on the BC surface; (5) AREG promotes its own expression in airway BC. These data led to central hypothesis of this study, i.e., that up-regulation and unique signaling of AREG in airway BC stem/progenitor cells mediate smoking-induced COPD-relevant remodeling of the airway epithelium. To test this hypothesis, 3 Specific aims are proposed. Aim 1. Identify the common molecular pathways activated in human airway BC by smoking-induced factors responsible for generation of AREG-producing cells and increased AREG expression in the human airway epithelium. Aim 2. Determine specific molecular mechanisms of AREG signaling in airway BC that mediate AREG-induced smoking-associated airway epithelial remodeling (AER) phenotypes. Aim 3. Evaluate the hypothesis that inhibition of mechanisms of AREG up-regulation and signaling in airway BC will prevent or suppress the development of smoking-induced airway epithelial remodeling (AER). If proven correct, this study will provide the basis for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat airway epithelial disordering in COPD by targeting smoking-induced AREG up-regulation and signaling in airway BC stem/progenitor cells."
"9441836","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, but the genetic risk factors for congenital heart defects and adult cardiac disorders are incompletely understood. Variation in distant-acting regulatory sequences (enhancers) is likely to contribute significantly to heart development and disease via regulation of gene expression. However, the genomic location and in vivo function of heart enhancers in the human genome remains largely unknown, hindering efforts to establish mechanistic links between enhancers and heart development and clinical cardiac phenotypes. Our laboratories have pioneered techniques for genome-wide enhancer identification by ChIP-seq and in vivo functional enhancer characterization via transgenic mouse experiments. Here, these techniques will be leveraged to address the pressing need for accurate annotation of heart enhancer location in the human genome and activity across heart developmental and disease states. Despite the general value of mouse models and in vitro studies of human cell lines, we have shown that there is significant divergence in sequence and functional conservation between human and mouse heart enhancers and that enhancer maps generated from specific cell lines capture a limited slice of the regulatory elements active in heterogeneous tissues such as the heart. The present proposal is aimed at characterizing heart enhancers and associated gene expression directly from human tissues representing different developmental stages and subregions of the fetal and adult heart, with the goal of generating datasets of significant value to basic and clinical cardiac research. We additionally propose to examine inter-individual variation in heart enhancer activity and gene expression, characterizing differences across healthy subjects and individuals with heart disease. In proof-of-principle studies, we have demonstrated the general feasibility and scientific impact of this approach. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1) we will perform ChIP-seq targeting enhancer- associated epigenomic marks to identify in vivo enhancers directly from comparisons of human heart tissues, including pre- and postnatal developmental stages, cardiac subregions, and major adult cardiac disease states. We will also perform transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq in the same samples. 2) We will perform at least 250 transgenic mouse assays to characterize in vivo activity patterns of candidate developmental and disease-relevant heart enhancers and study functional effects of putative deleterious non-coding sequence variation. Tested loci will be selected based on biomedical interest and will include community-nominated cardiac loci and risk variants. 3) We will present the results as an integrated community resource for heart genetics, providing a web portal for data browsing and download and molecular reagents and transgenic mice to enable downstream studies of regulatory sequences in heart development and disease. This research will reveal the regulatory landscape of human cardiac development, function, and disease, and will address the pressing national need for genomic resources to enable and accelerate the advancement of cardiac research.

"9447100","Infections with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), S. Paratyphi A and S. Paratyphi B are responsible for the vast majority of enteric fevers globally and are a major public health concern. Additionally, Salmonella spp are category B pathogens that have the potential to be used as bio-terror weapons. The overall goal of this application is to advance the development of cross-protective vaccines against enteric fevers by identifying humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (CMI) which might play significant roles in protection. A secondary overall aim is to provide data to validate the S. Typhi /S. Paratyphi A bivalent vaccine approach to vaccination against enteric fevers. The proposed studies will take advantage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and sera specimens obtained from subjects orally immunized with Ty21a and CVD 909 typhoid vaccines or with the attenuated CVD 1902 S. Paratyphi A candidate vaccine, from subjects challenged with wild-type (wt)-S. Typhi and wt-S. Paratyphi A and from typhoid and paratyphoid A patients in endemic areas. We will utilize the power of cutting edge immunologic platforms such as mass and conventional multichromatic flow cytometry analysis and sorting to characterize S. Typhi-, S. Paratyphi A-, and B-specific B([memory]) (BM), T [memory] ?, and T [regulatory] (T reg) responses, including   their patterns of cytokine production and homing/chemokine receptor expression using a systems biology like approach. We will also perform immunoprofiling studies to identify genome-wide cross-reactive proteins that elicit serum antibody responses. Specifically, we propose to test the following hypotheses:       (1) a defined set of CMI responses play a key role in cross-protection between S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi B infection in Ty21a-immunized subjects, (2) oral immunization of volunteers with an attenuated S. Paratyphi A vaccine strain (CVD 1902) or exposed to wt-S. Paratyphi A elicits a defined set of CMI responses against S. Paratyphi A antigens and infected cells that cross-react with S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi B antigens, and (3) oral immunization with the attenuated S. Paratyphi A CVD 1902 vaccine or exposure to wt-S. Paratyphi A (either in challenge studies or in endemic areas) elicits serum antibodies and BM, Beffector, and Breguiatory cells specific to S. Paratyphi A, as well as against Salmonella common antigens present in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi B.

"9468676","Project Summary/Abstract Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a pervasive public health problem that carries great personal and economic costs. Despite the serious nature of AUD, we lack a thorough understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in excessive alcohol consumption. Therefore, a significant goal for future research is to more precisely map the molecular and circuit adaptations that accompany escalated alcohol intake. Although there are several models that allow mechanistic investigation of how escalated alcohol drinking can alter brain circuits and signaling, this project will focus on the intermittent access (IA) to alcohol paradigm, as it reliably drives high levels of voluntary alcohol intake and withdrawal during alcohol deprivation. While numerous neurochemical systems have been identified as playing a role in AUD, one of the most promising leads for therapeutic intervention is the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and its endogenous ligand dynorphin (Dyn). The Dyn/KOR system is upregulated in both alcohol-dependent humans and rodents repeatedly exposed to alcohol. Further, Dyn/KOR signaling has been shown to contribute to escalated alcohol intake and negative-affective states associated with alcohol withdrawal. Consistent with the important role of the Dyn/KOR system in excessive alcohol intake, I have generated preliminary results that show pharmacological blockade of KOR suppresses escalated alcohol drinking in the IA paradigm. One possible brain region underlying this effect is the insular cortex (IC). Though the IC is a highly understudied brain region in the context of alcohol research, several studies have shown the IC is involved in alcohol self-administration and undergoes structural adaptations following high levels of alcohol intake. In my preliminary work, I have identified a discrete subpopulation of Dyn-expressing pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 of the IC (ICDyn) that are engaged by long-term IA to alcohol. In addition, I have found that Dyn decreases excitability in KOR-expressing layer 5 interneurons, and that long-term IA to alcohol increases excitatory drive in IC layer 5 pyramidal cells. This indicates that KOR signaling locally modulates layer 5 neuronal activity and IA to alcohol may induce plasticity within an ICDyn laminar microcircuit. The proposed experiments will thoroughly characterize how long-term IA to alcohol impacts this newly identified ICDyn microcircuit by integrating multiple converging electrophysiological, pharmacological, and optogenetic approaches. Using these approaches, I will map the connectivity of this ICDyn microcircuit and assess adaptations in basal excitability and Dyn/KOR signaling in the IC that accompany long-term IA to alcohol drinking. I will also localize KOR to distinct subpopulations of neurons in layer 5 of the IC using a multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization assay. By generating a greater mechanistic understanding of how this novel ICDyn microcircuit is impacted by escalated alcohol intake, I will inform future studies aimed at mitigating alcohol abuse and dependence. Ultimately, this proposal will identify a site-dependent, cell-specific, and signaling- selective mechanism that can be used for the targeted treatment of AUD."
"9533187","ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular diseases including aortic aneurysms are generally considered disease of the older population related to environmental factors and life style choices including smoking, and obesity caused by high fat and salt diets. However, 20 percent of individuals affected by thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissections (TAAD) have a heritable form, commonly attributed to mutations in genes that encode for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and growth factors that contribute to vascular wall integrity. While there are a number of genes now identified as containing causal mutations for inherited forms of TAAD, causal genes in 75% of families with this disease have not been discovered. We recently identified a family with TAAD with unknown etiology. Through whole genome sequencing, we identified a missense mutation in the lysyl oxidase (LOX) gene (c.893T>G encoding p. Met298Arg) that segregated with the aneurysm phenotype in the family. LOX is an extracellular enzyme that catalyzes the amine oxidation reaction for critical crosslinking and maturation of elastin and collagen- key ECM proteins in the vessel wall.  To understand the mechanism underlying Lox-associated aneurysmal disease, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system to introduce the human mutation into mice (M298R in humans, M292R in mice). Characterization of the vascular system in mice carrying the M292R mutation confirmed that the mutation does indeed lead to aortic aneurysm formation. Animals homozygous for the M292R mutation died within a few hours of birth due to ruptured aortic aneurysm. Animals heterozygous for the mutation, however, did not develop aneurysms at 3 months of age, but had fragmented elastic fibers in the aorta wall, suggesting that the mutant animals may be predisposed to develop vascular disease when exposed of injurious stimuli. In this proposal, we will utilize this M292R mouse model to characterize mechanisms leading to changes in the arterial wall and determine whether additional vascular wall stress will induce thoracic aortic aneurysms. Furthermore, we will identify mechanisms underlying altered LOX function caused by the mutation that ultimately leads to aneurysm formation. Identification of Lox as a causal gene for familial TAAD will not only allow us to screen for Lox during clinical genetic testing, but understanding the mechanism behind how the mutation affects Lox enzyme function will provide insight into potential therapeutic development."

"9648292","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonest cause of skin and soft tissue infections. Additionally, severe invasive S. aureus disease results in hospitalization with high mortality. An epidemic of S aureus infections has occurred in the United States in the past decade. The great majority of these infections are community associated and are methicillin-resistant, i.e. resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics with the exception of ceftaroline. A recent annualized US study of the incidence of invasive S aureus infections estimated 600 infections occurred per 100,000 population. Therefore, there may be 1.8 million cases of S aureus infections per year in the United States alone, more than 90% of which are SSTIs. This epidemic of S aureus infections has complicated treatment and focused efforts on prevention. Prevention of Staphylococcus aureus infections by vaccination has not been simple. A number of unsuccessful vaccine trials have evaluated the protective effect of several putative protective antigens in recent years including capsular polysachharides, lipoteichoic acid, isdB and clfA. Our proposal seeks to capitalize on new ideas about how to protect against S aureus disease. Specifically, we screen antigens in collaboration with Merck Laboratories, the Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard University, and several derived from immunologic evaluation of convalescent sera from experimental animals to characterize protective vaccine antigen in murine models of skin infections and invasive disease with the goal to identify an optimal protective antigen combination. Following its identification, the mechanism(s) by which the new combination vaccine works will be sought. Specifically assessed will be traditional production of opsonophagocytic antibody but also the selective recruitment of lymphocyte subsets and cytokine pathways. It is expected that our combination vaccine development protocol will offer new insight into strategies for protection against invasive disease and SSTIs."

"9528910","Project Summary The objective of this exploratory research is to create a high-?delity tool to analyze cortical tension and cell-cell adhesion in their co-active states. These properties and their coupling play ubiquitous roles in the organization of cell aggregates, tissues, and cell clusters, in biological processes such as morphogenesis, cancer metastasis, and wound healing. They are the key cellular-level properties that affect and control the collective multi-cellular behavior, especially in regimes where strong bonds between cells and the extracellular matrix are absent or have not formed.  Experimental and systematic quanti?cation of these properties is nonetheless challenging, and more so than simply acquiring the apparent moduli of the cell cortex. In particular, both prior ?ndings and our preliminary results corroborate that the current techniques used to quantify cortical tension may have resulted in its appreciable alteration due to the interrogative force applied, and hence the acquired value does not re?ect that in the ?true and naïve? state. This proposal is developed to address this challenge.  Our rationale derives from a state-of-the-art understanding in single cell mechanics. We hypothesize that minimal impact to and faithful quanti?cation of the cell mechanical states can not be achieved unless one avoids the so-called soft glassy rheology (??uidized?) regime. This requires us to focus on the high frequencies or short timescales, known as the worm-like chain (WLC) regime. Collective knowledge in the ?eld suggests that in this regime we may be able to interrogate the cell cortex without appreciably modifying it. Our approach is formulated with two innovations: 1) A rapid deformation-relaxation analysis, combined with 2) simultaneous mechanical and ?uorescence quanti?cation of cell couplets. Our aims are:  Aim I To establish mechanical analysis via rapid electrodeformation-relaxation. We will develop the necessary experimental and analytical tools for such purpose, and validate our main hypothesis.  Aim II To interrogate tension-adhesion coupling by studying couplets. A couplet is a pair of cells bound to each other via adhesion, and is the ideal, minimal unit in which we can observe the co-action of tension and adhesion. We will combine the mechanical analysis in Aim 1 with ?uorescence imaging of both de novo and mature couplet cells stained for actin and N-cadherin observation. Both adhesion and tension will be modulated and their effects quanti?ed.  The success of this project will provide an innovative and convenient tool, and generate the much needed data on tension-adhesion coupling, for model building, mechanism-based understanding, and hypothesis validation, in broad ?elds where cell-cell mechanical interactions play essential roles."
"9474645","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rates of prediabetes and diabetes are increasing in the pediatric population, due to the epidemic of childhood obesity. Epidemiologic studies have linked prediabetes in childhood with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. Because children with prediabetes represent a high-risk group of individuals who may benefit from early identification and intervention, there is increasing interest in the use of biomarkers previously validated in adults for pediatric populations. The proposed study will evaluate the longitudinal test performance of an array of conventional biomarkers of glycemia, including Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and novel metabolomic biomarkers for identifying progression of glucose tolerance (normal to prediabetes or prediabetes to diabetes) in an overweight and obese pediatric cohort. In addition, a feeding study will also be conducted to examine variability in metabolomic biomarkers associated with abnormal glucose tolerance in response to macronutrient diet composition. The specific aims of this study are the following: Specific Aim #1: Assess whether conventional biomarkers of glycemia longitudinally predict progression of glucose tolerance (normal to prediabetes or prediabetes to diabetes) in a cohort of overweight/obese children. Specific Aim #2a: Identify novel metabolomic measures that longitudinally predict progression of glucose tolerance (normal to prediabetes or prediabetes to diabetes) and insulin resistance in a cohort of overweight/obese children. Specific Aim #2b: Evaluate the variability in metabolomic biomarkers associated with abnormal glucose tolerance in response to high carbohydrate and high polyunsaturated fat diets in an overweight/obese adolescent population. Application of the science of metabolomics to human disease risk is a major focus of the NIH's Roadmap for Medical Research. Although an increasing number of metabolomic studies have been conducted in adults, few studies have been conducted in children. This will be one of the first longitudinal studies to evaluate the predictive capacity of a comprehensive set of conventional and novel biomarkers for identifying adolescents with insulin sensitivity and progression of glucose tolerance status. The proposed research project represents a unique multidisciplinary collaboration of investigators with expertise in pediatric obesity and diabetes, diabetes epidemiology, metabolomics, human nutrition, and biostatistics, and will provide important information relevant for future pediatric screening policy, insights into the pathogenesis of prediabetes/type 2 diabetes during adolescence, and information on specific dietary interventions and their impact on the metabolomic 'at risk' profile."
"9663154","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early intervention to identify and treat chronic disease and modify behavioral risk factors among women of reproductive age has the potential to significantly reduce their morbidity and mortality and improve their pregnancy outcomes. Lack of health insurance has been a major barrier to early intervention and preventive care among low-income women of reproductive age. However, the 2014 expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will make millions of low-income women newly eligible for Medicaid and preventive health services. An integrated data system is essential to evaluate the impact of this expansion on the health of women of reproductive age and their infants. Research using this data system will inform future program planning and identify best practices and areas of greatest need. We propose to create an integrated data system that links Oregon Medicaid data with birth and death certificates and hospital discharge data. Further, we will include data on the quality of Medicaid services that are not available to other states. The proposed study is a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is an ideal state in which to conduct the proposed study because of its ongoing commitment to Medicaid health care delivery reform and the commitment of state leaders to collaborate across divisions and programs to ensure this project's success. The project also has the support of key state stakeholders in maternal and child health and women's health. The specific aims of the proposal are to1) develop a research agenda, in collaboration with key stakeholders, to evaluate the expansion of Medicaid on the health of Medicaid-eligible women of reproductive age, mothers, and infants in Oregon; 2) link Oregon Medicaid data for female enrollees ages 15-44 and their infants to statewide datasets, including (but not limited to) live birth, fetal death, infant death, and hospital discharge data, beginning with 2008 and continuing until 2016, as data become available; and 3) conduct planned analyses and disseminate findings. The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes."
"9541629","PROJECT SUMMARY  Rotavirus (RV) is the leading cause of life-threatening diarrheal disease in children under the age of 5, and  results in nearly half a million deaths annually, despite the use of two licensed RV vaccines. Although RV  vaccines are available, they do not work optimally in countries where they are needed most. Human  rotaviruses (HRVs) grow poorly in cultured cells and do not infect mice, which are only susceptible to animal  rotavirus infection. We do not understand how HRV infections cause life-threatening disease and question if  knowledge from existing animal models is fully applicable to HRVs. We pioneered establishing human  intestinal enteroids (HIEs) as novel ex vivo model ?mini-gut? systems to examine host-pathogen interactions  and pathophysiology. HIEs are self-organizing, 3-dimensional physiologically active, multicellular cultures that  mimic the ordered structure of the intestine. We have found that HRV strains replicate extremely well in HIEs  mimicking the host permissiveness observed in people, thus establishing a new model to study HRV infections  and pathogenesis. We propose studies to directly examine mechanisms of pathophysiology and genetic  control of HRV infection and growth. The recent discovery that cellular receptors used by HRV strains are  histoblood group antigens (HBGAs) resulted in a paradigm shift in thinking about the host's genetic influence  on RV infection and provides a new perspective on zoonotic transmission of rotaviruses. Unique differences in  HBGA expression may explain the higher prevalence of unusual HRV strains in Africa and lower vaccine  efficacy seen in distinct ethnic populations. We hypothesize that HRV infection of enteroids is genetically  restricted and permissive infection leads to novel intracellular and extracellular innate signaling and response  pathways that underlie HRV pathogenesis and pathophysiology. In addition, the outcome of HRV infection or  vaccination can be modulated by beneficial microbes. We propose studies in Aim 1 to determine whether  genetically-controlled modulators of susceptibility (HBGAs) and distinct innate responses in HIEs regulate HRV  infection and pathophysiology (with Cores B and C). Studies in Aim 2 will establish the effect of commensal or  pathogenic organisms on HRV or vaccine infection. These studies will elucidate the molecular basis for strain-  specific host range restriction observed in children of different ethnic groups and be relevant to understanding  vaccine properties. Furthermore, evaluation of modified HIE cultures that house human commensals,  probiotics or other pathogens (with Cores B, C and Project 2) in new tailored biomaterial platforms (with  Project 3) will lead to a better understanding of how epithelial responses to a viral infection are modulated.  Collectively, this work will provide a new understanding of rotavirus pathophysiology and the subsequent  critical adaptive responses in humans that trigger immunity and disease."
"9663153","ABSTRACT  This proposal is to enhance the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) site in Rochester, NY, which has for 10 years been focused on prospective, population-based surveillance for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) caused by rotavirus, norovirus, and other viral pathogens, and for the past year, population-based surveillance for acute respiratory infections. We propose to continue and extend surveillance for ARI with a focus on influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68), and other vaccine- preventable or potentially vaccine-preventable viruses, in order to both measure influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza infections among hospitalized children <18 years of age, and to assess the inpatient burden of viral pathogens associated with ARIs, particularly influenza, RSV and EV-D68. We also will continue the AGE surveillance to allow for similar determinations of AGE burden and rotavirus vaccine efficacy among children hospitalized or visiting the emergency departments.  The over-arching goal of the NVSN is to inform the nation about the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), and the impact of new vaccines and vaccine policies. Our Rochester NVSN site (a founding NVSN member), has been a leader in shaping all aspects of the NVSN, including population-based surveillance for new or upcoming vaccines, vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies, refinement of diagnostic laboratory methods, health services and epidemiologic studies, and dissemination of findings. We have the infrastructure and comprehensive expertise to begin all activities on day 1 of the funding period.  Our NVSN site has: experienced personnel who have led and published many past NVSN influenza VE, surveillance, and molecular diagnostic laboratory studies; accurate laboratory and surveillance techniques consistent with CDC procedures; and outstanding epidemiologic and health services research capabilities. We have full access to all hospital and ED databases to complement surveillance activities. Our catchment area, the Monroe County NY/Rochester Metropolitan Statistical Area, has a total population of >1,000,000; >95% of ARI admissions for Monroe County resident children <18 years of age occur at our two NVSN hospitals, with nearly 1,000 hospitalizations for ARIs per year. Thus, we have a ?captured population? precisely suited for the NVSN population-based surveillance projects. This proposal will provide critical information to develop sound polices consistent with national goals to preventing VPD in children."
"9540725","Project Summary: The Kansas City-New Vaccine Surveillance Network (KC-NVSN) program was established in 2009 to conduct population-based, laboratory-confirmed, active surveillance of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) illness in children seeking care at Children's Mercy Hospital, in Kansas City (KC), MO. The program was subsequently expanded in 2015 to include hospitalized ARI children in inpatient (IP) settings. In the current proposal, the KC-NVSN program seeks to continue the existing pediatric AGE IP and outpatient (OP) surveillance in the six county KC metropolitan area and ARI IP surveillance in Jackson County, MO. In addition, we will expand ARI surveillance to OP from Jackson County visiting the main CMH emergency department. Age and time matched healthy control children will also be enrolled. Eligible children visiting or admitted to our hospital system as defined above will be enrolled using permission and assent forms approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of CMH. We will conduct parent interviews, collect medical chart data and retrieve hard copies of vaccine information for influenza and rotavirus from enrolled children. Clinical specimens collected from children will be tested for rotavirus (and other GI pathogens, e.g. norovirus in proposed subprojects) in stool and 22 respiratory pathogens from respiratory specimen including specific influenza subtypes and other non-influenza viruses, such as RSV, EV-D68 etc. The data collected from the KC-NVSN program will provide population-based estimates to address the following specific aims: 1. To assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing medically attended rotavirus and influenza  illness by the test-negative case-control study design using laboratory confirmed testing among  enrolled children. 2. To assess the burden of select AGE pathogens and non-influenza viral pathogens, including  respiratory syncytial virus and EV-D68 among enrolled children. The KC-NVSN program will provide data to be combined with other geographically diverse sites to estimate the national incidence, burden, and etiology of community-acquired AGE and ARI. The VE for rotavirus and seasonal influenza vaccinations will be calculated to measure the impact of vaccination. This network will also address several important scientific questions related to natural history of pediatric infectious diseases, transmission dynamics, impact of vaccine on targeted and vulnerable population and factors that influence vaccine effectiveness. The surveillance data generated from this network will provide timely and highly useful data to inform public health measures and pediatric vaccine-related policies aimed at controlling AGE and ARI in US children."
"9438379","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic cigarette (EC) use has increased dramatically in recent years, especially among never smokers. We recently completed a survey of EC users in Baltimore and found that a surprising percentage of EC users are non-smoking young adults. The oral cavity is host to one of the most complex microbial floras in the human body, and disturbance in this equilibrium can lead to overrepresentation of pathogenic species. Alterations in oral host defense, including reductions in salivary flow and secretion of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines by salivary glands, epithelial cells, and immune cells, may create a hospitable environment for pathogenic bacteria, leading to oral diseases. Our recent report indicates that EC exposure increases oxidative stress and inflammation, hampers the innate immune response, and increases susceptibility to pulmonary bacterial infections in a mouse model, indicating a high potential for adverse effects to oral host defense. EC exposure also causes inflammation of the salivary gland ducts in this model. However, a mouse model for studying effects on oral health is not representative of human exposure because mice are obligate nose breathers. EC vapor exposure in cell culture is also not representative of human exposure. Furthermore, the development of oral disease requires many years of exposure. Thus, cross-sectional and longitudinal alterations to the host oral defense and microbiome, which are early markers of risk, as a result of chronic exposure to ECs in young adults needs to be deciphered. We hypothesize that chronic EC use in young adults impairs the oral host defense by increasing oxidative stress and cytokines, and reducing salivary flow, antimicrobial peptides and epithelial defensins, leading to oral microbial dysbiosis. Specific Aim 1. Community structure and functional characterization of the oral microbiome in young adult EC users. Using samples from a cohort of young adult EC users and controls (age, 18-34 years; N=100/group), structural and functional characterization of the oral microbiome will be performed by 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomics for (a) cross sectional comparison of EC users with non-users and (b) a longitudinal follow up of EC users at 0, 1, and 2 years. Data from this Specific Aim will demonstrate functional differences in oral microbiomes of EC users that correlate with mechanistic biomarkers of oral host defense, which may increase the risk for oral disease. Specific Aim 2. Mechanistic evaluation of oral host defense in EC users. Along with the microbiome assessment in Specific Aim 1, oral host defense will be assessed via (1) salivary gland function, including salivary flow rate and salivary gland-specific anti-microbial peptides; () epithelial/immune cell antimicrobial defenses, including secretion of anti-microbial peptides, cytokines, and oxidative stress; and (3) biomarkers of inflammation and oral health in saliva and buccal epithelial cells. The integrative analysis of Specific Aim 1 and 2 will fill a critical gap n our understanding of alterations in host oral defense and a potential microbial shift in EC users, which may predispose them to oral diseases; thus, providing the evidence-based foundation for future public health policies on EC use."
"9437757","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is characterized by unrestricted, self-renewing cells, eventually forming tumors that deprive healthy tissues of resources. Albeit in a controlled fashion, the ability to self-renew is shared by pluripotent stem cells and naturally present progenitors in the adult. This shared ability to self-propagate led to the hypothesis that progenitor cells may be more apt to transformation into cancer or apt to transform with distinct tumor phenotypes. Work in several tumor types (rhabdomyosarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, etc.) has confirmed the hypothesis, while results in brain cancer contradict. Recent work by other labs has established the presence of multipotent melanocyte progenitors within the epidermis of adult humans, opening up the possibility for melanoma genesis from a more pluripotent and less differentiated cell. Uncovering the importance of cell of origin will test the hypothesis that the ell in which melanoma arises dictates its subsequent clinical behavior; providing insights on treating malignant melanomas based on their cell of origin and not just the bulk population.  To address the impact of the differentiation status of the cell of origin on melanoma this study will utilize two complementary systems: human melanocytes derived from iPS cells and a transgenic zebrafish model of melanoma. We have generated a robust and repeatable protocol for the production of pigmented melanocytes via melanocyte progenitors from human pluripotent cells. We will introduce oncogenic mutations (including BRAFv600e) at defined stages of differentiation and characterize the tumorigenic phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. To complement the human cell culture work, we will utilize the well-established in vivo zebrafish melanoma model to drive tumorigenesis in cells at each progenitor stage. By expressing BRAFv600e under promoters for lineage specific genes we can query the importance of differentiation status of the cell of origin on melanoma phenotypes in vivo."
"9470409","Abstract Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) occurs frequently, ranking as the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Metastasis and recurrence result in a 5-year survival after surgery of around 20%. Therefore, there is a dire need for therapeutic strategies that can prevent metastasis and recurrence. The cancer stem cell (CSC) population is of growing interest, as accumulating evidence suggests these cells play a pivotal role in the ability of a tumor to seed a metastatic site and cause long term recurrence. Traditional chemotherapy drugs that target rapidly dividing cells often leave this subpopulation behind. In epithelial tissue, stem cell populations express high levels of the transcription factor p63. This p53 related protein is crucial for maintaining the undifferentiated stem cell phenotype of these epithelial cells. I propose that the CSC population of HNSCC is equally reliant on the expression of p63 to maintain the undifferentiated state. Understanding the exact isoform of p63 that is regulating this phenotype in CSCs and the pathways it controls, will provide new therapeutic targets for patients with this deadly disease. Preliminary data, along with previous work by our lab has implicated chromatin regulating proteins as key targets of p63 in epithelial tissue. Therefore, this proposal aims to elucidate the various chromatin regulators modulated by p63, that are essential for the survival of HNSCC CSCs, leading to new, lifesaving drug targets. Additionally, the work outlined in this proposal will help me develop new bench skills essential to furthering our understanding of cancer biology, including ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, flow cytometry, and the development of mouse models and CRISPR library screens. I will also benefit from additional career development including training in grant writing, written and oral scientific presentation, and student mentoring."
"9524028","Abstract Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are part of a heterogeneous and overlapping group of clonal diseases that arise in the hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells and also include acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and the hybrid MDS/MPN entities. Individuals with MDS have a high risk of progressing to leukemia, with approximately 30% expected to develop AML. Outcomes for MDS are poor, with 5 year relative survival estimates below 50%, suggesting that early detection and prevention could have a large impact. During our initial funding period, we conducted the first population-based case control study of MDS, including recruitment of over 550 cases. In this competing renewal application, we propose to capitalize on our well-characterized study population to investigate the contribution of genetic variation to MDS risk and to evaluate the role of the killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) on incidence and survival. Our specific aims are to: 1) Identify germline susceptibility variants for MDS through collaboration with the MDS Clinical Research Consortium; 2) Evaluate the relationship between KIR haplotypes and risk of MDS; and 3) Understand the role of KIR gene haplotypes in disease progression and survival, overall and by MDS subtype. We hypothesize that we will identify variants that predict MDS risk and that risk estimates will be larger in cases with high risk MDS subtypes who are more likely to progress to AML. We further hypothesize that KIR haplotype B will be identified at a lower frequency in MDS cases compared with population controls and that KIR haplotype A will be associated with worse prognosis. We will genotype germline DNA samples from 465 MDS cases from our case-control study, 200 MDS cases from Moffitt Cancer Center and 1,119 age- matched population controls using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5 array. We will use available genotyping data from 1,700 MDS cases from the MDS Clinical Research Consortium and 4,597 healthy controls for replication and meta-analysis. In order to improve our power to detect associations, we will restrict our analysis to regions of open chromatin in myeloid cells as determined by ATAC-seq of primary cell cultures. For Aim 2, targeted capture and sequencing will be used to measure variation in the 143kb region containing the KIR genes on chromosome 19 (position 5537984-55378670). We will compare the two main KIR gene haplotype blocks (A and B) in cases and controls. To evaluate the impact of KIR haplotypes on progression, we will treat the 457 confirmed MDS cases as a cohort and evaluate associations between KIR haplotype and progression to AML and survival. The role of common genetic variation is largely unexplored in MDS; however, the few studies that have been conducted provide a rationale for further evaluation. Identifying predictors of rapid death from MDS, such as KIR haplotypes or alleles, could provide clues to the underlying biology in this subgroup and suggest new avenues for therapy. Adoptive NK cell therapy is one such option that is already in development for treatment of hematologic malignancy."
"9373991","Summary Alcohol and drug abuse are key co-morbidities of HIV-1 infection. The advent of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) has greatly improved the life expectancy of HIV-1-infected individuals, and there has been shift in research from the study of the deleterious effects of addictive substances on the progression of HIV infection, to examination of whether the viral infection itself can lead to addiction. Using the HIV-1Tg rat model, we showed that the intensified addictive behavior in HIV-1Tg rats correlates with the presence of viral proteins and that chronic exposure to alcohol further enhances the novelty seeking behaviors associated with susceptibility to substance abuse. We recently employed CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to target and eradicate the HIV-1 genome from the chromosomes of infected cells. By targeting LTR sequences flanking the integrated HIV-1 pro-virus, we were able to completely excise the full length viral genome from latently infected cell lines. Similar results were achieved on in vitro infected PBMCs and CD4+ T cells derived from healthy donors as well as ex vivo cultured cells from HIV-1 positive patients. We combined multiplex gRNAs directed to different regions of the viral genome with AAV9-based delivery to show, for the first time, successful excision of viral sequences in a variety of tissues from HIV-1Tg mice and rats. The removal of the HIV-1 genome caused a significant drop in viral RNA expression in many tissues, including the blood, brain, and liver. Based on those data, we propose to utilize our gene editing therapy to correct the HIV-1- and alcohol-induced molecular and behavioral malfunctions in the HIV-1Tg rat model. The findings from these molecular and behavioral pre- clinical studies will set the stage for the development of gene therapies designed specifically to treat alcohol- addicted HIV-1 patients on cART."

"9496471","Project Summary Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with no known cure. We observed changes of gut microbiota in SLE, including a marked decrease of Lactobacillus spp., in both human and mouse. Our preliminary results showed that increasing Lactobacillus spp. in the gut is beneficial and attenuates SLE-like disease in mice. The goal of this proposal is to mechanistically define the role of a probiotic species, Lactobacillus reuteri (LR), that protects against SLE. Based on extensive preliminary observations, we hypothesize that LR attenuates lupus by strengthening the gut mucosal barrier and modulating the Th17-Treg response. In the proposed studies, we plan to achieve two specific aims to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 is focused on the impact of Lactobacillus spp. on the gut microenvironment in lupus mice. The hypothesis of this aim is that the probiotic bacteria strengthen the gut mucosal barrier by modulating the expression of tight junction proteins. Aim 2 is focused on the mechanism at the systemic level by which Lactobacillus spp. attenuate SLE. The hypothesis of this aim is that the probiotic bacteria attenuates SLE-like disease by increasing systemic TGFb and inducing renal Treg cells. The results of the proposed studies, upon translation to human disease, will identify the key events initiating the cascade that leads to human SLE, and enable development of new therapeutic targets necessary to generate treatments for the disease. Diet and probiotics/prebiotics, known to modify the gut microbiota, have the potential to become cost-effective components of SLE management strategies."
"9623468","4.4.7 Project Summary/Abstract  The central theme in this work is that critical spatial patterns exist in highly resistant cancer stroma and vascular density that inherently inhibit larger nanoparticle penetration into cancer, and that these phenotypes can be imaged in vivo. We will use in vivo diagnostic imaging, combined with ex vivo analysis to test this in pancreatic cancer, which has as well known drug penetration limitation. Specifically, we will quantify nanoparticle penetration in pancreas cancer, which has high stroma content and low vascular density. The analysis and prediction of efficacy will be quantitatively developed by methodological correlation of in-vivo and ex vivo images using Fourier spatial frequency analysis.  We will determine the characteristic spatial patterns of these tumor microstructures that present as barriers to nanoparticle transport, as assayed through in vivo/ex vivo studies. We have seen that these characteristic spectral features appear in high-field magnetic resonance imaging (HF-MRI) scans and micro-Computed Tomography (uCT) scans of tumors imaged within the ongoing nanoparticle project at DHMC. The scope of this project is to conduct a secondary analysis on the images that are being produced within these projects, with two specific aims. 1) We will directly correlate nanoparticle penetration and distribution to the Fourier spatial frequencies found in in vivo images by Fourier spatial frequency analysis in which we have demonstrated expertise. The in vivo images will be analyzed by correlating them with histological sections of nanoparticle distribution post-treatment. Tumors will be classified on two levels as either a high or low permeability to a specific nanoparticle formulation (to quantify the amount of agent delivered), and as having high or low isotropy (to quantify the dispersion of the agent). 2) We will then apply this characteristic morphology analysis to pre-treatment, pre-operative HF-MRI, uCT images, and analyze their value as a potential diagnostic classifier. We will use a Support Vector Machine Analysis to predict the permeability and isotropy of unknown tumors, and validate our results against experimental outcomes. An iterative strategy will optimize the predictive power of the method, and be used to distinguish between characteristic spectra that are good and bad classifiers.  The research will be produced using the unique software systems that we have designed during preliminary studies, and will be deployed on an analysis platform that can be integrated with the hospital- based DICOM and virtual pathology environment to allow clinical investigators to plan adjuvant therapies to promote nanoparticle efficacy. Several hundred high-quality scans are now available for analysis, which will be processed and reported on within the first year of funding. By year two, the established system is projected to be able to analyze images within a few minutes post-scan. These analysis methods will give us the key background needed to advance our fundamental understanding of nanoparticle in-vivo delivery, and test ways to interrupt transport barriers in interventional future work."
"9437796","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A better understanding of the liver's response to toxic injury, which includes hepatocyte proliferation, activation and differentiation of facultative hepaic stem cells (oval cells), and - unfortunately - an increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, is a prerequisite for the development of novel clinical treatments for chronic liver disease and improved cancer prevention. Likewise, cell replacement therapy, either through direct hepatocyte transplantation or in bio-artificial liver devices, needs to be improved in order to become a reliable alternative to liver transplantation. To date, investigations of hepatocyte proliferation have frequently focused on the partial hepatectomy paradigm, a noninjury model that is not reflective of liver injury in humans and which has therefore failed to identify specifi targets for either improved regeneration following toxic injury or for limiting proliferation in HC in humans. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine which genes and gene combinations promote or repress hepatocyte repopulation following toxic liver injury using an innovative genetic approach. In Specific Aim 2, we will employ expression of key hepatic transcription factors to improve the differentiation of hepatic progenitor cells to functional hepatocytes. Together, these approaches will provide an improved understanding of the liver's response to toxic injury, and facilitate the discovery of new cell replacement therapies to treat chronic liver disease and liver failure."
"9486908","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with severely damaged auditory nerves cannot benefit from cochlear implants. The goal of this project is to accelerate the translation of silicon-based, multisite, penetrating microelectrode arrays to a cochlear nucleus auditory prosthesis. We have recently made significant technological advances with our devices in the cat model, which together with high-count cables and feedthroughs will provide a unique opportunity to develop arrays of multisite microelectrodes that are suitable for clinical use. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of interfacing a multisite microelectrode array with a lare number of microstimualting sites to an implantable pulse generator (IPG), in preparation for a subsequent clinical trial. Validation of the cochlear nucleus implant for clinical use will also advance other configurations of silicon- substrate multisite microelectrode arrays toward clinical use. These include the auditory nerve and the auditory midbrain (inferior colliculus), and perhaps even the primary auditory cortex. We are proposing to conduct appropriate tests under two ISO (International Organization for Standardization) guidelines: (1) ISO 10933 in Aim 1 to validate the biocompatibility of the electrode array and associated cables, and (2) ISO 14708 in Aim 2 for interfacing the array and cable to a neurostimulator. In Aim 2, we will develop the interface to an IPG, and determine the compliance of the system in-vitro per ISO 14708 which specifies requirements for reliable interfaces to neurostimulators. These tests are a critical majo step to optimizing our devices for a future investigational device exemption by the FDA. The successful outcome of the project will be the translation of a new generation of multisite, penetrating silicon microelectrode arrays that will be implanted in a human cochlear nucleus, allowing for unprecedented access to the tonotopic organization of the nucleus.

We demonstrated that activation of TERT can reverse the mechanism of flow-induced endothelium-dependent dilation from H2O2- to NO, restoring the phenotype to one observed in subjects without CAD. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the role of mitochondrial specific effects of telomerase activity and whether the dominant negative splice variant ? del TERT is critical in this phenotypic change in dilator mechanism. Our central hypothesis is that mitochondrial DNA damage is one of the underlying causes that leads to increase in ROS production. mtROS is known to promote development of arteriolosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction predisposing individuals to vascular complications. NO has a well-known inhibitory effect on mtROS generation and has also been demonstrated to increase telomerase. Whether nuclear or mitochondrial telomerase activity contributes to cardiovascular protection is not defined. We developed novel inhibitors of nuclear (nucTERT) or mitochondrial (mitoTERTi) telomerase activity to differentiate the roles of nuclear and mitochondrial telomerase in mediating vascular protective phenotypes. We will identify the role of mitochondrial telomerase in this change of mechanism from health (NO mediation) to disease (H2O2 mediation) in mouse and human resistance vessels.  We hypothesize that mitochondrial telomerase plays a protective role by preventing mtDNA damage in normal conditions, while expression of ? del TERT in disease suppresses this protective effect and elevates vascular cellular oxidative stress, and induces the conversion from NO to H2O2 as the mediator of FMD. This will be tested by addressing two specific aims.  First, we will determine whether mitochondrial localization of TERT is necessary and sufficient to maintain NO rather than mtH2O2 as the mediator of flow-induced dilation in the human microcirculation. Second, we will investigate whether the mechanism by which CAD elicits a switch from NO to H2O2 as the mediator of FMD and impairs mitochondrial function involves accumulation of ?-del TERT. We will use existing pharmacological and genetic tools that will lead to strategies for restoration of microvascular function in disease. This novel hypothesis has important translational potential, identifying new therapeutic targets for moderating the pathological changes associated with microvascular disease."
"9537036","Viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route are among the most common human infections, but little is known about factors that influence transmission and viral replication in the intestine. The gastrointestinal tract is a complex environment and enteric viruses encounter a vast microbial community. Intestinal bacteria promote replication and pathogenesis of enteric viruses in mice, including poliovirus, reovirus, mouse mammary tumor virus, and norovirus. Thus, unrelated viruses from four families benefit from intestinal bacteria, highlighting the importance of understanding virus-microbiota interactions. Microbiota promote replication of enteric viruses through multiple mechanisms, including direct interactions with viral particles that aid attachment and stability, and indirect modulation of the host innate immune response. Although poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) are two closely related viruses in the Picornaviridae family, our data suggest that microbiota enhance their infection through distinct mechanisms. While inhibition of poliovirus replication requires a potent cocktail of four antibiotics, CVB3 replication is inhibited by much more subtle antibiotic regimens. These results suggest that CVB3 is more reliant on microbiota than poliovirus and that a specific subset of bacteria may be required for efficient CVB3 infection. Bacteria in the colon ferment dietary fiber to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. SCFAs are among the most abundant molecules in the distal gastrointestinal tract and influence intestinal metabolism and gene expression in ways that could impact enteric virus replication. Recently, we determined that a single bacterial metabolite, butyrate, is sufficient to promote CVB3 replication in microbiota-depleted mice. Our central hypothesis is that bacteria-derived SCFAs promote enteric virus replication by altering host gene expression and intestinal homeostasis. In this work we will 1. Examine the specificity of SCFA-mediated effects on enteric virus replication and 2. Examine how SCFA-mediated changes in host gene expression affect enteric virus replication. Overall, our goal is to use the power of model viruses to understand mechanisms by which bacteria promote enteric virus infection."
"9469828","Project Summary/Abstract The roots of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is responsible for 32% of all deaths in the U.S., can be found during the early years, beginning perinatally. Although psychosocial interventions in populations across a wide age range have been shown to improve behavioral, mental health, and physical health outcomes, the development of effective early CVD prevention strategies and a deeper understanding of the ways in which psychosocial family factors interact to promote or reduce CVD risk are needed. The proposed project will build on the Family Foundations (FF) intervention, an ongoing NICHD-funded (PI: Feinberg, HD058529) randomized controlled trial of a perinatal intervention focused on coparenting, to examine the psychosocial pathways within the family that influence child and parent CVD risk. Additionally, we will examine potential intervention effects of FF on child and parent CVD risk. As part of the proposed project, we will augment the planned home visits (N = 294 families) which include questionnaire and family interaction data collection by adding the collection of baseline blood pressure, dried blood spot samples for the assessment of metabolic and inflammatory CVD risk markers, and important potential moderators of CVD risk. First, using these data and taking advantage of data available from three previous waves of data collection, we will develop models of interactive psychosocial influences on parent and child CVD risk. Specifically, this will include the consideration of child factors (e.g., behavioral problems), parent factors (e.g., depression), and family climate factors (e.g., parenting quality, family chaos and conflict), which we expect to interact and also contribute to CVD risk in unique ways. Second, we will test the extent to which these child, parent, and family factors mediate any effect of the FF intervention on CVD. Third, we will examine whether key external risk factors (parents? lifetime socioeconomic status (SES) and adversity and children?s lifetime SES and birth weight) moderate any associations between child, parent, and family factors and CVD risk and whether they moderate main effects of the intervention on CVD risk. This research will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of scientists who specialize in intervention research, psychosocial influences on health, minimally invasive field-based biomarker collection, and socioeconomic health disparities. The data resulting from this project will increase our understanding of the pathways through which the psychosocial family environment influences CVD risk and whether a psychosocial intervention can reduce CVD risk. By examining the moderating role of lifetime adversity and SES, the study will further inform future intervention research to unlock the potential of such interventions to reduce SES-based CVD disparities."
"9468427","Project Abstract/Summary Dysregulation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) dopaminergic signaling is associated with multiple neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Current antipsychotics have high affinity for Gi/o-coupled D2 and D3 receptors (D2R, D3R). While there has been considerable focus on the role of prefrontal D2Rs in neuropsychiatric disease, there is emerging evidence that the D3R is also critically important. However, we know very little about the cellular distribution and function of D3Rs in prefrontal circuits, or how antipsychotics regulate their function. The goal of this proposal is to determine the neuronal distribution and function of D3R in prefrontal cortex, the cellular mechanisms by which D3R regulates neuronal excitability, and the mechanisms by which antipsychotics regulate their function. We will use a combination of electrophysiology, 2-photon imaging, and molecular biology in native and heterologous systems to examine D3R signaling mechanisms, with particular focus on the potential role of arrestin-mediated signaling. Results of this study will provide insight into how PFC networks function normally and abnormally in psychiatric disease.  "
"9428407","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Unfortunately, there are still no effective treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse AD. As new clinical trials focus on the initial stages of disease, early diagnosis is now more important than ever.  Human neuroimaging has greatly improved our knowledge of this disease by demonstrating selectively vulnerable large-scale networks whose connectivity declines in AD. Transgenic mouse models of AD have identified specific brain regions whose aberrant excitatory activity causes neuronal network dysfunction. However, the exact relationship between neural network abnormalities in animal models with that in the human condition remains unknown. To better understand the altered neural dynamics underlying clinical symptoms in AD will require novel techniques and methodologies.  Speech and language abnormalities are evident in AD patients from the very early stages of the disease. We propose to use a novel magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) approach to determine the speech- motor-network deficits of AD-spectrum patients. MEGI provides direct recordings of brain activity with precise millisecond resolution. The goal of this study is to understand the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of speech encoding and speech execution in AD patients. Using customized software we will measure brain activity patterns across high and low frequency bands. We expect to find unique signatures of speech-motor- network dysconnectivity in AD. Such knowledge will be related to underlying synaptic dysfunctions of vulnerable neuronal populations as early biomarkers of the disease and will have important implications for translational research.  The candidate is a physician-scientist with a strong commitment to a career in neurodegenerative dementia research. The candidate has an MD and a PhD in cognition and neuroscience. The research proposal and career development plan build upon her training in rodent neurophysiology and auditory and speech processing to provide expertise in human brain connectivity and its relationship to cognitive deficits in AD. Dr. Keith Vossel, a physician-scientist who cares for patients with dementia and specializes in transgenic mouse models of neurodegenerative disease, is the candidate's sponsor. The mentoring and research experience described in this proposal will facilitate the candidate's goal of developing a strong independent research career."
"9470796","Abstract The lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (LP), which is the mouse analog of the primate pulvinar, is a higher-order visual thalamic nucleus that is thought to play an important role in visual attention. A key difference between LP/pulvinar and the first-order visual thalamic nucleus LGN is that LP/pulvinar receives two distinct cortical inputs: one from layer 6 that it shares with LGN, and one from layer 5 that avoids LGN. Prior studies of the morphological and physiological characteristics of these inputs have suggested that the two corticothalamic (CT) populations may have very different effects on activity in LP/pulvinar. In particular, it has been hypothesized that the layer 5 CT group, which has large synaptic terminals in LP/pulvinar that resemble retinal ganglion cell terminals in LGN, provide the primary ?driving? input to LP/pulvinar and shape its visual response properties. Meanwhile, the layer 6 CT population, which has more numerous but smaller terminals in LP/pulvinar, may contribute ?modulatory? input. While this ?driver/modulator? framework has been very influential in generating hypotheses about LP/pulvinar's interactions with cortex, whether layer 5 and layer 6 CT cells are functional drivers and modulators, respectively, of LP/pulvinar has never been directly tested. This is due to the lack of tools for selectively targeting each of these CT populations in primates, in which the pulvinar has been much more extensively studied than LP in rodents. However, transgenic and viral tools enabling cell-type specificity as well as a recently improved understanding of the mouse visual system now make this a tractable question in mice. To test this longstanding hypothesis, the layer 5 CT population will be selectively targeted for optogenetic manipulations by injecting a retrograde viral vector carrying Cre recombinase to superior colliculus (which is another projection target of layer 5 CT neurons in addition to LP), and layer 6 CT neurons will be specifically targeted with the Ntsr1-Cre transgenic mouse line. Multi-shank neural probes with high-density microelectrode arrays will be used to record extracellular single-unit activity in LP of awake mice while optogenetically manipulating CT neurons. This will make it possible to measure each CT subpopulation's effect on visual and spontaneous activity in LP and determine if they are functional ?drivers? or ?modulators?. Layer 5 and layer 6 CT neurons originating from primary versus higher visual cortex will also be separately targeted in order to more precisely evaluate how different visual cortical areas communicate with LP. This will also address the question of whether either of the CT subpopulations relay the visual preferences of their source cortical area to LP as would be hypothesized of a functional ?driver? but not a ?modulator?. Together, the proposed set of experiments will have significant implications for understanding LP/pulvinar's role in visual processing through its interactions with visual cortex."
"9523990","The overall 5-year survival rate of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is less than 50%, and ~75% of human HNSCC cases have mutations in the tumor suppressor p53. The vast majority of p53 mutations are missense mutations that show oncogenic activities, with strong correlation with poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC. Recent evidence indicates that stabilization of mutant p53 (mutp53) in tumors is crucial for its oncogenic activities, while its knockdown attenuates tumor progression. Although there are numerous publications on the function and regulation of wild-type p53 (wtp53), little is known about mechanisms controlling mutp53 levels in tumors and the workable strategies that induce mutp53 degradation. The goal of this proposal is to discover efficient strategies to specifically degrade mutp53 in HNSCC and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. To identify compounds that reduce mutp53 levels, we performed high throughput screening of chemical libraries and identified ?statins?, a class of drugs that inhibit cholesterol production, as degradation inducers of structurally misfolded mutp53 proteins. Statins showed minimal effects on wtp53 and DNA contact mutp53 with native structure. Reduction in mevalonte-5-phosphate (MVP), but not other metabolites in the mevalonate (MV) pathway, triggered mutp53 degradation by CHIP ubiquitin ligase in a protein prenylation-independent manner. Statins also inhibited binding of mutp53 to DNAJA1, a molecular chaperone of the Hsp40 family which plays a role in refolding of misfolded proteins. Indeed, mutp53 degradation by statins was nullified by MVP supplementation, as well as by DNAJA1 overexpression. These data suggest that MVP positively regulates the DNAJA1-mutp53 binding and that DNAJA1 stabilizes misfolded mutp53. However, it is still unclear how reduced MVP leads to inhibition of DNAJA1-mutp53 binding. Based on our compelling preliminary data showing that reduction in MVP by knockdown of mevalonate kinase (MVK) increased acetylation of mutp53, we hypothesize that acetylation of mutp53 upon MVP reduction inhibits the mutp53-DNAJA1 binding, which promotes mutp53 degradation, leading to tumor suppression. We will test this hypothesis and establish the role of DNAJA1 in the malignant progression of HNSCC cells. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism by which reduced MVP leads to inhibited binding of mutp53 with DNAJA1 to induce mutp53 degradation and tumor suppression. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that DNAJA1 promotes HNSCC progression in a misfolded mutp53-dependent manner. In Aim 3, we will characterize potential DNAJA1 inhibitors identified through molecular docking studies for their abilities to bind to DNAJA1, induce mutp53 degradation, and reduce the malignant properties of HNSCC cells. Completion of this study will reveal a novel mechanism of mutp53 stabilization via unexpected functional link between MVP and DNAJA1 and will establish the MV pathway and DNAJA1 as novel therapeutic targets for mutp53-carrying cancers. This study may also identify a DNAJA1 inhibitor as a potential compound that can be used for HNSCC therapy."
"9457416","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): UC Berkeley's Department of Bioengineering (BioE) is educating the next cadre of biomedical leaders and innovators. Our program consists of a Clinical Immersion (summer internship), Engineering Immersion (Fall Semester Capstone), and Translational Immersion (Spring Semester) periods. The renewal R25 builds on established partnerships with >20 departments at UCSF Medical Centers, Stanford Medical, and the UC Davis Medical Centers in addition to the newly established UCSF Rosenman Institute and the new UC Berkeley Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation. Unique aspects include: first, unmet needs formulated from 8-week in-clinic needs finding during the Clinical Immersion by BioE Fellows (Capstone alumni) and Protégés (rising Capstone seniors). Second, direct teaming of BioE undergraduates with clinical clients during the Engineering Immersion. Third, we partner the aforementioned two new institutes, one focused on engineering design (Jacobs) and one focused on biomedical device translation (Rosenman) . Fourth, we will enhance all three Immersion periods by integrating two factors (self-efficacy and community support) that are correlated with subsequent pursuit of STEM careers; the latter factor being acutely relevant to URM career decisions. We will retain the Clinical-Engineering-Translational Immersion framework and pursue two new Aims: (1) Inculcate engineering design approaches with an emphasis on self-efficacy (Engineering Immersion) and (2) Expand community engagement and support (Engineering & Translational Immersion). In Aim 1, we will transform our Capstone course into a fully studio-based course housed in the new Jacobs Hall. Lecture content will be recorded and viewed a priori. Studios will be hands-on workshops, case study discussion, and in-depth Design Reviews. Real-time self-assessment will be developed and integrated into each studio so that students receive tangible (irrefutable) evidence of mastery to enhance self-efficacy. In Aim 2, we will enhance both the Engineering and Translational Immersion periods. We will add Engineering Advisors to each Capstone project, but not supplant the Clinical Client. Engineering Advisors are accomplished senior engineers and fellows of the UCSF Rosenman Institute. In addition to technical feedback, Advisors will provide societal capital needed for our students (and URM students in particular) to join established formal and informal entrepreneurial networks. Also supporting Aim 2, we will provide financial support not just for project resources but also for student presentation of project outcomes at state and national meetings, as is crit ical for establishing self-efficacy and engaging with a supportive technical community (again, an acute factor in URM selection of BioE as a career path). The Immersion program combines didactic and experiential training to provide a comprehensive introduction to translational medicine innovation -- with the aim of supplementing theoretical knowledge with hands-on engineering for clinical and biomedical environments. 1"
"9455670","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glucose homeostasis and regulation of food intake are both promoted by the secretion of gut hormones following nutrient stimulation of enteroendocrine cells (L-cells) in the lower gut. This process is impaired in diabetes but is restored when delivery of dietary compounds such as amino acids and fatty acids to the lower gut is facilitated. This effect of delivery of nutrients to the lower gut is observed after gastric bypass surgery and during fermentation of carbohydrates in the colon, both of which can result in resolution of diabetes. These approaches to deliver nutrients to the lower gut are not without complications, although their resulting efficacy is often superior to existing drugs. Currently marketed anti-diabetes drugs have deficiencies in efficacy, durability of effect, and safety, and the pharmaceutical industry has, therefore, been looking for novel approaches to restore impaired gut-hormone secretion. BioKier has identified a simple, direct, safe method to deliver one of the key nutrients to the colon in a way that can be developed for the treatment of diabetes and other conditions characterized by impaired L-cell stimulation. BioKier's concept involves the approach of delivering nutrients as gut hormone secretagogues to the colon via a colon-targeting formulation for the treatment of diabetes and other disorders. Acute studies conducted by BioKier showed that direct delivery via catheter of specific nutrients to the colon of diabetic animals and humans restored the oral glucose-induced gut hormone response. Chronic treatment with an oral formulation of a representative nutrient completely prevented the development of diabetes in a diabetes-prone rat model and supported the concept that the approach could lead to development of a marketable therapeutic. Based on lead-selection data from the acute clinical studies, L-glutamine was formulated in an oral, sustained-release, colon-targeted capsule for testing in type 2 diabetes patients. In order to conduct human testing, the glutamine formulation needs to be tested in animals for safety; as is proposed in Phase I of the SBIR application in a local toxicity and toxicokinetic study of BKR 013 capsules in dogs. Phase II involves conduct of a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, plasma GLP-1 and insulin biomarker responses, and safety of BKR-013 in diabetes drug-naïve type 2 diabetes patients. Endpoints are to assess the bioavailability of L-glutamine and measure biomarkers to confirm colon- specific delivery. Progress thus far has attracted the interest of several potential pharmaceutical partners who have indicated the results of the clinical study to be funded by this application are crucial to discussions of a licensing agreement."
"9494335","Project Summary/Abstract A group of NIH supported investigators requests funds to purchase an 800 MHz NMR console, CryoProbe, and magnet cooling control system (BMPC). This equipment will be used to significantly upgrade an existing shared 800 MHz NMR spectrometer that is housed in the UCLA-DOE NMR Core Facility. The existing 13 year old Bruker 800 MHz NMR spectrometer is heavily used by a number of research groups at UCLA, but is unreliable and outdated. Specifically, we request funds to purchase a Bruker Avance Neo console and BMPC II system that will be used to replace an Avance I console and a BMPC I system that were installed in 2004. Funds are also requested to purchase a Triple Resonance CryoProbe which will replace an older model TCI CryoProbe which was also installed in 2004. Installation of a new console, BMPC, and CryoProbe will dramatically increase the utility of the 800 MHz NMR spectrometer. The refurbished instrument will have improved sensitivity, functionality, and reliability. The refurbished instrument will have up to 2-fold higher sensitivity due to the newer CryoProbe and improved console electronics. The spectrometer will also have greatly expanded capability due to the newer hardware and software, allowing it to perform newer experiments that are not possible using the older instrument. It will also be possible to operate the spectrometer using the latest software, which will provide many advantages. The CryoProbe will have expanded capabilities as it will have a cold 15N preamplifier and will be tunable to 19F, which is an extremely useful probe for biological applications. The new instrumentation is expected to be significantly more reliable than the existing NMR spectrometer. The console of the existing instrument suffers from frequent malfunctions, most of which are intermittent and difficult to pinpoint and diagnose. The BMPC, which cools the magnet to 2 Kelvin via a pumping system and which is critical to keeping the magnet at field, is at risk because replacement parts are becoming difficult to obtain. The current CryoProbe is well past the age where the manufacturer guarantees support. The new equipment will be managed by an experienced Ph.D.- level staff scientist, who has successfully maintained and operated the NMR instrumentation at the facility for the past 19 years."
"9452124","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this application is to advance primary prevention of stroke in patients at risk for stroke due to atherosclerosis of the carotid artery.  Four to eight percent of adults have asymptomatic carotid stenosis exceeding 50%. Carotid stenosis is often managed either by endarterectomy or stenting. About 100,000 carotid endarterectomies and 40,000 carotid stenting procedures are done each year in the US. Up to 90% of these procedures are done on asymptomatic patients. Medical therapy has improved. The ACST trial demonstrated that medical management of hyperlipidemia can attenuate the benefits of revascularization in patients with asymptomatic stenosis. Further advances in managing atherosclerotic risk factors may negate benefit that might otherwise be realized through revascularization, making the morbidity of the procedures unjustifiable. Endarterectomy and stenting have also improved. The results for endarterectomy in CREST showed a periprocedural stroke and death rate of 1.4%. For stenting, the rate was the lowest yet reported in a randomized controlled trial, 2.5%, and that rate was improving in the last tertil of enrollment.  We will conduct two parallel randomized, multicenter non-inferiority trials (CREST-2). The primary specific aims will be to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to carotid endarterectomy (n=1050) and also to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to stenting (n=1050) for patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The primary endpoint will be a composite of any stroke or death within 30 days of randomization plus ipsilateral stroke up to 4 years of follow-up. Vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and hyperlipidemia, will be managed centrally using modern aggressive targets. Should intensive medical management be declared non-inferior to endarterectomy, stenting or both, up to 5,000 periprocedural strokes may be prevented."
"9456814","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury represents a considerable public health problem which exerts both a large financial burden on society, and post-traumatic reductions in quality of life through a constellation of cognitive impairments on individuals. The identification of pharmacological approaches to reduce brain injury-induced neuroinflammation currently exists as an unmet need despite advances in diagnostic techniques. Secondary mechanisms of neurodegeneration such as neuroinflammation are thought to contribute to post-traumatic cognitive impairments. Prostaglandins (PGs) and other eicosanoids have been found to play an important role in neuroinflammation, the production of which occurs via the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) by biosynthetic enzymes. Recent discoveries yield new insight into a novel pathway which supports the production of AA from within the endocannabinoid system. In vitro work shows that inhibiting diacylglycerol lipase-? (DAGL-?) reduces the biosynthesis of 2-arachadonoyl glycerol, an endogenous cannabinoid ligand but also a precursor for the production of AA. This reduction in the production of free AA in turn results in decreases in PG formation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Therefore, we hypothesize that inhibiting DAGL-? will provide cognitive protection following brain injury in a murine learning and memory assay by reducing the pool of available AA that contributes to the production of PGE2 and other pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines in the hippocampus. Accordingly, the objectives of this training plan are to determine the distinct contribution of DAGL-? blockade on the reversal of TBI-induced memory impairments in mice, as well as the dampening of downstream production of prostanoids, and pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by microglial cells in the hippocampus. The proposed aims to examine these objectives are: 1) Evaluate the consequences of DAGL-ß inhibition on TBI-induced cognitive impairments in mice, 2) Evaluate the impact of DAGL-? inhibition on TBI-induced production of eCBs, AA, and PGs, and 3) Evaluate the impact of DAGL-? inhibition on TBI-induced production of a pro-inflammatory cytokine on CNS cell types. The completion of the research outlined in this training plan will contribute to the understanding of the role that DAGL-? plays in injury-induced production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids separate from its action at cannabinoid receptors, as well as provide Ms. O'Brien with the necessary technical skills and theoretical foundation toward becoming an independent investigator."

"9443669","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a developmental intellectual disability caused by the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) function. Altered synaptic plasticity and downstream protein synthesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of FXS, contributing to typical FXS phenotypes. Although the loss of FMRP in neurons abolishes its repressive function on protein synthesis, how synaptic activation and plasticity (especially in cortex) is altered in FXS remains largely unclear. Interestingly, previou in vivo experiments to selectively delete neuronal FMRP showed partial FXS-related phenotypes. This implies that the selective loss of neuronal FMRP may not be sufficient to induce full FXS pathology and therefore that the loss of FMRP in other brain cells may also contribute to pathogenesis of FXS. Previous studies have found FMRP is expressed in astroglial cells. However, pathogenic roles of the in vivo loss of the astroglial FMRP in FXS remain essentially unexplored. We found significantly reduced glutamate transporter GLT1 and EAAT2 (human analog of rodent GLT1) expression in the cortex of the mouse model (fmr1 knock-out, KO mice) of FXS and human FXS post-mortem samples, and decreased glutamate uptake in fmr1 KO mice. We recently generated inducible astroglia-specific fmr1 conditional knock-out (i-astro-fmr1-cKO) and restoration (i-astro-fmr1-cON) mouse models in which the fmr1 allele is selectively disrupted or restored in astroglia, respectively. We showed that selective deletion of the astroglial FMRP plays a primary role in GLT1 reduction in FXS in vitro and in vivo. Selective deletion of the astroglial FMRP also leads to decreased synaptic AMPA/NMDA current ratio and FXS-like behavior phenotypes (hyperactivity and exaggerated memory extinction). Based on previous observations and our preliminary results, we propose to investigate astroglial dysfunctions in FXS. Specifically, we will 1) Test if the loss of astroglial FMRP contributes to th pathogenesis of FXS in vivo; 2) Investigate mechanisms for GLT1 dysregulation in FXS mouse models; 3) Test if GLT1 up-regulation attenuates FXS phenotypes in FXS mouse models We have generated a large amount of preliminary data to support our rationales and to demonstrate feasibility for proposed aims. Results from this project will determine if the selective loss of astroglial FMRP contributes to the FXS pathogenesis by potentially reducing GLT1 expression and impairing extracellular glutamate uptake. These results may demonstrate a conceptually novel astroglia-mediated pathogenic pathway in FXS. In addition, the effects of GLT1 up-regulation on FXS-related phenotypes in mouse models of FXS will potentially validate astroglial GLT1 as a new therapeutic target for treating FXS."
"9450654","Research: Prenatal genetic services have expanded at an extraordinary pace over the past 4 years with the development of fetal genome sequencing using cell-free placental DNA in maternal serum. Some commentators predict that this new technology, which allows for noninvasive determination of an increasingly wide range of maternal-fetal health conditions, will improve prenatal care, especially in lower-resource areas. However, this is called into question by research on lower uptake of existing prenatal screening and diagnostic services among ethnic minority populations, even when structural barriers to access are removed. These disparities have lead to differential outcomes among some populations, including higher rates of live births affected by a genetic condition and higher maternal-infant morbidity and mortality. We will conduct community based participatory qualitative research with women of African American and Latina ethnicity to assess their understanding of and desire to accept prenatal genetic services. Through our community partners, we will feed the results of our research back into the communities in question in order to facilitate fruitful discussions of future interventions to increase access in ethnic minority populations.  Candidate: I hold a PhD in Science and Technology Studies and have trained in clinical and research ethics with two NHGRI ELSI CEERS, at Stanford and Duke Universities. My goal is to become an independently- funded researcher focusing on community based participatory research at the intersection of women's health, health disparities and genetics. To that end, my goals for this training period are as follows:  1. Improve skills in ascertaining and communicating genetics and genetic risk in the prenatal period.  2. Improve skills in community engagement and health disparities research  3. Build community partnerships that allow for long-term development and implementation of interventions  to improve access to prenatal genetic care. The K award would allow me to seek answers to important questions around barriers to access to prenatal genetic care among underserved communities. It would allow me to pursue training in community engagement, genetics, and health disparities and to forge links with researchers in the field for collaborative dissemination in order to build a robust research portfolio around reducing health disparities among pregnant women from underserved populations.  Mentorship and Institutional environment: I have assembled a strong internal and external mentorship and advisory team of experts in the fields of Bioethics and Obstetric Care to guide me and support my research and training. The research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, a premier research institution with access to extensive genetic, health services, and translational research resources that will enhance my efforts to achieve my ambitious aims."
"9524467","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  As a strategy to gain insight into the mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression, we have studied the proliferative response to injury and its relationship to malignant growth, with the urinary bladder as a major focus. Bladder cancer is the fourth most prevalent cancer in men, twelfth in women, and invasive bladder cancer is uniformly lethal left untreated. Local surgical excision is often followed by recurrence: this and the high risk of progression together require constant monitoring, a major contributor to the cost of bladder cancer treatment, which is the highest per patient for any cancer.  Our recent work has shown that basal Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-expressing cells of the bladder epithelium (urothelium) function as stem cells that support the repopulation and renewal of all urothelial cell types in response to bladder injury such as that caused by urinary tract infection (UTI). This injury response is triggered by increased Shh protein production from basal stem cells of bladder epithelium, which in turn triggers production of Wnt and Bmp proteins in subjacent cells of the stroma; these stromal niche signals in turn drive proliferation and differentiation of urothelial stem cells and their progeny. We also showed that Shh- expressing basal stem cells are the cell-of-origin for the most lethal form of bladder cancer, invasive urothelial carcinoma (IUC), and for its epithelially-confined precursor lesion, carcinoma in situ (CIS).  During the previous award period we made the surprising discovery that the CIS lesion, although epithelially-confined, can spread throughout the entire urothelium by clonal expansion of a single basal stem cell, indicating the aggressively proliferative nature of CIS cells. We also found that Shh-induced stromal signals that promote terminal urothelial differentiation constitute the major barrier to progression from epithelially-confined to invasive disease (CIS to IUC). In the current proposal, we aim to: (i) characterize the tissue dynamics and regulatory basis of transient vs. persistent proliferative states in injury response as compared to carcinoma in situ; (ii) identify the regulatory signals that control terminal differentiation of bladder epithelial cells; and (iii) characterize the genetic and epigenetic changes underlying the loss of differentiation- inducing signals during progression from non-invasive to invasive disease (CIS to IUC).  This work will provide the basis for improved diagnosis of CIS and may provide targets for suppression of the persistently proliferative state of CIS cells. In addition, this work may provide the basis for blocking progression to invasive disease by administration of pro-differentiation signals, potentially including FDA- approved drugs such as FK506 and retinoic acid, or by blocking or reversing the changes that underlie the loss of differentiation signal production. This work may extend beyond bladder cancer to other endodermal malignancies, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma, in which Shh-induced stromal signals also restrain cancer growth."
"9616478","Rapid and Simple Paper Strip Test for the Multiplexed Detection of Gastrointestinal Pathogens at the Point-of-Need GoDx Product Summary: This Phase 1 project will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a paper strip device for rapid (<30 minutes) and simple multiplexed detection of a 7 gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens that cause diarrheal disease. The pathogens include C. Difficile (for the U.S.) and the 6 pathogens (Cryptosporidium, Giardia lamblia, Rotavirus, Shigella, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), and Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC)) commonly found in the developing world.

"9475022","SUMMARY (AIM 2): SYSTEMS PHARMACOLOGY CORE The Systems Pharmacology Core will provide all investigators and trainees who are part of this proposal, as well as individuals selected for funded internal research projects, access to an integrated resource for deep molecular profiling of cells and tissues and for analyzing the resulting data using a diversity of computational tools. The core draws on the resources of the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP), which co-localizes postdocs and students from multiple research groups with professional PhD-level research staff who lead technology platforms. This will result in close and regular interaction between research projects and diverse measurement technologies both as a means to ensure continuous improvement in omic technologies as well as to assist investigators and trainees with experimental design and interpretation. Staff involved in the Systems Pharmacology Core also have a role in education and training as described under education and outreach in Aim 3. The LSP embraces a philosophy of continuous process improvement. For example, in the last year we implemented, and published in high impact journals, new approaches to single cell sequencing, focused proteomics and highly multiplexed single-cell imaging. To promote innovation, staff scientists charged with individual technologies will attend conferences and workshops on the latest technologies and continue to publish their work as primary and contributing authors. Aim 2.1 will support next generation sequencing and RNA-Seq using three complementary technologies that differ in cost, degree of coverage, throughput of samples and use of bulk vs. single cells. Aim 2.2 will provide mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics using isobaric tags optimized in the MS3 mode as well as focused proteomics using the recently developed TOMAHAQ method (in lieu of multiple reaction monitoring), and phospho-mass spectrometry using the latest generation Orbitrap Fusion? Lumos? Tribrid? Mass Spectrometer. Absolute quantification of peptides will aid in data interpretation and data fusion. Aim 2.3 will enable highly multiplexed (20-40 channel) imaging of cultured cells before and after exposure to drugs using an innovative Cyclic Immunofluorescence (CycIF) method developed at the LSP. Aim 2.4 will support metabolomic profiling of cell and serum samples using a targeted method that measures the levels of ~300 metabolites of known identity based on a library of reference compounds. Aim 2.5 will perform multiplex immunoassays on cytokines and growth factors as well as high dimensional flow cytometry and CyTOF mass cytometry to deeply profile human blood. Aim 2.6 will provide access to training and core technologies for general purpose data analysis (clustering, regression, dimensionality reduction) as a complement to specific modeling efforts in individual research projects."
"9467557","Evolutionary innovations and adaptations often require rapid and concerted changes in regulation of gene expression at many loci. Transposable elements (TEs) constitute the most dynamic part of eukaryotic genomes, and insertions of transposable elements can influence the expression of surrounding genes by donating new regulatory elements. A longstanding hypothesis, first proposed by Barbara McClintock, postulates that the dispersal of transposable elements may allow for the same regulatory motif to be recruited at many genomic locations, thereby drawing multiple genes into the same regulatory network. Empirical evidence for this model is however scarce, and most putative examples of TE-mediated rewiring of regulatory networks rely on a statistical association between remnants of a TE at a subset of genes or genomic regions. We recently provided the first direct functional evidence of an active TE rewiring a regulatory network by showing that the acquisition of novel binding sites for the dosage compensation complex at young neo-sex chromosomes in Drosophila was driven by dispersal of a domesticated TE. Here we propose to quantify the involvement of TEs vs. acquisition of regulatory sites by other mutations in rewiring regulatory networks, by systematically studying the evolution of dosage compensation binding sites at over a dozen independently formed young neo-sex chromosomes in Drosophila. Our detailed understanding of how dosage compensation in Drosophila works at the molecular level makes it an ideal model system to study the rewiring of regulatory networks, and recent methodological development make the investigation of binding site evolution at newly formed X chromosomes in non-model Drosophila species feasible, making this a timely and exciting proposal."
"9463120","Abstract  Malaria remains a major public health issue. Infection with Plasmodium falciparum species parasites is most lethal. Increasing resistance to current antimalarial treatments makes new drug development imperative. Plasmodium parasites are obligate intracellular purine auxotrophs. Purine salvage pathways are therefore good targets for antimalarial drug development. An equilibrative nucleoside transporter, PfENT1, is the primary pathway for purine uptake by P. falciparum. However, there has been evidence of a secondary pathway that can import AMP as a purine source. This pathway remains to be characterized. In Aim #1 I will characterize the AMP purine transport into P. falciparum through radiolabel substrate uptake inhibition experiments with purines and potential inhibitors. I will test whether AMP transport is mediated through a sodium-coupled or proton- coupled process. Results from these experiments will provide novel insight into P. falciparum biology. Previous work in the lab using a high throughput screen identified PfENT1 inhibitors. The hits block the transporter and kill malaria parasites in culture. However, these initial hits are not potent enough to be drugs. In Aim #2, I will participate in the hit-to-lead medicinal chemistry process to optimize these PfENT1 inhibitor hits and determine the structure-activity relationships for these compounds. I will evaluate their potency in parasite cytotoxicity assays and their human cell toxicity using human hepatoma HepG2 cytotoxicity assays. This process will allow us to determine what chemical characteristics provide drug hits with the potential to be converted into drug candidates. In Aim #3, I will determine whether naturally occurring non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified in genome sequencing of P. falciparum field isolates affect efficacy of the PfENT1 inhibitors that we are developing as potential antimalarial drugs. It is possible that the efficacy of PfENT1 inhibitors can be affected by the presence of SNPs in PfENT1. We have identified 13 non- synonymous SNPs in the more than 100 sequences in the PlasmoDB database. I will express PfENT1-SNPs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using a PfENT1-pCM189 yeast expression vector. I will determine whether the SNPs affect purine import and PfENT1 inhibitor efficacy. Available PfENT1-SNP expressing parasite isolates will also be tested using parasite cytotoxicity assays with inhibitors. These experiments will help us determine if PfENT1 SNPs could cause resistance to our inhibitors. These experiments will advance the drug development process for the PfENT1 inhibitors and hopefully lead to the development of successful antimalarial drugs. Participation in this project will provide me with the opportunity to learn about membrane transport physiology, parasite biology and the early stage drug development process. It will provide me with an excellent foundation for a career in biomedical research."
"9412873","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases caused by insufficient or abnormal blood vessel growth affect a wide range of tissues, and include heart and brain ischemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, and osteoporosis. At the heart of angiogenesis lies the inflammatory response, orchestrated primarily by macrophages. Changes in the behavior of macrophages have major effects on angiogenesis and vascularization of tissue engineering scaffolds that are designed to replace damaged tissues. The proposed work has two major goals: 1) to define the relationship between macrophages and angiogenesis, and 2) to develop a novel biomaterial platform to control macrophage behavior in order to encourage vascularization by the body's own cells. In normal wound healing, macrophages first exhibit a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, and then switch to an alternatively activated M2 phenotype. Although angiogenesis is a part of normal wound healing, the relative contributions of M1 and M2 macrophages to angiogenesis are not well understood. M2 macrophages can also be subdivided into two different phenotypes, M2a and M2c, each with distinct but poorly understood effects on angiogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that M1 and M2 (both M2a and M2c) macrophages function synergistically and sequentially to promote the growth of new blood vessels. Co-culture experiments between polarized macrophages and endothelial cells will be used to investigate how their crosstalk affects both the M1-to-M2 transition of macrophages and the phenotypic changes in endothelial cells that lead to sprouting and stabilization of new blood vessels. A 3D model of angiogenesis that tracks the behavior of endothelial cells and pericytes over 5 days will be used to probe the effects of changing the timing, duration, and sequence of signals secreted by the different macrophage phenotypes. Finally, macrophage regulation of angiogenesis will be evaluated in vivo using novel immunomodulatory drug delivery systems designed to recapitulate the normal sequence of M1 and M2 macrophage activation. This project will investigate the mechanisms of macrophage regulation of successful blood vessel growth, which will enhance our understanding of how it goes awry in pathological conditions. In addition, this project will result in a novel and biomimetc approach to direct scaffold vascularization by controlling the actions of host macrophages."
"9424669","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coloboma is a congenital segmental ocular defect which can affect various structures of the eye. Coloboma is often associated with microphthalmia, microcornea, and/or retinal detachment and leads to visual impairment. We and another group recently reported a novel factor associated with coloboma, MAB21L2. As part of these studies, we generated a zebrafish mab21l2 allelic series carrying frameshift, in-frame indel and missense mutations in the orthologous gene region and observed coloboma and severe ocular disorganization in these mutants. Next, screening of another MAB21L gene, MAB21L1, in human patients identified likely pathogenic alleles indicating an independent role in human ocular disease. We followed up this finding with the development of additional zebrafish lines carrying frameshift alleles in the mab21l1 gene and identified coloboma and anterior segment defects in these mutants. These studies revealed essential and conserved roles for MAB21L1/mab21l1 and MAB21L2/mab21l2 in ocular development. The MAB21L factors encode proteins similar to C. elegans mab-21 cell fate-determining factor; however, the function of these proteins is largely unknown. In this project, we will reveal MAB21L function in ocular development. Our primary hypothesis is that MAB21L factors represent regulatory proteins that, through interaction with PAX6 and the BMP signaling pathway, direct normal eye patterning. This will be investigated through the following aims: 1) to uncover the cellular and molecular processes controlled by MAB21L/mab21l factors during eye development and 2) to reveal the function of MAB21L/mab21l proteins during eye development. The first aim will explore mab21l2 and mab21l1 mutants to identify disrupted cellular processes using various methods including time-lapse 4D microscopy in collaboration with Dr. Kwan. To gain an insight into the mechanisms by which mab21l factors direct ocular development, transcriptome and proteome analyses of mutants will be performed to identify transcripts/proteins with significant deviation from normal patterns. The identified factors will be further evaluated by rescue experiments in zebrafish mutants as well as sequencing of orthologous genes in human patients. The second aim will focus on functional examination of MAB21L proteins using SELEX and ChIP sequencing in a mab21l2-FLAG knock-in line. The obtained data will be analyzed together with transcriptome/proteome data to reveal the hierarchy of molecular changes and define the underlying mechanisms. The interaction between mab21l and pax6 factors, as well as mab21l and the bmp4 pathway, will be examined using corresponding mutant and reporter lines. The outlined experiments will reveal novel mechanisms of vertebrate ocular development and human disease."
"9447226","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pulmonary alveolar homeostasis is dependent upon balanced airway and tissue surfactant pools. Quantitative and qualitative alterations in alveolar surfactant pools are associated with inflammation and tissue destruction in severe lung diseases including infant respiratory distress syndrome, many forms of acute lung injury and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Identification of a physiologically-dominant molecular pathway within alveolar epithelial cells that senses and regulates endogenous alveolar surfactant pools, coupled with the ability to pharmacologically modulate it both positively and negatively, would be a major therapeutic advance for patients with lung diseases associated with pulmonary surfactant disorders. Preliminary data supporting this application strongly implicate an alveolar epithelial cell-centric, G protein-dependent pathway driven by GPR116 as a druggable molecular target to modulate endogenous alveolar surfactant pools. We demonstrate that GPR116 is abundantly expressed in human and mouse lung, and pulmonary epithelium-specific deletion of GPR116 in mice results in early and progressive accumulation of alveolar surfactant associated with phospholipid peroxidation, neutrophilia and alveolar remodeling, culminating in respiratory failure. We have identified a novel synthetic peptide that is sufficient to activate G protein-dependent signaling downstream of mouse and human GPR116 in vitro and suppress alveolar surfactant levels in mice in vivo, providing proof-of- concept that GPR116 is a plausible therapeutic target to modulate endogenous alveolar surfactant pools in humans. Our central hypothesis is that epithelial GPR116 regulates alveolar surfactant homeostasis via Gq/11- driven modulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in alveolar type II cells. Our goal in this projec is to systematically define the signaling pathways by which GPR116 controls surfactant homeostasis using cell-based assays and mouse genetics through completion of three integrated aims. In the first aim, we will test the hypothesis that GPR116-dependent activation of a Gq/G11-PKC?-dependent pathway induces cortical F-actin assembly to suppress surfactant secretion and/or decrease surfactant uptake in alveolar type II cells. In the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that activation of epithelial GPR116 is sufficient to restore surfactant homeostasis in two established mouse models of alveolar surfactant overload, Csf2rb-/- and Sftpd-/- mice. In the third aim, we will test the hypothesis that increased alveolar surfactant pools initiate alveolar macrophage oxidative stress and subsequent alveolar simplification in Gpr116-/- mice. Successful completion of these specific aims will delineate the signaling pathways by which GPR116 senses and regulates surfactant and alveolar homeostasis. The long-term goal of this work is to identify potential therapeutic targets, including GPR116 itself, that will permit modulation of endogenous surfactant levels to treat human lung diseases associated with surfactant dysfunction."
"9453934","Project Summary Chronic sleep disturbance affects 10-20% of the population in the developed world, representing a substantial public health problem. Given the ubiquitous nature of sleep across the animal kingdom, intense investigation is underway into the biological functions of sleep. A primary hypothesis is that sleep facilitates memory consolidation following learning, as sleep restriction or fragmentation impairs memory performance across species. The circuitry coupling sleep and memory remains undefined. Recently, ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons have been demonstrated to control motivational gating of arousal. These cells are well known players in ?reward and salience? circuitry, and send projections to brain centers critical for memory formation and recall (i.e., hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex). How these (or local VTA-GABAergic) neurons contribute to sleep-dependent memory consolidation is unknown. Wake-stabilizing hypocretin (Hcrt) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus send dense projections to the VTA, however, it is unknown how (or if) this circuit contributes to Hcrt-mediated arousal or memory function. This proposal will integrate in vivo optogenetics, calcium imaging, and EEG techniques along with behavioral assays to establish (or refute) a role for these cells in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. fMRI technology will be integrated with optogenetic manipulations and quantitative approaches (dynamic causal modeling) to delineate brain-wide responses to Hcrt stimulation. These findings will establish the Hcrt-to-VTA circuit as a node coupling vigilance states to memory consolidation, with the ultimate goal of providing comprehensive insight into disorders of sleep-wake dynamics and memory dysfunction."

"9453251","Project Summary/Abstract Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis, collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are devastating diseases that affect over one million people in the US. Current IBD therapies target the immune system, leaving patients susceptible to opportunistic infections. Therefore, the discovery of new therapeutics for IBD is an important priority. Recent studies have discovered several metabolites produced exclusively by gut bacteria that exert immunomodulatory effects at the mucosal interface. Indolepropionic acid (IPA) has emerged as the most exciting compound thus far in that it specifically engages host receptors and protects from experimental colitis in mice. This compound is produced by a discrete number of strictly anaerobic gut commensal bacteria including Clostridium sporogenes. Strategies to modulate levels of IPA could represent a new adjunct therapy for IBD patients. Despite the broad interest in this compound, the specific biochemical pathways involved in its synthesis are entirely unknown. Our long-term objective is to develop new therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling the metabolic output of gut bacterial communities. The goal of the current proposal is to unravel the biochemical pathway for IPA synthesis in C. sporogenes and to establish methods for increasing its production within the gut. The specific aims are to: 1) Determine how metabolic engineering and nutrient availability influence IPA production by Clostridium sporogenes in vitro, and 2) Develop strategies for ecosystem restructuring to promote therapeutic IPA production in the mouse gut. We will leverage newly developed genetic tools to understand how and why gut bacteria produce IPA. Using this information, we will assemble synthetic microbial communities in the gut designed to promote colonization by IPA producing bacteria. Finally, we will use these communities to reprogram IPA levels in mice and test whether we can protect against experimental colitis. The outcomes of these aims will represent the first steps toward controlling the metabolic output of gut bacteria for clinical benefit. This knowledge will be broadly relevant to modulating other microbial metabolites implicated in human diseases such as uremia, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and autism. The proposed research is part of a mentored career development plan to achieve an academic career studying host-microbe interactions. The principal investigator is a PhD-trained microbiologist with training in Clinical Pathology. My goal as an independent scientist is to understand the microbial contribution to the biochemical inventory within our body. The mentor for this project is Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, a pioneer in studying the contribution of gut bacteria to host biology. The career development plan includes a research advisory board, a career development committee, seminars in microbial physiology, formal coursework in bacterial genetics and ecology, and presentations at microbiome and human metabolic conferences. These activities will provide the necessary environment and experiences for developing an independent research career."
"9528269","PROJECT SUMMARY We will perform an initial test of viability for a new technique that promises to rapidly and accurately serotype Salmonella isolates. Over 400 deaths, 20k+ hospitalizations and 1.2M illnesses in the United States each year are caused by Salmonella according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Salmonella Atlas 2013). This pathogen causes the most gastroenteritis and can cause invasive, life threatening infections. Containment of outbreaks requires additional strain characterization to the serotype level. Serotypes are established according to the Kauffman-White scheme, which enables the ability to track and identify outbreaks and a method to determine the success of control efforts.  The current serotyping methods are laborious, resulting in high cost and delayed delivery of information. The cost (including capital, facilities, and training) limits its wide spread use. The burden of serotyping falls to state and local public health labs, national reference labs, and government labs. The delays occur from shipping and confirmation of species using conventional techniques and can take up to ten days to obtain results. These delays provide more time for contaminated food vectors to remain in consumer hands and create further infections.  We have begun to develop a microdevice technology based on dielectrophoresis that differentiates specific pathogens based on their biophysical properties. This approach is in distinct contrast to genotyping, expression profiles, phenotyping, or metabolic tests, all of which require the laborious procedures and resources noted. Pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. coli have been differentiated using this strategy and gentamicin resistant S. epidermidis and S. aureus have been isolated from their susceptible strains. Data and theory suggests each serotype can be selectively isolated and concentrated thus providing its identity.  This proposal is limited to producing a proof-of-principle data set by evaluating the CDC Salmonella validation kit to understand if this strategy is worth further pursuit. An optimized device will be developed and sample property requirements established. The proposed work will directly assess the sensitivity and specificity and provide an estimate for the speed of identification and a rough estimate of the cost. If the data suggest this is a viable strategy, future studies can include characterization of further isolates, more accurate estimates of cost, precise determination of speed, and the development of user-friendly and handheld interfaces. The upside for biophysical serotyping is excellent: results in minutes, minimal cost, wide distribution, and no cold-chain reagents."
"9522518","Project Summary  Goal-directed behavior is dependent on a constellation of ?executive? cognitive and behavioral processes dependent on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and extended frontostriatal circuitry. Dysregulation of PFC-dependent cognition and behavior is associated with numerous psychopathologies, including ADHD. Currently there is a dire need for improved treatments for frontostriatal dysregulation. For example, while psychostimulants are highly effective in the treatment of ADHD, they lack full efficacy across the broader patient population and are increasingly subject to abuse. Unfortunately, the development of novel pharmacological treatments for PFC dependent cognitive dysfunction is limited by a scarcity of alternative targets. From this perspective, it is of interest that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its receptors are prominent in the PFC. In recently completed studies, we demonstrated that CRF receptor blockade within the caudal dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) improves working memory in male rats, similar to all approved drug treatments for ADHD. Thus, CRF may represent a novel target for the development of new treatments for PFC-dependent cognitive dysfunction. The proposed multidisciplinary studies will provide a better understanding of the broader cognitive actions of CRF neurotransmission in the PFC in males and females and identify the circuit mechanisms responsible for these actions. Aim 1 will determine the broader impact of PFC CRF receptors across PFC-dependent cognitive processes in both males and females using intra-PFC infusions of CRF and CRF antagonists. Aim 2 uses recently developed viral vector-based chemogenetic manipulations of PFC CRF neurons combined with intra-PFC infusions of a CRF antagonist to determine whether local neurons are a primary source of CRF for PFC CRF receptors. Finally, Aim 3 uses ensemble neuronal recordings to determine the extent to which PFC CRF receptors and neurons impair neuronal coding within the dorsomedial frontostriatal circuit. Collectively, these studies will provide novel insight into the neurobiology of frontostriatal-dependent cognition. In doing so, these studies may provide a better understanding of the neural bases of PFC cognitive dysfunction and lead to novel treatment strategies for PFC-dependent cognitive dysfunction."
"9443584","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Conventional protocols for adult and pediatric tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment monitoring rely heavily on time-consuming bacterial culture or unquantifiable DNA detection methods for the presence of small numbers of bacteria. For pediatric TB, diagnosis and treatment are particularly difficult because current clinical protocols demand much from these young patients. Although they comprise a small percentage of the health care caseload, children who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB represent one of the most vulnerable groups with one of the highest mortality rates. We choose this challenging cohort (provided by a NIAID-sponsored clinical trial) to push the boundaries of what our technology platform can do. In order to address the current limitations in clinical management of pediatric TB, we have developed a rapid blood-based diagnostic method independent of mycobacterial isolation to quantify the low molecular- weight Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigens (CFP-10 and ESAT-6). Characteristics of ESAT-6 and CFP- 10 make them ideal biomarkers for active TB diagnosis and candidates for TB vaccine development. Our strategy combines energy mediating porous silicon nanodisks (referred to as pSiND), functionalized with customized antibodies highly specific to Mtb antigen peptides, and high-throughput mass spectrometry (NanoDisk-MS) for dual enhancement of sensitivity and specificity. We evaluated our platform with 292 adult and 102 pediatric patients and controls chosen from five highly relevant cohorts (active TB, HIV/TB co- infection, pediatric TB, latent TB, and non-TB mycobacterial infection), provided by multiple institutes worldwide. Sensitivities and specificities of adults (90.7% / 97.7%) and children (88.2% / 100%) were achieved in active TB identification. Absolute quantification of circulating antigens was informative in detecting treatment response four days after anti-mycobacterial initiation. Just as important, we could render accurate diagnoses within one hour of sample-to-answer processing rather than wait the typical 4-6 weeks. In this proposal, we aim to: 1) design and develop the scale-up nanodisk microfabrication protocol with FDA compliant in cGMP facilities; 2) conduct an extensive clinical validation of pSiND-MS using samples from a large cohort of children with HIV/TB; 3) determine effectiveness of our approach for rapid evaluation of treatment efficacy; and 4) optimize development and clinical validation of a portable pSiDN-miniMS system for identification and quantification of CFP-10 and ESAT-6. The pSiND-MS technology platform has an added advantage in that high-throughput and accurate mass spectrometry has become a virtually essential technology for clinical diagnosis in many parts of the world. The miniaturized and easy-to-use MS system at a shoebox size for point-of-care applications is aimed at serving patients in resource-limited areas. Achievement of all of our aims will significantly alter clinica management strategies for global TB control, and potentially improve diagnosis of other infectious diseases by quantifying circulating antigens of pathogenic organisms."
"9658923","ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke."
"9540195","Project Summary: Our goal is to find new ways to diagnose, treat and prevent life-threatening bowel motility disorders like chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) and Hirschsprung Disease (HSCR). Bowel motility is essential for life and is coordinated by a complex, gut-intrinsic network of neurons and glia called the enteric nervous system (ENS). Children with neuropathic CIPO have enteric neurons throughout the bowel, but have defects in neuron function that cause inadequate gut motility for survival and growth. In contrast, children with HSCR are born without enteric neurons at the end of the bowel. This causes tonic distal bowel contraction and functional obstruction. HSCR is treated by surgical removal of bowel without neurons, but bowel motility problems often persist after surgery, suggesting that neuron function in more proximal bowel regions is impaired despite the presence of enteric neurons. Twenty years ago, mutations in the Dlx1 and Dlx2 transcription factors were reported to cause deadly bowel motility defects in mice, but this observation was never pursued. Dlx1-/- mice die at one month of age, while Dlx2-/- mice, and mice lacking both DLX1 and DLX2, die shortly after birth with defective intestinal peristalsis and massive proximal small bowel distention due to air accumulation. Although DLX1 and DLX2 are essential for central nervous system (CNS) interneuron differentiation, survival, and migration, their role in ENS development and function is not known. The ENS is derived primarily from vagal neural crest precursors that invade the foregut and migrate rostro-caudally down the bowel before differentiating into neurons and glia. DLX1 and DLX2 are expressed in the developing ENS at ages relevant to neuron precursor migration, differentiation, and development. My preliminary data show that mice lacking DLX1 and DLX2 have delayed intestinal transit and reduced or absent neurally-mediated contractions in their small intestine. However, these mice have neurons throughout their bowel. Therefore, I hypothesize that DLX1 and DLX2 are essential for differentiation of specific subtypes of enteric neurons, consistent with the role of these proteins in the developing CNS. Because the ENS depends on integrated circuits and contains ~20 different neuron types, defects in enteric neuron differentiation and function can cause the observed bowel phenotype. To test this hypothesis, I will identify structural and functional defects in the ENS of Dlx1-/-, Dlx2-/-, and Dlx1/2-/- mice. I will also investigate genes regulated by DLX1 and DLX2 in the ENS using RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR. In addition, I will test the hypothesis that bowel motility defects in Dlx1-/- and Dlx2-/- mice occur because DLX1 and DLX2 regulate Zfhx1b in the ENS. Zfhx1b is a transcriptional regulator that is known to be controlled by DLX1 and DLX2 in some CNS neurons. ZFHX1B mutations cause HSCR, as well as CNS defects in humans and mice. These studies will elucidate unexplored roles for DLX1 and DLX2 during ENS maturation, and should facilitate development of new treatments for CIPO and HSCR, two life-threatening bowel motility disorders."
"9663149","Project Summary: The Kansas City-New Vaccine Surveillance Network (KC-NVSN) program was established in 2009 to conduct population-based, laboratory-confirmed, active surveillance of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) illness in children seeking care at Children's Mercy Hospital, in Kansas City (KC), MO. The program was subsequently expanded in 2015 to include hospitalized ARI children in inpatient (IP) settings. In the current proposal, the KC-NVSN program seeks to continue the existing pediatric AGE IP and outpatient (OP) surveillance in the six county KC metropolitan area and ARI IP surveillance in Jackson County, MO. In addition, we will expand ARI surveillance to OP from Jackson County visiting the main CMH emergency department. Age and time matched healthy control children will also be enrolled. Eligible children visiting or admitted to our hospital system as defined above will be enrolled using permission and assent forms approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of CMH. We will conduct parent interviews, collect medical chart data and retrieve hard copies of vaccine information for influenza and rotavirus from enrolled children. Clinical specimens collected from children will be tested for rotavirus (and other GI pathogens, e.g. norovirus in proposed subprojects) in stool and 22 respiratory pathogens from respiratory specimen including specific influenza subtypes and other non-influenza viruses, such as RSV, EV-D68 etc. The data collected from the KC-NVSN program will provide population-based estimates to address the following specific aims: 1. To assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing medically attended rotavirus and influenza  illness by the test-negative case-control study design using laboratory confirmed testing among  enrolled children. 2. To assess the burden of select AGE pathogens and non-influenza viral pathogens, including  respiratory syncytial virus and EV-D68 among enrolled children. The KC-NVSN program will provide data to be combined with other geographically diverse sites to estimate the national incidence, burden, and etiology of community-acquired AGE and ARI. The VE for rotavirus and seasonal influenza vaccinations will be calculated to measure the impact of vaccination. This network will also address several important scientific questions related to natural history of pediatric infectious diseases, transmission dynamics, impact of vaccine on targeted and vulnerable population and factors that influence vaccine effectiveness. The surveillance data generated from this network will provide timely and highly useful data to inform public health measures and pediatric vaccine-related policies aimed at controlling AGE and ARI in US children."
"9644301","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed project, Gold nanoparticle-based mercury analyzer for on-site measurements of soil and sediment, will develop a powerful and portable mercury analyzer. This project will continue the work from Phase I, by combining the nanoparticle based detector with a thermal/catalytic sample introduction system. Gold nanoparticle-based plasmonic mercury sensing is inexpensive, ultra-sensitive, and ideal for portable applications. The thermal/catalytic sample introduction system will be low power, with low sample loss and high throughput; it also does not require the use of wet chemicals or other consumables. The commercial instrument resulting from combining these two subsystems will be lightweight (<20lbs), sensitive to levels of concern for remediation (<6mg/kg Hg), and operate on battery power. Extensive field-testing will be conducted to ensure the mercury sensor is suitable for replacing the current costly and time-consuming laboratory methods. The development of such a device will benefit all parties concerned with mercury monitoring and the remediation of contaminated sites. Mercury monitoring costs hundreds of millions of dollars a year across diverse scientific, industrial, and regulatory groups. The fundamental issue these groups address is protecting human health, and the environment, from the risks of mercury pollution."
"9431208","Project Summary Perception and cognition rely on processing performed in a distributed network of cortical areas. These areas communicate through feedforward, lateral, and feedback corticocortical connections. Our long-term goal is to understand the function of corticocortical feedback circuitry, which has been proposed to underlie a number of functions but remains poorly understood. Previous work has attempted to elucidate the function of feedback by reversibly inactivating higher cortex with either pharmacological or cooling methods, and measuring effects in single neurons in lower cortex. While important, this previous work suffers from critical limitations. Inactivation has limited specificity, usually involving large swaths of cortex and thus neurons with different functional properties. Measuring the consequences on lower cortex using only single neuron firing rates would fail to capture any effects of feedback on network coordination, which much recent work suggests may be central to cortical function. Previous studies have also often neglected to determine the laminar location of their recordings: feedback connections are laminar-specific, thus their effects may vary through the targeted cortical columns. In this study we will use optogenetic methods, combined with multielectrode neurophysiology, to elucidate the function of corticocortical feedback in the macaque visual cortex. Guided by preliminary results, our working hypothesis is that these connections are functionally-specific and alter the coordination among targeted neurons. This coordination may in turn enhance the coupling to downstream target networks. In specific aim 1, we will test how optogenetic recruitment and silencing of small populations of neurons in cortical area V2 affects neuronal responsivity and tuning across layers of primary visual cortex (V1). Using the local field potential and small ensembles of simultaneously-recorded neurons, we will also measure how network coordination is affected by manipulating feedback. We will measure effects both in the presence and absence of visual drive, to determine how the effects of feedback depend on network state. Finally, we will evaluate how the effects of feedback depend on the functional and retinotopic alignment of the stimulation and recording site. In specific aim 2, we will use planar electrode arrays to explore in detail the effects of feedback on the coordination of large neuronal ensembles in the superficial layers of V1, the primary output population projecting to higher visual cortex. Our experiments will provide an unprecedented view of how feedback modulates V1, how these effects depend on the relationship between the functional properties of the source and target neurons, and how feedback interacts with bottom-up sensory information. This work will form a solid basis for future work in which we will use optogenetic methods to manipulate circuits in a perceptual decision making paradigm. Disrupted corticocortical signaling has been implicating in a number of disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. By furthering our understanding of the signals provided from higher to lower cortex, our results will contribute to improved diagnosis and treatment of such disorders.  "
"9472774","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tendinopathy results in progressive tendon degeneration and is associated with pain, progressive muscle weakness, and ultimately tendon failure. In the shoulder, tendinopathy of the rotator cuff affects 30% of individuals over 60 years of age, and impairs their ability to perform common activities of daily living. These injuries are managed conservatively and/or surgically. Tendon tear size, chronicity, muscle retraction, fatty muscle atrophy, and fibrosis are interrelated characteristics of rotator cuff tears and are associated with poor outcomes. Importantly, these muscle changes appear to be insensitive to rehabilitation even in the presence of a successful surgical repair of the tendon. We have recently developed an injectable, tissue specific extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel, which is derived from decellularized porcine skeletal muscle, and have shown that it promotes muscle regeneration via increasing vascularization, enhancing the recruitment and proliferation of muscle progenitors, and reducing cell death. These findings lead to our overall theoretical framework for a high impact intervention aimed at improving muscle recovery and ultimately functional outcomes. Specifically, progressive tendon degeneration leads to progressive muscle retraction, which ultimately causes overwhelming degeneration. Therefore, a regenerative stimulus at the time of muscle reloading (surgical tendon repair) is required to initiate long-term tissue recovery. Our broad central hypothesis is that chronic muscle atrophy and degeneration are reversible with surgical tendon repair plus an injection of a skeletal muscle ECM hydrogel. Specific Aim 1 will measure acute (5 days) histological, protein, and gene expression changes in a rabbit model of chronically degenerated muscle after surgical rotator cuff tendon repair and ECM hydrogel injections. Specific Aim 2 will measure subacute (8 weeks post-repair) physiological, histological, and protein changes in these chronically degenerated muscles after surgical tendon repair and ECM hydrogel injections. These experiments will determine if muscle recovery occurs after delivering a supplemental, low-cost, non cell-based regenerative therapy during surgical tendon repair in a chronically degenerated muscle. We expect a near term impact on surgery and rehabilitation because these findings will provide evidence for preliminary human trials. Together, the PIs have a long-standing history of productivity in preclinical and human experiments for rotator cuff disease, and translation of ECM hydrogels into patients, so we are well suited to execute and rapidly translate these experiments to humans."

DESCRIPTION:  Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. In this application the OVN has been expanded to be a node of networks: the Ohio Valley Node-Network (OVNN). The OVNN includes eight original OVN sites, which are located in 6 states and treat more than 225,000 patients per year; and three additional practice based research networks (PBRNs). Two are state-wide primary care PBRNs, the Collaborative Ohio Inquiry Network (COIN) and the Wisconsin Research and Education Network (WREN), which, combined, include more than 350 practices and treat more than 4 million patients per year. The third is a state-wide pharmacy PBRN in Indiana, which includes 168 pharmacies that fill 1.5 million prescriptions annually. These Midwestern sites and partnerships will contribute needed diversity to CTN clinical trials. The OVNN Research Core is the driving force of the OVNN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVNN co-investigators include experts in primary care (Elder), emergency medicine (Lyons), and pediatric emergency medicine (Grupp- Phelan) practice-based research. The 7 members of the OVN research-implementation team bring 72 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. A primary goal of the application is to conduct the research needed to inform clinical practice guidelines for effective substance use disorder (SUD) prevention and treatment in general medical care settings, which are largely lacking but increasingly needed, with a specific focus on research to address the opioid abuse epidemic. Our proposed research agenda includes pragmatic clinical trials testing interventions to predict, prevent, and respond to opioid misuse in primary care; to reduce the reoccurrence of opioid overdose by linking patients treated for an overdose in emergency medicine departments to SUD treatment through a novel peer-based intervention; and to reduce the transmission of HIV and HCV through pharmacy-based testing for buprenorphine-treated patients."
"9493658","Abstract We are requesting funds for the purchase of an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos tandem mass spectrometer and liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific) to be used for qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses. This instrument will greatly expand the proteomic capabilities of the University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory and the services it offers to its user-base throughout the University of Rochester and Western New York. This instrument will fill critical gaps in our current proteomic capabilities including label free and isobaric quantitation, top-down analysis of intact proteins, analysis of post- translational modifications and deep coverage shotgun proteomics. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have provided powerful tools for high-throughput analysis of proteins that are widely employed in medical and biological research. Proteomic analyses are typically used for discovery applications and in clinical or analytical screens that require large-scale target detection and quantification of complex protein mixtures. Due to its potential for high impact on existing NIH-funded research programs and Centers, the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) has targeted proteomics as an area of critical development. The University's commitment to developing and supporting the Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory has been essential for providing accessibility to modern mass spectrometry resources, services and expertise for the University of Rochester and Western New York research communities. The facility has experienced a dramatic increase in demand in recent years, spurred in part by an overall shortage of accessibility to high-end mass spectrometers in the region. The requested Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer is a versatile instrument that excels at high- throughput and high-resolution applications, at a level far beyond the capabilities of the current mass spectrometers in the core facility. In this application, 11 major users and 2 minor users provide project descriptions that impact at least 13 NIH research grants. The diversity of users highlights the importance of this technology and the unmet level of need that will be addressed by the instrument. The need for sensitive high-throughput, high-resolution mass spectrometry is rapidly growing in the Medical Center and the College that encompass over 45 departments and research centers, and over 800 research laboratories. To ensure the highest level of access to proteomic technology and services, the requested instrument will be housed in the URMC Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory. Two dedicated core staff members will run the instrument, and the core staff and core director will manage projects, provide consulting, analyze data, and assist users with data interpretation and processing. Data storage, analysis, and processing will be performed at the University of Rochester's Center for Integrated Research Computing (CIRC), which manages a 144-core processor server for the facility. Institutional support and oversight will ensure that state-of-the-art mass spectrometry services are developed and accessible to the research community. !"
"9393347","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this five-year project is to use advanced imaging and biomarker techniques to improve strategies for diagnosing the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a common complication of critical illnesses such as sepsis, and affects over 200,000 patients annually in the United States. ARDS mortality exceeds 30%. As yet, few effective therapies have been found. A major reason for this lack of progress is the difficulty in accurately diagnosing ARDS, leading to difficulty in studying potentil treatments.  ARDS is characterized by inflammation-induced pulmonary edema that leads to severe respiratory failure. However, other conditions such as heart failure (HF) may also cause respiratory failure and pulmonary edema despite having very different pathophysiologic causes, and therefore different treatments. Traditional diagnostic methods include clinical criteria and radiography, which have proven to lack precision in distinguishing ARDS from other illnesses.  Recent advances in imaging have demonstrated that lung inflammation and lung edema can be quantified with Computed Tomography/Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) scanning, by measuring uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (18F-FDG) and 15O-water activity (H215O). A combination of these methods might have potential for improving the diagnosis of ARDS, but has not yet been studied in humans.  This project will adapt PET/CT methods to provide functional in vivo lung imaging, with the goal of distinguishing between patients with pulmonary edema due to ARDS and those with pulmonary edema due to HF. This would enable treatment targeted to the underlying biology of the patient's illness, and would help ensure that patients of the appropriate phenotype are enrolled into ARDS clinical studies. This project will also utilize these results to develop a plasma biomarker test for this diagnostic purpose. Specifically, levels of soluble ST2 (sST2), a cytokine receptor that has been studied as novel biomarker of immune tolerance, and which plays a role in myocardial fibrosis and remodeling, will be validated for detection of pulmonary inflammation as demonstrated by PET/CT imaging. Specific aims of the project are as follows: SPECIFIC AIM 1: We will perform PET/CT imaging of critically ill patients to compare lung inflammation (18F- FDG) and pulmonary edema (H215O) in ARDS vs. HF, and compare these with a novel model using 18F-FDG data alone to quantify inflammation and edema. We hypothesize that PET/CT imaging will enable separation of subjects into diagnostic groups according to underlying pulmonary inflammation and edema. SPECIFIC AIM 2: We will test the relationship between lung inflammation and novel biomarker sST2. We hypothesize that plasma concentration of sST2 can be used as a surrogate for imaging to detect lung inflammation, and thus can enable diagnostic separation of subjects according to the presence of this process."
"9446784","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of globalization and economic advancement countries like South Africa (SA) are experiencing a risk transition in which disease prevalence is shifting from being primarily infectious in nature to being primarily non-communicable in nature. This is presenting significant challenges for the health care systems of countries with scarce resources. In the U.S. evidence from large, rigorous RCT's clearly indicate that lifestyle interventions such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) can enable overweight individuals to change their diet and physical activity levels and significantly reduce their risk for diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular (CVD) diseases but the program has not been adapted for delivery in a developing word setting. The purpose of this proposal is to adapt the DPP and evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness in an urban settlement community in SA. Three initial adaptations to the DPP are proposed for this setting: (1) deliver treatment in a group format using community health workers (CHWs); (2) enhance the DPP through interactive text messaging; and (3) enhance CHW's communications skills through simplified Motivational Interviewing (MI) training. The RE-AIM model will be used to guide our intervention adaptations in order to maximize public health impact. Feasibility and effectiveness of the DPP-SA will be assessed in a real world trial using a large team of CHWs currently deployed in this community to help overweight/obese individuals with DM and/or CVD. We plan a 2 year cluster-randomized trial in which we will randomize 54 existing health clubs (N=540) to receive the DPP South Africa (DPP-SA) or usual care (wait-list). The primary outcome analysis will compare percentage of baseline weight loss at Y1 between DPP-SA and usual care; however, after Y1 usual care participants will also receive the DPP-SA and both groups will be followed for another year. This will allow us to assess whether the wait-list group's results after 1 year of treatment are similar to the original group's outcomes and examine whether the original group maintains its outcomes over 2 years. Secondary outcomes will include DM and cardiovascular risk indicators (blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, lipids), changes in medication use, diet (fat and fruit and vegetable intake), physical activity, and health related quality of life. Feasibilityand process outcomes will be assessed among NGO staff, CHWs, and participants. We will also prepare the DPP-SA for dissemination through development of training curricula, establishing university training courses, engaging other stakeholders who are candidates for dissemination, and assessing the cost-effectiveness of the intervention with respect to cost per kg of weight loss and key secondary outcomes."
"9433864","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is considered a critical part of COPD treatment, reducing breathlessness, increasing health-related quality of life, and decreasing health care utilization. However, only a small portion of patients with COPD access PR due to transportation issues, or the frailty of patients. Home-based PR has been found useful, but has not been implemented due to the lack of available PR programs and systems which continuously monitor the patient's safety and progress. Self-management support (SM), as proposed in the chronic care model and in international COPD guidelines, is not widely implemented. Pulmonary rehabilitation represents a unique opportunity for SM given the meaningful engagement and communication existing with a care provider through the program. In this application, we propose to test the effectiveness of a home-based PR system developed in our previous research project which would make PR feasible in the patient's own home with accurate monitoring and feedback and SM support through a health coach. The proposed system fills a knowledge/practice gap in COPD care by increasing access to PR which may translate to improved well-being and heath care outcomes. This simple, yet highly innovative home?based PR system which uses commercially available monitors will promote higher adherence to PR and to SM support and lead to a sustained improvement of well-being."
"9457686","PROJECT SUMMARY Approximately 20% of breast cancer (BC) is caused by overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), on the basis of which anti-HER2 therapies have been developed. Although these drugs have benefited BC patients, development of resistance and disease recurrence continue to be the major clinical challenges. These clinical problems warrant studies on alternative therapeutic strategies to treat HER2-positive BC. In this application, we propose to develop a new targeted therapy through pharmacological inhibition of the Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2), which acts by blocking HER2 and switch oncogene overexpression. As opposed to the existing anti-HER2 drugs that act by inactivating the already expressed protein, targeting SHP2 has the potential to block the process of overexpression. We predict that targeting SHP2 that controls multiple signaling pathways is more effective and at the same time eliminates the need for developing drugs against multiple targets. In addition, targeting SHP2 can reduce toxicities associated with the use of drug cocktails and enormously cuts the cost of treatment. In line with this concept, we have invented a specific small molecule SHP2 inhibitor (WGMDY) that shows promising anti-cancer effects in naïve and anti-HER2 drug resistant cells in culture and in vivo. In this study, we will investigate the potential of SHP2 as a drug target and WGMDY as an anti-cancer agent. The overall hypothesis is that pharmacological targeting of SHP2 induces remission of both treatment-naïve and anti-HER2 drug resistant cells and tumors. To attain these goals, three specific aims have been proposed. First (Specific aim #1), we will determine the effect of pharmacological targeting of SHP2 on oncogene expression, cell proliferation, transformation, and cancer stem cell properties. Second (Specific aim #2), we will determine maximum tolerable dose, toxicity, bioavailability, and stability of WGMDY in vivo. And third (Specific aim #3), we will determine the anti-cancer activity of SHP2 targeting with WGMDY in primary spontaneous and xenograft models and in brain metastatic models. The outcome of the proposed study can show the potential of SHP2 as a drug target and the viability of the anti-SHP2 compound as a lead molecule for future development of anti-SHP2 drugs."
"9442792","Abstract  Scotopic vision is initiated upon capture of a photon of light by rhodopsin molecules present in rod photoreceptor cells. The activation of the light receptor rhodopsin sets into motion a series of biochemical reactions called phototransduction, which leads to the hyperpolarization of the cell. The long-term goal of this research program is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the biochemical events in phototransduction under normal and diseased states. The current focus is on rhodopsin. The importance of this molecule extends beyond its central role in phototransduction. Rhodopsin plays an important structural role and is essential for the proper formation and health of photoreceptor cells. The rhodopsin gene is a hot spot for mutations causing inherited vision disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and congenital night blindness, which currently have no cure. Rhodopsin is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor and therefore findings here can provide insights on other members of this superfamily of proteins that share commonalities in structure and mechanisms of action. Despite the wealth of knowledge available for rhodopsin, an accurate mechanism of its action is still unavailable and a mechanistic description on the effect of mutations in the light receptor causing vision disorders is incomplete. The current proposal is based on findings from the previous funding period that were in support of paradigms expanding on classical dogma; namely, the notion that rhodopsin forms a supramolecular structure in both healthy and diseased states and is able to achieve multiple active states, some of which may manifest only in disease. The aims of this proposal examine these paradigms in more detail and consider the implications in photoreceptor cell biology and retinal disease. In the first aim, determinants of the observed membrane organization of rhodopsin in photoreceptor cells will be characterized. In the second aim, the misfolding and aggregation of rhodopsin mutants causing retinitis pigmentosa will be characterized in cells and mouse models. In the third aim, the origin of constitutive activity in rhodopsin mutants will be characterized to better assess the mechanism of diseases such as congenital night blindness and Leber congenital amaurosis. Significant technological advances are required to overcome the intrinsic difficulties in studying membrane proteins to observe native structural and molecular details that are important to better understand the system. This proposal utilizes several innovative biophysical methods including atomic force microscopy, Förster resonance energy transfer, and Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy. Results from our studies will lead to a more accurate mechanistic framework to understand the function of the system under normal conditions and dysfunctions in inherited retinal diseases, which will provide new avenues for scientific inquiry. The long-term impact in addressing fundamental aspects of rhodopsin structure and function will lead to the development of targeted therapeutics and discovery of novel drug targets."
"9548811","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-typhoidal Salmonella are major causes of inflammatory diarrhea, causing an estimated 1.4 million cases per year in the United States. The vast majority of patients develop gastroenteritis, a self-limiting intestinal infection characterized by inflammatory diarrhea. Though intestinal inflammation is protective as it prevents Salmonella dissemination and bacteremia in healthy individuals, inflammation also enhances Salmonella replication in the gut via several mechanisms. Relevant to this proposal are the mechanisms by which Salmonella compete for the essential metal nutrient iron in the inflamed gut. As levels of free iron in the host are low, Salmonella biosynthesize and export small iron-scavenging molecules termed siderophores that include enterochelin and salmochelins. During Salmonella infection, the mammalian host secretes the antimicrobial protein lipocalin-2. This protein binds to the siderophore enterochelin and thereby prevents microbes from utilizing enterochelin as an iron source. Salmochelins enable Salmonella to overcome lipocalin-2-dependent iron starvation and thrive in the inflamed gut. These siderophores are C-glucosylated forms of enterochelin that are too large to fit into the enterochelin-binding pocket of lipocalin- 2. Notably, a host-defense mechanism for blocking salmochelin-mediated iron uptake by Salmonella has not been identified. The primary objective of this application is to develop new vaccination strategies to limit iron acquisition by non-typhoidal Salmonella in the intestine. To this end, we propose to develop mucosal vaccines against enterochelin/salmochelin to inhibit iron acquisition by and reduce the growth of non- typhoidal Salmonella. We will also investigate the impact of enterochelin/salmochelin immunization on the global immune response to Salmonella infection and on the intestinal microbiota. Finally, we will ascertain whether administration of antibodies blocking enterochelin/salmochelin-mediated iron acquisition has a protective and/or a therapeutic effect upon infection with Salmonella."
"9546099","Project Summary The overall goal of this project is to develop a rectal probe for minimally intrusive highly accurate risk stratification with the vision of utilizing it for a precision medicine approach to colon cancer screening and also potentially chemoprevention (companion biomarker). We will employ cutting edge biophotonics (ISOCT) and biological approaches combined with large scale human studies to elucidate the clinical/biological implications of mucosal early increase in blood supply (EIBS). Our multi-disciplinary group has extensively reported on EIBS in two animal models and human studies (n>1000) through the development of cutting-edge biophotonics technology namely the polarization gated spectroscopy (PGS) and more recently inverse spectroscopic optical coherence tomography (ISOCT). Clinically, rectal EIBS had excellent diagnostics of advanced adenomas (AUC >0.8) albeit impacted somewhat by race and gender. Biologically, our data on early colonic mucosal metabolic reprogramming (Warburg like effect) in both animal models and humans provides a potential mechanism for EIBS. For Causational Insights, pilot animal studies demonstrated that targeting microcirculation with the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan decreased EIBS with a concomitant suppression of colonic tumorigenesis. Furthermore, chemopreventive agents appear to reverse the Warburg-like physiology in the premalignant colonic mucosa. We hypothesize that EIBS is a manifestation of metabolic reprogramming that can be detectable with unprecedented accuracy with ISOCT. In aim 1 (technology), we will develop and validate the ISOCT fiberoptic probe and ascertain its accuracy for determining hemoglobin concentration, oxygenation status and blood vessel diameter at various superficial tissue depths. In aim 2 (biomarker), we will develop and validate a rectal EIBS prediction rule for the presence of advanced adenomas with prediction rule optimized for gender & race using biomarkers related to hemoglobin oxygenation, depth and blood vessel radius and density aiming for sensitivity & specificity ?90%. For metabolic physiological correlates, we will interrogate the short term primary colon biopsy cell cultures via the extracellular flux analysis (Seahorse) as a physiological marker of Warburg. We will correlate with ISOCT readings and neoplasia presence (race/gender specific) along with the expressions of genes implicated in Warburg. In aim 3 (causational insight), we will perform animal studies to determine whether targeting the EIBS and secondary metabolic events using losartan (angiotensin 2 inhibitor) and metformin (promising chemopreventive agent known to reverse Warburg effects) would be a potential adenoma prevention strategy. Biologically, this study will provide definitive confirmation that EIBS is an important effector of metabolic reprogramming in colon carcinogenesis. Clinically, a rectal EIBS would be minimally intrusive and could be employed in the primary care setting to determine need for colonoscopy and also titrate or discontinue chemopreventive agents in order not to expose patients who do not derive a therapeutic benefit to the cost/toxicity of these agents. This new paradigm may herald the era of precision medicine in CRC prevention."
"9438537","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hierarchical feedforward models have provided a foundation for most theories of visual processing over the past 40 years. However, in the cerebral cortex there is a dense network of feedback (FB) connections sending topdown information from higher to lower processing centers. The anatomy and function of FB circuits is still poorly understood. This is despite the fact that FB has been implicated in many important visual functions such as contextual modulation, attention and learning. The goal of this application is to understand the anatomical and functional organization of FB connections from the secondary (V2) to the primary visual cortex (V1), and the impact of V2 FB on V1 cell responses. We will test the following hypotheses: 1. Anatomically, V2 FB consists of parallel channels, related to the stripe compartments of V2, with each channel targeting specific V1 layers, V1 compartments and the same V1 cells that provide input to the specific V2 stripe (Aim 1). The different channels also show unique specificities with respect to the functional maps of visual stimulus properties in V1 (Aim 2). 2. Functionally, V2 FB contributes to surround modulation (SM) caused by visual stimulation of the surround regions near the V1 cell's receptive field (RF) (Aim 3). SM is the ability of stimuli in the RF surround to modulate the responses of V1 cells to stimuli inside the RF, a property thought to serve efficient coding of natural images and segmentation of object boundaries (Nurminen & Angelucci, 2014) Ref43.  Our understanding of FB anatomy and function has been hampered by the technical limitations of previous methods used to label FB axons and manipulate their activity. Conventional tracers are either poorly sensitive or label axons bidirectional, creating a confound in the interpretation of the axon label. As a result, there are conflicting reports regarding the anatomical and functional specificity of FB connections. Inactivation of FB systems has been performed using methods that lack spatiotemporal precision and cell type selectivity, affecting cells in an entire cortical area. These approaches could not rule out that the effects of FB manipulation were mediated by other indirect pathways. To overcome these limitations, we will investigate the anatomical and functional organization of FB connections from V2 to V1, using novel viral-mediated expression of fluorescent proteins to label FB axons and their synaptic terminals unambiguously. In Aim 1 these labeling methods will be combined with staining of V1 layers and compartment (CO maps), and in Aim 2 with optical imaging of V1 functional maps. In Aim 3, manipulation of FB neuron activity will be performed using optogenetic activation of opsin-expressing FB axons, while determining the effects of these manipulations on spontaneous and visually-evoked spike activity in V1 cells, recorded using linear arrays. These data will provide an anatomical and mechanistic foundation for modeling and hypothesis-driven studies of FB function and dysfunction, and lead to a better understanding of the computations performed by this canonical cortical circuit, i.e. top down FB."

In the current proposal, we aim to enhance and strengthen a research training program between the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the Institute of Marine Biochemistry at the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (IMBC-VAST), and the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) in Hanoi, Vietnam. We aim to enhance host country basic and translational research capacity that focuses on the discovery and development of antibiotic leads for TB. Since the 1990s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have invested heavily in both clinical labs and HIV/AIDS/TB surveillance systems in Vietnam, though these and several other efforts have focused predominantly on building medical infrastructure. Our proposal will bridge this gap by enhancing basic and translational science research infrastructure and a researcher training program that focuses on utilizing host-country resources to discover antibiotic leads that will treat TB and probe its basic mechanisms of pathogenicity through coordinated antibiotic lead screening programs in Hanoi. The success of this program is driven by short- and long-term research training and education. UIC has a strong track record of collaboration with VAST. Through NIH and MacArthur Foundation funding in the past 20 years, the team has worked to build a plant-based drug-lead discovery and resource conservation program. However, with greater than 3,000 km of coastline, Vietnam harbors some of the richest marine biodiversity in the world, from which this proposal aims to mine. The aims of this program are 1) Establish three independent investigators at IMBC-VAST/NIHE via long-term postdoctoral training at UIC; 2) Provide short- and long-term antibiotic-specific training to nine IMBC/NIHE predoctoral students over the course of the program period; 3) Enhance biological assay research infrastructure through creation of an in vitro M. tuberculosis screening program at NIHE. In a five-year period, our program will generate twelve highly trained scientists who specialize in TB antibiotic discovery and development. Three of the twelve scientists ? with considerable institutional support from the Director and President of their respective institutes ? will establish independent research groups that complement a broader program that uses Vietnam's natural resources to discover TB antibiotics, and to use these leads to explore mechanisms of M. tuberculosis pathogenicity. Beyond the five-year project period, the significant enhancement in research capacity at IMBC and NIHE will establish northern Vietnam as a translational screening center for TB, and will facilitate collaboration with institutions across and outside Vietnam."
"9439792","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence demonstrates the benefits of diabetes self-management education (DSME) on diabetes knowledge and self-care behavior, clinical outcomes, quality of life, use of primary and preventive services, and lower costs. While the initial benefits of DSME are well documented, the effects decline approximately six months following DSME. Additionally, the majority of studies in this area are singularly focused and comparisons between multiple approaches are limited. The 2012 National Standards for DSME and Support emphasize the importance of providing both initial DSME and on-going diabetes self-management support (DSMS) to assist people with diabetes in maintaining effective self-management throughout a lifetime. While a great deal is understood about how to provide effective DSME, less is known about how to provide effective DSMS. Additionally, DSME is a covered benefit in the healthcare system, while DSMS is not. This ultimately limits access and availability of DSMS programs; therefore posing a critical need to develop, evaluate, and understand effective DSMS models that are ongoing, patient-driven, responsive to change, and embedded in existing community infrastructures. African-American churches are a potentially effective venue for delivering such interventions. The goal of this proposal is to examine the effectiveness of three DSMS approaches compared to enhanced usual care within the context of churches. A cluster randomized, practical behavioral trial with three parallel intervention groups will be implemented. Twenty-one churches in metro-Detroit will be randomized to either 1) Parish Nurse+Peer Leader DSMS 2) Parish Nurse DSMS, or 3) Peer Leader DSMS. All participants will begin with enhanced usual care and transition into the respective DSMS groups based on church membership. Each church will enroll 20-23 individuals with type 2 diabetes, who will be offered six weeks of DSME, followed by 12 months of support group sessions led by either the parish nurse, peer leader, or a combination of both. Following DSMS, all participants and churches will transition into a one-year period of on-going support to evaluate if participants parish nurses, and peer leaders sustain self-management efforts by capitalizing on the infrastructure of the church. We hypothesize that 1) participants in both Parish Nurse DSMS and Peer Leader DSMS will have improved outcomes over enhanced usual care, and that 2) participants in Parish Nurse + Peer Leader DSMS will sustain improvements in outcomes achieved following DSME at significantly higher levels than participants in Parish Nurse DSMS and Peer Leader DSMS. We anticipate that providing formal infrastructure and supervision for peer leaders is critical in the uptake of DSMS. All interventions will be superior to enhanced usual care. A similar pattern of findings is anticipated for blood pressure, weight, and quality of life. The cost effectiveness and long term impact of each approach will be determined. This information will have significant public health impact and will be pivotal in determining effective sustainable strategies and approaches to address DSMS in underserved communities."
"9447222","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization in older adults. Multiple re-hospitalizations, many of which are preventable, are common in HF and contribute substantially to the cumulative burden of illness and cost of care. The rate of HF re-hospitalization is higher in African-American than in white patients, for reasons that are poorly understood. Current HF readmission risk prediction models are inadequate, and re-hospitalization prevention efforts are ineffective. Research is needed on novel risk factors for HF re-hospitalization. Depression is one of the best candidates for further investigation. It is a prevalent comorbidity in HF, and preliminary evidence suggests that it may increase the rate of re-hospitalization. In addition, the progression of HF and multiple re-hospitalizations may contribute to the persistence or worsening of depression. Thus, there may be a reciprocal relationship between depression and multiple re-hospitalizations. This study will be the first to investigate both sides of this relationship, and to examine the impact of depression on the long-term risk of multiple re-hospitalizations instead of focusing more narrowly on the short-term risk of the first re-hospitalization. The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that depression is an independent predictor of recurrent hospitalizations and mortality in patients with heart failure. The secondary aim is to test the hypothesis that multiple hospitalizations predict persistent or worsening depression in patients with HF. Additional aims include investigating whether depression helps to explain the disproportionately high rate of HF re-hospitalizations in African-American patients, and identifying mediators of the relationship between depression and re-hospitalization. A cohort of 400 adult patients (200 African-American, 200 white) with HF will be enrolled in the study and followed for 2 years after their index hospitalization at a large, urban teaching hospital in St. Louis. At enrollment, a structured interview to diagnose DSM-5 depressive disorders will be administered along with questionnaires to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, social support, HF self-care, and HF-related functional impairment. Data on prior HF hospitalizations, HF severity measures, comorbidities, and medications will be extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) system. The depression questionnaire will be repeated every 3 months for 2 years. Hospitalizations and deaths will be ascertained by queries of the hospital's EMR system, interviews with the participants and collateral informants, medical records of admissions to other facilities, and the National Death Index. State-of-the-art methods for modeling recurrent events data will be used to analyze the time-dependent effect of depression on the rate of re-hospitalization and to determine whether it has more severe effects in African-American than in white patients. A linear mixed model will be used to evaluate the impact of multiple re-hospitalizations on the longitudinal course of depression. The findings will clarify the relationshp between depression and re-hospitalization in patients with heart failure, and help to identify novel targets for intervention."

The goal of the Illinois PRAMS Project is to help fulfill the IDPH mission to protect the health and wellness of the people of Illinois through prevention, health promotion, regulation, and the control of disease and injury. More specifically, the goal of the Illinois PRAMS Project is to collect high-quality data on maternal and early infancy behaviors and experiences and that the data collected meet the needs of IDPH and other state and private agencies. The data collected are used to assess maternal and child health (MCH) care needs, develop programs to improve MCH, and provide feedback on the effectiveness of these programs. PRAMS surveys are sent to a sample of Illinois women delivering live births and contain questions about maternal experiences and behaviors before and after childbirth and during the children's early infancy. New mothers are initially contacted by mail with all the materials needs to complete and return the surveys. Phone interviews are used to follow up with those mothers not responding by mail. The data collected are then weighted for sample size, non- response, and other factors to produce a data set that is represented of the target population of Illinois women giving birth in Illinois to live infants. PRAMS methods have been used in Illinois and other states for several years and have been shown to produce reliable information about the target population."

"9487362","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), continues to be one of the world?s deadliest infectious diseases because of several factors, including a) poor adherence to the long-term multidrug therapy, b) latent (or persistent) infection, c) co-infection with HIV and d) drug-resistant Mtb strains that are unaffected by current TB therapies. Similarly, Staphylococcus aureus was recently listed by the WHO as a ?high priority? pathogen in regards to new antibiotic development, due to its increasing prevalence as a major infectious agent both in hospitals and in the community, and to increased virulence and rising resistance against current antistaphylococcal agents. The biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), an essential cofactor relevant to several metabolic processes, contains an emerging set of targets for antibacterial drug design. Small molecule inhibitors of this pathway have shown activity in a cell-based model of latent TB, increasing interest in this set of targets as a potential means attacking the latent pathogen. Similarly, CoA biosynthesis in S. aureus has recently been associated with maintaining the organism under anaerobic conditions, a model for persistent infections. The broad, long-term objective of this project is to develop inhibitors of CoA biosynthesis, which act on the PPCS enzyme activity of Mtb and S. aureus, that show whole cell activity under a range of conditions and potential for further development as clinically useful agents that could be used in combination treatments. This goal has strong foundations in results from in vitro genetic studies demonstrating the vulnerability of the target, and in vivo experiments showing that depletion of PPCS activity is bactericidal and prevents a robust Mtb infection in mice. In S. aureus, a natural product that targets PPCS activity shows highly selective whole cell activity. These results suggest that the PPCS activity is a highly promising target that is tractable to inhibition by small molecules. To develop new whole cell active compounds, we are proposing inhibitor structures based on a well-established strategy that has successfully been used to prepare inhibitors of mechanistically similar enzymes, giving rise to compounds that also showed excellent whole cell activity against Mtb and S. aureus. In addition, we are proposing complementary metabolic activation and prodrug approaches to address the known challenge of preparing compounds that are able to cross the Mtb cell envelope. We will pursue this objective through three Specific Aims: 1) Design and synthesis of Pan-CMP mimics as PPCS inhibitors; 2) Biochemical evaluation of metabolic activation and PPCS inhibition of Aim 1 compounds; and 3) Evaluation of PPCS inhibitors in models of actively growing and persistent Mtb and S. aureus. These aims are formulated to systematically optimize the structure of the inhibitors and to follow their on-target activity and selectivity through enzymatic and whole cell assays, the latter including tests against wild-type Mtb and S. aureus and mutant Mtb strains (to show target specificity), models of latent/persistent growth for both Mtb and S. aureus, and an ex vivo macrophage model (in the case of Mtb)."

"9447104","Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are increasingly being recognized as important causes of invasive disease (e.g. sepsis, meningitis) in the very young and the elderly in the USA. The growing resistance of NTS strains to multiple antibiotics further complicates treatment. NTS disease in the USA is accounted for primarily by serovars belonging to three serogroups (B, C and D). Our overall goal is to develop a broad-spectrum vaccine against these invasive NTS serogroups. We have already developed live oral and conjugate vaccines against Group B {Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium) and D (S. Enteritidis) serovars that can protect against invasive NTS disease with the wild-type homologous pathogen. Although less common than strains of Salmonella Groups B and D, Group C organisms represent a significant proportion of NTS cases, and some Group C serovars (e.g. S. Choleraesuis) are highly invasive. The purpose of this translational research proposal is to develop Salmonella Group C live attenuated and conjugate vaccines. Our central hypothesis is that appropriately engineered attenuated strains of Salmonella enterica Group Cl and C2 serovars can: 1) allow safe, high yield preparation of core-0 polysaccharide (COPS) and flagella protein for making conjugate vaccines, and 2) serve as protective live attenuated vaccines. We will select suitable Salmonella Group Cl and C2 strains and genetically engineer them so that they are attenuated and secrete large amounts of Phase 1 flagellin protein into the supernatant. We will purify COPS and flagellin from these strains and construct COPS-FliC conjugate vaccines using various chemical strategies. These conjugates will be evaluated in adult and aged mice. Live attenuated Salmonella Group Cl and C2 vaccine strains will also be evaluated for their ability to protect adult and aged mice. We will also determine whether gnotobiotic piglets can be protected from invasive disease by S. Choleraesuis conjugate and live oral vaccines. We will ascertain whether NTS vaccines can also protect against gastroenteritis by testing our live attenuated S. Typhimurium vaccine CVD 1931 in the rhesus macaque model of Salmonella gastroenteritis. Finally, we will determine whether a multivalent formulation of live oral or conjugate Group B, C and D Salmonella vaccines can prevent invasive disease caused by Group B, C and D serovars. If we are successful, these results will pave the way for initiating future Phase 1 clinical trials and we will have addressed three ofthe four broad objectives of this multi-center research proposal."
"9412434","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current treatments for breast cancer focus on the killing malignant cells but there is a substantial population of patients for whom these approaches ultimately fail. The long-term objective of this work is to develop an adjuvant therapy that targets the tumor-promoting stroma of cancer as a way to potentiate current approaches. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are activated in the tumor microenvironment and facilitate disease progression by promoting angiogenesis and tumor cell growth, and by suppressing the adaptive immune response. We have recently identified a peptide that preferentially recognizes murine tumor-associated macrophage but not resting macrophage, other leukocytes, or tumor cells. In this work, we will prepare multivalent targeting constructs to deliver pro-apoptotic agents to TAMs in a mouse model of mammary cancer. In addition, we will develop analogous targeting peptides for human TAMs. These technologies will be combined in a new construct for targeted ablation of human TAMs. Our goal is to move this technology toward clinical development and to provide an adjuvant treatment that is effective even for women with hormone-unresponsive or triple negative breast cancer."
"9528884","In patients with intractable Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), ventral striatum (VS) deep brain stimulation (DBS) effectively reduces symptom severity in about 60% of cases. However, there is room for improvement in both clinical benefits and reduction of DBS-induced behavioral side effects, especially hypomania. A critical factor may be failure to adaptively adjust DBS in response to phasic changes in negatively and positively valenced states (i.e., OCD-related distress and hypomania, respectively). New generation adaptive DBS (aDBS) systems can record, stimulate and use signals from the brain to make responsive adjustments to the patient's behavioral state. Specific Aim 1 is to train the device to accurately classify acute fluctuations in OCD- related distress and emergence of hypomania and distinguish these states from other affective states that do not require adjustments in stimulation. Specific Aim 2 is to develop adaptive control policies that can automatically adjust stimulation parameters to regulate these undesired states. It is hypothesized that exacerbations in OCD-related distress will require increased stimulation (higher amplitude or wider pulse width) whereas hypomania will respond to decreased stimulation. These aims will be executed using a two-phase Early Feasibility Study of aDBS in 10 adults with intractable OCD. Subjects will enter a 6-month trial of open- label bilateral aDBS followed by 2 months of adjunctive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Subsequently, they will enter a 4-week blinded discontinuation period to assess need for ongoing DBS. In Phase I, 5 subjects will have surgery as per procedures of the FDA Human Device Exemption (HDE) approval for VS DBS in OCD. Electrode implantation will be optimized and personalized using ?precision mapping? of each patient's anatomical connectivity from high-field tractography in native space. DBS programming sessions will also serve to train the algorithms to classify different valence states. For example, a symptom provocation paradigm will elicit different levels of manageable OCD-related distress. During this paradigm multiple streams of time- locked physiological and behavioral data will be captured to build a classifier: Local Field Potentials (LFPs) from the VS, Scalp EEG, and Automated Facial Affect Recognition (AFAR), which objectively measures emotional valence. We hypothesize that classifiers using combined LFP/EEG data will perform better than VS LFPs alone, but that direct cortical recordings will be needed for accurate classification and creation of a fully embedded, self-contained, aDBS system. In Phase II, 5 subjects will have VS DBS surgery along with bilateral subdural placement of electrocorticographic (ECoG) recording leads at a prefrontal target, informed by resting state functional MRI from Phase I and pre-operative scans. New classifiers will be built based on VS and ECoG LFPs and adaptive stimulation algorithms tested in the clinic before transfer to the ambulatory setting. Meeting all study milestones would result in a prototype ambulatory aDBS system that would manage fluctuations in OCD symptoms and device-related side effects automatically."
"9560481","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Despite the success of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) to diminish peripheral infection, HIV-1 can establish an infection in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in the development of cognitive, behavioral, and motor deficits associated with HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Once infected, the CNS acts as a viral reservoir that is difficult to treat and eradicate. Mononuclear phagocytes (MP, e.g., perivascular macrophages and microglia) are important reservoirs in the immune-privileged CNS. The proposed studies are designed to address the unique dynamics of HIV infection in CNS and explore novel therapeutic strategies that target MP, ensure viable delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to eliminate the HIV reservoir and reduce inflammation. HIV-induced activation and viral replication in MP are relevant targets that that are the focus of our ongoing novel approaches through multiple pharmacological agents. These approaches include design and development of: 1) MP-specific ribonucleoside chain terminators (rNCTs) and their phosphate prodrugs, and 2) NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitors that cross the BBB and target MP, and 3) JAK inhibitors that block/interrupt the activation state of MP and can reduce inflammation. Selected therapeutic agents will be analyzed for their in vitro antiviral potency, and to assess biochemistry, toxicology, and cellular pharmacology parameters. We have recently identified low or sub-nanomolar MP-specific HIV inhibitors with a high therapeutic index. These will be evaluated in vivo to assess CNS pharmacology and response (including behavior and pathology) to treatment using two distinct retrovirus CNS animal models we have previously established including SCID mouse model intracranially injected with HIV-1 infected MP, and macaque model infected with SIVmac239. Results from these studies will identify new adjunctive therapeutic strategies which together with current cART should provide improved targeted therapy to MP. The ultimate goal is to suppress virus and eliminate these HIV- 1 reservoirs in the CNS that should lead to improved treatments to reduce risk(s) of developing HAND."
"9448676","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this proposal is to develop a thorough understanding of the regulation of the two subtypes of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) in cell culture and murine models of pulmonary hypertension (PH). The long-term objectives are to delineate the function and mechanistic pathways regulated by each of the PDE3 subtypes, PDE3A and PDE3B that are implicated in PH pathobiology for the development of potential therapeutic targets. PH is a life-threatening disease characterized by vascular remodeling, smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, and endothelial cell dysfunction that results in decreased luminal diameter, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, increased right ventricular pressures, progressive right heart failure and premature death. PDE3 hydrolyzes cAMP and cGMP, which are critical second messengers that regulate signal transduction pathways resulting in vasodilation. PDE3A and PDE3B have differential expression and function; therefore, we postulate they have distinctive roles and mechanistic actions in the pulmonary vasculature. PDE3A is implicated to be the important isoform in VSMC proliferation, while PDE3B plays an important role in energy metabolism. Thus, we hypothesize that it is through these discrete pathways that alterations in PDE3 play a role in PH. Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a disease in which failure of the normal circulatory transition at birth results in high pulmonary vascular resistance, low pulmonary blood flow and abnormal gas exchange. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is the only FDA-approved pharmacologic pulmonary vasodilator to treat patients with PPHN. However, ~50% of infants with PPHN have a suboptimal response to iNO. The mechanisms for poor iNO response in these patients have yet to be elucidated. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that exposure of iNO to the vasculature promotes PDE3 expression and/or activity suggesting the possibility that PDE3 activity may be the reason for the poor response. Therefore, in this proposal, we aim to define the role of each PDE3 subtype in murine models of PH utilizing PDE3A knockout and PDE3B knockout mice, as well as interrogate the interactions between two critical pathways involved in the pathobiology of PH: the NO-cGMP and cAMP-PDE3 pathways ? both upon which primary therapeutic modalities for PH are based. Finally, we propose to perform a prospective, observational cohort study to evaluate whether any clinical, biochemical and/or genetic biomarkers can predict which patients with PPHN will be nonresponsive to iNO therapy. Identifying and understanding the factors associated with a poor response to iNO therapy in these patients could lead to improved and personalized clinical decision-making that results in better patient outcomes, the identification of potential novel targets for therapy, and lower healthcare costs. Through this proposal, we will ultimately gain a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of PH that will allow us to design rational therapy plans to treat the disease."
"9452121","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Developmental brain disorders (DBD) comprise an etiologically-heterogeneous, behaviorally-defined group of conditions affecting a significant percentage of U.S. children and adults. Shared genomic underpinnings now directly connect seemingly unrelated DBD, including autism (ASD), intellectual disability and schizophrenia. DBD have traditionally been studied using categorical criteria (e.g., ASD versus no ASD) that are no longer consistent with biological evidence. Here, we propose a genome-first approach to the study of DBD, examining normally distributed quantitative traits that extend into the general population. We will characterize differential patterns of functional and medical impact of DBD-related pathogenic loss of function (pLOF) variants in 100,000 patients from Geisinger Health System through the use of EHR data mining algorithms, with the following aims: 1) Use a cross-disorder, genomics-driven approach to create a comprehensive knowledge base of DBD genes and copy number variant (CNV) regions. We will expand the knowledge base for identifying DBD loci using existing tools from our previous work: 1) a dosage map of the human genome and 2) a loss of function, single gene prediction model based on literature annotation for six specific types of DBD. High-confidence DBD genes and CNV regions will be used in Aim 2 for genomic variant mining of whole exome sequencing (WES) data. 2) Conduct large-scale, population-based analyses to identify a cohort with DBD pLOF variants. We will use WES data, generated as part of another Geisinger study, to analyze the frequency of DBD pLOF variants in 100,000 patients representing an unselected cross-section of our patient population. Individuals with a DBD pLOF variant (n=4,000) and their family members will be phenotyped in Aims 3 & 4. 3) Characterize quantitative phenotypes in individuals with DBD pLOF variants and their families. Among patients with DBD pLOF, we will use linked EHR data to document clinical DBD diagnoses. We will administer in-person and online assessments to measure quantitative, heritable traits including cognitive performance, adaptive behavior, and social function. We will also assess these traits in first-degree relatives to examine the effect of family background on phenotypic variability. We will describe dimensional, quantitative neurodevelopmental profiles that capture the full phenotypic spectrum associated with specific pLOF variants. 4) Assess medical comorbidities and healthcare utilization among individuals with DBD pLOF variants. We will survey our EHR dataset to compare medical comorbidities and healthcare utilization between individuals with and without pLOF variants. We will examine a range of variables including DBD-related specialty visits and prescription use, hospitalizations and surgical procedures, hypothesizing that comorbidities and utilization will be significantly higher among people with pLOF variants, regardless of whether they have a known clinical DBD diagnosis. Characterization of differential patterns of clinical diagnosis, neurodevelopmental function, medical impact and healthcare utilization based on genomic variants will ultimately pave the way for targeted interventions for DBD."
"9428448","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While molecular machineries involved in membrane fusion/fission have been dissected, regulation of fusion/fission dynamics remains poorly understood. We uncovered ENV7 as a novel gene involved in vacuolar events and have established it as an ortholog of STK16-related kinases. We have shown that Env7 protein is a palmitoylated vacuolar membrane kinase that negatively regulates vacuolar membrane fusion during budding and hyperosmotic stress. Additionally, we have established that Env7 phosphorylation in vivo is dependent on YCK3, a gene encoding another vacuole membrane kinase with a non-redundant function in fusion regulation. Deletion of both genes results in severe morphological defects and compromised growth. Thus, Env7-mediated membrane flux regulation appears to be part of a novel kinase cascade affecting global cell fitness. Based on our findings to date, we propose a model for regulation of Env7 function and hypothesize that 1) Env7-mediated vacuole fusion/fission is regulated through its phosphorylation by Yck3 and 2) Env7 substrate(s) include component(s) of the vacuolar fusion/fission machinery. Here, we propose to test various aspects of the proposed model through a systematic multifaceted approach that includes live cell imaging, biochemical analyses, in vivo and in vitro fusion assays, and global proteomic studies. If successful, this project will establish Env7 as a node in a novel kinase signaling cascade involved in regulation of membrane fusion/fission dynamics. This will be a leap forward in organelle biogenesis, membrane dynamics, and signaling. The proposed experiments also represent the first studies on regulation and cellular substrates of any STK16-related kinase. Inherent in this SCORE proposal, is the aim to develop the depth and research productivity of the PI within the highly active fields of membrane fusion and kinase cascades, while continuing the productive research training of undergraduate and Master's students within a comprehensive Hispanic Serving Institute. Lysosomal defects have been associated with Lysosomal Storage Diseases and neurodegeneration. Defects specifically in lysosomal fusion dynamics have recently emerged as the possible underlying mechanism in pathologies associated with both Lysosomal Storage Diseases and Alzheimer's disease."
"9410501","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 8 million bone fractures occur annually and 10% of these are delayed and nonunion fractures which fail to heal despite therapeutic intervention. Current therapeutic strategies are severely hindered by the limited supplies of autograft bone and the poor mechanical properties of artificial materials. Zebrafish are masters of regeneration, and I have found that adult zebrafish can rapidly regenerate up to half of its lower jawbone after resection. Craniofacial bone development is highly conserved between zebrafish and humans, and hence understanding large-scale bone regeneration in zebrafish may lead to novel treatments in patients. A unique feature of zebrafish jawbone regeneration is the involvement of an unusual bone-producing chondrocyte population. In this application, I aim to identify the progenitor population that generates these ossifying chondrocytes during large-scale bone regeneration, as well as the role of macrophages in stimulating this progenitor population. Utilizing Cre-based transgenic lineage tracing strategies, I will test that a Runx2+/Sp7- population of pre-osteolasts in the periosteum generate the cartilage callus during regeneration. Using a genetic ablation strategy, I will then test that macrophages are required for the earliest events in bone repair, namely the shift of periosteal cells from making bone during homeostasis to making cartilage during repair. Lastly, I propose to utilize a RUNX2:GFP transgene to isolate these periosteal cells for deep sequencing of expressed mRNAs, which will help identify macrophage-dependent genes activated in periosteal cells after injury. Together, positive findings will illuminate the role of the immune system in shifting the fate of periosteal cells from bone to cartilage during bone repair, with knowledge gained in the zebrafish model being used in the future to develop new bone repair strategies in patients."

Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA1) is a pro-inflammatory G protein coupled receptor, which induces pro- inflammatory cytokine release through G?-mediated signaling and interaction with endotoxin receptor, CD14. LPA1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung inflammatory disorders. Knockdown or inhibition of LPA1 attenuates endotoxin- or bleomycin-induced lung injury and sepsis. We discovered that LPA1 stability is regulated in the ubiquitin-lysosome system. Ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11) deubiquitinates and stabilizes LPA1, thus promoting LPA1-modulated pro-inflammatory effects. Knockdown of USP11 reduces LPA1 stability and attenuates both LPA- and LPS-induced lung inflammation. This is the first to demonstrate that destabilizing LPA1 reduces lung inflammation, and deubiquitinating enzyme contributes to the pathogenesis of lung injury. We have developed a small blocking peptide (LDPep) to interrupt the interaction between LPA1 and USP11, which specifically reduces LPA1 protein level, without altering expression of other LPA receptors and USP11 target proteins. LDPep post-treatment lessens endotoxin-induced lung injury and sepsis shock. This project will explore a novel therapeutic approach for treating inflammatory disorders like ALI and sepsis. Execution of these studies will lay the groundwork for a significant mechanistic advance in the molecular regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during severe infection. Results from these studies can serve as the basis for further development of pharmacologic agents that destabilize LPA1, thereby reducing severity of inflammatory diseases such as lung injury and sepsis."
"9664236","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current knowledge of the economic burden of MDs is limited by the methodologies used to estimate cost. We will use longitudinal, population-based surveillance data collected by the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet) to identify and estimate costs of procedures for patients with confirmed MDs and well-characterized natural histories. The MD STARnet was established in 2002 to conduct population-based surveillance and long-term follow-up of cases with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DBMD); longitudinal surveillance for DBMD has been ongoing since 2004. In 2011, the MD STARnet was expanded to include cross-sectional surveillance for seven additional MDs (congenital, distal, Emery-Dreifuss, facioscapulohumeral, limb-girdle, myotonic, and oculopharyngeal); surveillance of these MDs will be expanded to conduct longitudinal surveillance. We will evaluate the economic burden of these MDs from longitudinal surveillance of health care services received, private and public claims databases, and a self-report Health Care Services Cost-of-Illness survey. We have successfully integrated clinical, programmatic, and referral resources provided by key partners in Iowa, such as the Iowa Neuromuscular Program, with the active, population-based resources of the Iowa Registry for Congenital and Inherited Disorders to conduct longitudinal surveillance of DBMD and cross-sectional surveillance for the additional MDs. Also, our partnerships with the Reproductive Molecular Epidemiology Research and Education Program and the Center for Public Health Statistics at The University of Iowa will provide experienced investigators to conduct data analyses and publish cost-of-illness data. To accomplish our study objectives, we aim to: 1) conduct cost-of- illness analyses for DBMD and other selected MDs; 2) develop and implement a Health Care Services Cost-of-Illness survey for selected MDs; 3) estimate cost of compliance with care considerations for selected MDs; and 4) disseminate research findings to stakeholders and the scientific community. The availability of population-based cost estimates of treatments recommended in the care of MDs will be a useful resource for financial planning by health care practitioners and families at the time of diagnosis and as disease progresses."
"9394011","The University of Michigan?s Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity (MoTrPAC) Chemical Analysis Site (MiCAS) is designed to provide large-scale, high-quality metabolomics analysis in collaboration with the MoTrPAC consortium. The effort will be carried out using state-of-the-art metabolomics infrastructure by a team of chemists, spectroscopists, computer scientists and statisticians in the Michigan Metabolomics and Obesity Center (MMOC), the umbrella administrative structure for several NIH-funded initiatives. MiCAS will be led by investigators with extensive knowledge of exercise science and metabolomics and with experience collaborating with scientists from around the country, obtained in part through leadership roles in NIH-funded projects. The analytical platforms within MiCAS provide the ability to perform a wide variety of targeted, untargeted and flux analysis of metabolites in diverse systems from cells to humans. Core investigators have developed and published novel techniques and technologies to perform metabolomics profiling and to integrate these approaches with clinical studies and other molecular phenotyping methods to improve understanding of the biology of exercise and its relationship to metabolic health. MiCAS will contain 3 cores which will expand on the existing administrative and technical expertise. The Administrative Core will oversee the operations of MiCAS, including efficient utilization of the MMOC infrastructure, manage the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) and ensure adherence to Core and MoTrPAc-mandated SOP. The Administrative Core will be in charge of the scientific and administrative interactions with the NIH and MoTrPAc consortium, especially the other Chemical Analysis Sites. The Analysis Core will work across the MoTrPAc consortium to carry out analysis of the wide variety of samples that will be generated in the projects, to develop new technologies as needed and to provide assistance and input regarding the analytical workflows adopted by the consortium. The Bioinformatics Core will provide data management including data cleaning, data reduction, quality control for accuracy and reproducibility, missing feature identification and integration, normalization and interpolation under agreed-upon guidelines. The Core will provide initial statistical analysis of the data and help provide MoTrPAc and associated investigators with expertise and tools for integration of the data with data derived from the other MoTrPAc sites, including data generated across multiple ?omics platforms. Finally, the Bioinformatics Core will ensure timely transfer of accurate and verified data to designated repositories."
"9435160","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a devastating and common neurodevelopmental disorder and a major public health concern. Fragile X syndrome is the leading known genetic cause of autism, and both fragile X syndrome and the FMR1 premutation are highly associated with autism with ~70% and ~20% meeting DSM- criteria respectively. This proposal extends our initial study, Emergence and Stability of Autism in Fragile X, focused on behavioral symptoms and biomarkers of ASD risk in infants with fragile X syndrome and fragile X premutation at 6,9,12 and 24 months contrasted to siblings of children with idiopathic ASD and typical controls. This proposal represents longitudinal surveillance at 3, 4 and 5 years-of-age in our cohort of 158 infant participants. Our initial findings have fueled a new set of questions to enhance our knowledge of the emergence of ASD features, diagnoses and associated features in FXS and FXpm, including the prevalence and stability of ASD diagnoses FXpm, the stability of ASD core features focused across a continuum, the association of atypical attention and social fear as additive or independent associated features and the predictive value of infant-derived prodromal features to ASD diagnoses across preschool."
