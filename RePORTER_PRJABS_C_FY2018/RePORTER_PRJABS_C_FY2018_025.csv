"9554150","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The recent HIV outbreak linked to the injection of prescription opioids in Scott County, Indiana highlighted the vulnerability of rural communities to the introduction and rapid transmission of HIV and viral Hepatitis among persons who inject drugs (PWID). In the wake of this epidemic, jurisdictions across the United States have renewed efforts to address the syndemic of opioid injection and HIV infection, including by implementing syringe services programs (SSPs). SSPs are associated with decreases in incidence rates of HIV and viral Hepatitis among PWID. Modeling studies have shown that SSP implementation is cost-effective, resulting in millions in healthcare cost savings from averted HIV infections. Although the public health benefits of SSPs are well documented, most studies that examined their utility were conducted in major urban areas; a scarcity of literature exists regarding rural SSP implementation. This is a critical gap in the literature given that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified 220 predominantly rural counties across 26 states that are vulnerable to an opioid injection-related HIV outbreak. The purpose of this research is to address this gap in our understanding of rural SSPs through the following specific aims: (1) to determine what individual-level (e.g., gender, injection drug of choice) and community-level characteristics (e.g., unemployment and arrest rates) are associated with HIV prevention services utilization (e.g., SSP engagement, HIV testing) among SSP users (n=330) and nonusers (n=330) in two rural Appalachian counties vulnerable to HIV outbreak; (2) to explore barriers and facilitators (e.g., community response, policy environment) of SSP implementation in two rural Appalachian counties vulnerable to HIV outbreak with and without SSPs among 40 stakeholders; (3) to conduct cost analyses of SSP implementation in two rural Appalachian counties vulnerable to HIV outbreak. Aim 1 will allow us to better understand the individual and community characteristics associated with HIV prevention services utilization among rural PWID. These data will inform the development of future interventions that aim to reduce HIV risk behaviors among rural PWID. Through semi-structured key informant interviews (Aim 2), we will be able to compare the barriers and facilitators of SSP implementation in rural counties with and without SSPs. The results of Aim 3 will shed insights on rural SSP implementation costs and how service delivery may be impacted by changes in funding levels. This research project will be embedded in a comprehensive training program consisting of coursework, seminars, guided study, and mentorship by an established team of experts. The training program is designed to further my strengths and to develop new research skills while contributing to our scientific understanding of rural SSPs. The training proposal details a five-year plan of formal and informal instruction in: multilevel modeling, implementation science, and cost analyses. My short-term career goals include: completing coursework in all training areas, disseminating study findings through publications and presentations, engaging in career development activities, and applying for independent R01 funding in the latter years of the award. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in drug dependence and HIV prevention in rural areas."
"9468059","Project Summary  Precise specification of tissues and organs within the developing embryo requires the translation of cell position into cell fate. Both positional and functional information is provided by gradients of signaling molecules called morphogens, which specify several cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner. The Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) act as a morphogen to pattern the dorsoventral (DV) axis in all vertebrates. In zebrafish, a gradient of BMP signaling activity across the embryo is formed during gastrulation, where the highest level of BMP signaling is found ventrally and the lowest levels dorsally. BMP signaling specifies multiple ventral cell fates, whereas dorsal tissue specification requires suppression of BMP signaling. Proper positioning of gene expression is essential during development because these domains specify the relative abundance of distinct tissue types. However, it is unknown how cells along the DV axis interpret and translate distinct levels of BMP signaling into differential gene activation to specify cell fate.  Morphogen gradients have been shown to induce differential gene activation by multiple distinct mechanisms, including the steady-state amount of signaling, distinct temporal signaling duration, and the steepness of the graded signal across cells. I will test the hypothesis that distinct threshold levels of BMP signaling activity establish discrete gene expression domains. Using a quantitative immunofluorescence assay of nuclear phosphorylated Smad5, the transcriptional effector of BMP signaling, the Mullins lab has determined the shape of the BMP signaling gradient within the zebrafish gastrula. I will identify the ventral genes that directly respond to BMP signaling and the threshold level of BMP activity required to induce their expression within their endogenous domain. I will test the ability of the threshold level of BMP signaling activity to position target gene expression within a distinct domain.  BMPs are a member of the TGF- ? signaling family, which signal through highly conserved Smad transcription factors. Association of Smads with additional sequence specific transcription factors increases affinity and selectivity for specific target genes in response to different signals. Discovery of additional Smad5- cofactor interactions is critical for understanding BMP induced transcriptional regulation and cell fate specification. I will identify the DNA-binding cofactors that direct the specificity of nuclear pSmad5 to target genes essential for patterning the DV axis of the zebrafish embryo. I will identify Smad5-cofactor interactions through screening and analysis of transcription cofactor motifs captured by pSmad5 chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing. I will test if identified cofactors are required for BMP-dependent expression patterns and cell fate specification by using CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out cofactor expression. Together, these experiments will elucidate the mechanism for interpreting the BMP activity gradient into distinct expression domains and cell fates."

"9501065","PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance are associated with increased risk and worse outcomes for endometrial cancer (EC). Metformin is a biguanide that is widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological and pre- clinical data suggest that metformin may have anti-tumorigenic activity, due to its indirect effects within the metabolic milieu (?insulin, ?glucose) and direct effects on tumor cells through AMPK activation/mTOR inhibition and suppression of fatty acid/lipid biosynthesis. Metformin is dependent on cation-selective transporters for entry into cells, and the multi-drug and toxin extrusion transporters, MATE1 and 2, are expressed in human EC cell lines and tumors. Thus, metformin may break the link between obesity and EC, emerging as a metabolically targeted agent for this disease.  Within The Cancer Genome Atlas database, endometrioid ECs arising in obese versus non-obese women have distinguishing patterns of gene expression, including upregulation of lipoprotein lipase and modulators of the insulin/insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway. These findings suggest that ECs arising in obesity may have distinct metabolic vulnerabilities that could be targeted for treatment. In a phase 0 clinical trial of obese EC patients, short-term metformin treatment reduced proliferation and decreased expression of the IGF-1 receptor and targets of the mTOR pathway within the endometrial tumor tissues. Responders to metformin had higher pre-treatment levels of fatty acids/glycolipids in their serum and MATE2 in their ECs, suggesting that these biomarkers might predict metformin response. Lastly, in the LKB1fl/flp53fl/fl EC mouse model, diet-induced obesity led to a doubling of tumor size, accompanied by increases in energy metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. Importantly, metformin had increased efficacy against EC in obese versus lean mice and reversed the detrimental metabolic effects of obesity in the ECs, via shunting fatty acids to beta-oxidation as opposed to lipid production.  The overall goal of this proposal is to assess the contribution of indirect effects (via downregulation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling) and direct effects (via transporter-dependent cell entry, activation of AMPK/inhibition of mTOR signaling, blunting of fatty acid/lipid biosynthesis) of metformin (+/- chemotherapy) to its overall anti-cancer efficacy in (i) a clinically relevant EC mouse (obese/lean) model and (ii) an ongoing randomized phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating metformin versus placebo, in combination with standard of care paclitaxel/carboplatin for the treatment of EC [through the NRG Oncology Group]. Our central hypothesis is that predictors of metformin response (+/- chemotherapy) will include both molecular and metabolic biomarkers, specifically obesity, insulin resistance, upregulation of insulin/IGF- 1 signaling, heightened fatty acid/lipid biosynthesis and higher MATE 1/2 expression. The proposed research will rigorously test this hypothesis in parallel pre-clinical and clinical studies and support it with diverse measurements of metabolic and molecular markers associated with obesity and modulated by metformin treatment. This strategy should delineate the interplay of metformin?s indirect and direct effects on tumor growth, identify metabolic and molecular biomarkers predictive of response to metformin, and define the role of this agent in obesity-driven EC treatment."
"9589463","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can in?uence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded con?icting results in which some children bene?t but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities?that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply?is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ?lls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identi?es the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modi?ers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modi?ers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signi?cant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention."
"9490427","ABSTRACT Many vital cellular processes such as neuronal communication, insulin secretion and immune responses rely upon highly regulated fusion events between cargo containing vesicles and target membranes. All these processes require the assembly between vesicular (v-) SNARE and target (t-) SNARE proteins into a single SNARE complex, which brings the bilayers into close proximity and triggers their fusion. Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family proteins and calcium sensor bind to and modulate the function of specific sets of SNARE proteins in different cell types in many different ways not yet well understood. The goal of this project is to shed light into the mechanisms by which SM proteins and calcium sensors control granule exocytosis by focusing on the exocytosis of lytic granules (LGs) in cytotoxic t-cells as a model system. Insights into the molecular machinery that drives LG exocytosis emerged from genetic analyses of Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) patients in which LG exocytosis is impaired. With this completely novel approach we will exploit the slower kinetics, well-defined steps during LG exocytosis, and the higher energetic barrier imposed by the atypical lipid-anchored SNARE (STX11) involved in this fusion event, to dissect how SM proteins and calcium sensors control SNARE machinery during exocytosis. Using an in vitro ?flipped? cell-cell fusion assay developed in our lab, we found that lipid-anchored STX11 mainly supports hemifusion. Strikingly, addition of Munc18-2 ?a SM isoform of immune cells- promotes the transition from hemifusion to complete fusion suggesting that SM proteins has a direct role on membrane merging. We hypothesize that physiologically lipid- anchored STX11 mediates incomplete merging of LGs with the PM and requires an extra set of regulatory proteins ? Munc18-2 and calcium sensors ? for fusion pore opening and content release. To address these questions we will test: 1)- whether interactions of Munc18-2 with STX11 alone or with SNARE complexes stabilize and/or facilitate SNARE complex formation and drive membrane fusion. This will be done through a detailed protein:protein interaction analyses, functional ?flipped? cell-cell fusion assays, and optical tweezers to assess the strength of forces on single SNAREs complex; 2)- how Munc18-2 controls STX11-mediated LG granule fusion at physiologically relevant immunological synapses of cultured cells and whether Munc13-4 and/or Synaptotagmin-7 confer calcium sensitivity to this process. To do this we will use TIRF-microsocpy in genetically-modified human CTLs, cell lines or FHL patient-derived cells that either lack these proteins or express functional mutant constructs. Answering these specific questions will provide insights into what SM functions are universal from those that dictate cell-type specific differences, how lipid-anchored SNAREs mediate fusion in general, how cells control a potentially dangerous exocytic event and may guide approaches to intervene in LG secretion for therapeutic gain. Moreover, while exploiting a genetic disease to dissect a basic biological process, our proposal will shed light into how defects in exocytosis contribute to diseases."
"9527475","Project Summary This revised K01 application is designed to obtain support and time for Dr. Eric Thrailkill (PI) to gain training in translational substance abuse research and experience in conducting human behavioral pharmacology studies with adult daily smokers. This will accomplish the career development goal of expanding the PI?s skills and expertise to include laboratory research with human participants and with human behavioral pharmacology. In this project, the PI will complete an intensive training program in human behavioral pharmacology, translational science, and advanced statistical approaches to data analysis at the University of Vermont under the mentorship of Dr. Stephen Higgins. Dr. Higgins is internationally recognized for his human behavioral pharmacology work with smokers, clinical research on behavior change, and for his mentorship skills. The PI will become skilled in the technical and practical approaches needed to conduct human drug self- administration research with cigarette smokers. The training plan involves development of research and analysis skills in human behavioral pharmacology that will uniquely complement the PI?s background in preclinical research into the basic mechanisms of behavior change and relapse. The PI will maintain a focus on basic learning processes by continuing a training relationship with Dr. Mark Bouton, who has pioneered the study of fundamental behavior change mechanisms in preclinical models. The PI has a unique opportunity to combine the strengths of each mentor into a series of focused studies with adult daily cigarette smokers that will provide the basis for an R01 research project on behavior change mechanisms in smokers. He will apply his newly-developed expertise in human behavioral pharmacology and his background in preclinical relapse models to develop three laboratory models of behavior change and relapse processes at the human level. Each study will use an established, well-validated preparation where individuals under brief smoking abstinence come into a controlled laboratory setting to perform an operant task where they earn brief opportunities to smoke. This method will be used to study underlying processes involved in the reduction and relapse of smoking-reinforced behavior. Studies will examine (1) renewal of an extinguished cigarette-seeking response when the extinction context is changed, (2) resurgence of an extinguished cigarette-seeking response when extinction is introduced for a replacement behavior, and (3) relapse of a nonextinguished -- though suppressed-- cigarette-seeking operant response upon the removal of incentives for a replacement behavior. In addition to providing initial demonstrations of these relapse phenomena with operant responding in human smokers, each study will experimentally evaluate a learning-theory based approach to reducing relapse by enhancing the similarity of the relapse test context and the treatment context. Completing the training and research aims will provide the PI with unique expertise and extensive training in preparation for a career as a leading independent investigator on why treatments work and why individuals relapse."

"9506158","Project Summary A novel paradigm in paracrine signaling has recently emerged based on the findings identifying extracellular vesicles (EVs) as intercellular conveyors of biological information both in normal and pathological conditions such as cancer. EVs and their cargo have been shown by us and others to regulate gene expression and alter cell function in various cell types. Moreover, during pathological conditions such as cancer, the number and compositions of EVs alter the host immune response as well as synchronize the behavior of secondary tumors. Isolation and molecular profiling of EVs (i.e. RNAs, proteins, post-translational modifications, lipids, metabolites) both in health and disease are critical for understanding EVs' biogenesis and effector functions. Currently, the study of EVs as biological entities relevant for intracellular signaling and disease diagnosis is based on the assumption that the biogenesis and removal of EVs happen at a steady state rate, being modified mostly by the healthy/diseased status of the host. Our published results show that that is not the case. Our data indicate that the tissue-origin, number, size distribution, as well as protein, lipid, metabolite and RNA composition of EVs isolated by standard techniques depend not just on the blood collection methods, but also on the time of the day the blood samples were collected. Therefore, systematic assessment of these factors and other sources of variability in EV profiles are important for enabling basic biology, clinical and personalized medicine applications. Although it is beyond the purpose of this grant, the long-term goal of our team is to establish reproducible methods for blood collection and sample processing that would allow us to identify the specific molecular EV signatures during the day/night cycle, with the aim of pinpointing the ideal, organ-specific times for blood collection, which would increase the reliability and specificity of early cancer detection. We believe that establishing biological and methodological baselines are absolutely vital for correctly comparing proteomics and glycomics data obtained in various studies, as well as interpreting the data obtained from patients' samples."
"9664048","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis affects 10 million Americans, and associated fragility fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality. While a great deal is known about the molecular pathways controlling osteoblast and osteoclast function, relatively little is known about the most abundant cell type in bone, the osteocyte. Osteocytes produce sclerostin, a potent inhibitor of bone formation by osteoblasts and an osteoporosis drug target. Notably, the only existing osteoporosis therapy that boosts bone formation, parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1-34 (teriparatide), works in part by reducing sclerostin production by osteocytes. The focus of this grant proposal is to elucidate the intracellular mechanisms controlling osteocyte biology, with an emphasis on sclerostin gene regulation and its control by PTH. Class IIa HDACs (Hdac5 and Hdac4) have been identified as important regulators of osteocytic sclerostin production and osteocyte differentiation in general. Aim 1 will fully characterize the effects of class IIa HDAC deficiency on osteocyte biology in vivo using multiple independent and complementary approaches. Aim 2 will interrogate the role of class IIa HDACs in PTH-mediated sclerostin suppression in vivo. Importantly, though some information is known about how class IIa HDACs might control sclerostin expression, much remains unknown. Therefore, Aim 3 will determine novel class IIa HDAC binding proteins and substrates in osteocytes using cutting-edge proteomic approaches. The candidate Dr. Wein is a physician/scientist dedicated to a career in basic investigation in skeletal biology. His education (combined MD/PhD degrees) provides him rigorous training in basic science and human physiology. An endocrinologist subspecializing in metabolic bone diseases, considerable and complementary overlap exists between his clinical and research interests. Beyond the research proposed within, Dr. Wein's career development plan will allow him to maximize the resources within the MGH Endocrine Unit, Harvard Medical School, and the Broad Institute to achieve his career goals. He has identified a mentor, Dr. Henry Kronenberg, who is a worldwide leader in skeletal biology and PTH actions. Dr. Wein and Kronenberg have a plan for frequent meetings to discuss data and career development. Dr. Kronenberg has clearly identified aspects of the research proposed by Dr. Wein which will form the basis of his independent career. Collaborators within the MGH Endocrine Unit and at the Broad institute have been identified, and an advisory committee has been formed to evaluate progress and plan future directions. Dr. Wein will frequently present his data and attend seminars and journal clubs in the MGH Endocrine Division and at the Broad Institute, and will present his findings at international meetings on an annual basis. Formal coursework is planned in grant writing, public speaking, and computational biology to further enhance his probability of success as an independent physician/scientist. Dr. Wein's immediate career goals include acquiring the skills described in this grant proposal in conjunction with his mentor Dr. Kronenberg and collaborators identified within, and publishing first authors manuscripts in order to gain name recognition and to establish himself in the osteocyte field. Dr. Wein's long-term career goal is to establish himself as an independent investigator studying basic cell biology mechanisms controlling bone cell function in vivo. His PhD work with Dr. Laurie Glimcher focused on osteoblast biology, but at this point he needs additional training in skeletal biology and studying osteocytes in vivo and in vitro. Substantial expertise in these areas is present within MGH Endocrine Unit, a collaborative group dedicated to mineral ion metabolism and bone biology, with close attention to relevance to the understanding and treatment of human disease. Aims 1 and 2 of this grant proposal will allow Dr. Wein to gain experience and expertise in the in vivo approaches required to study osteocyte biology. Aim 3 will facilitate the discovery of new genes important for osteocyte function: as an independent investigator, Dr. Wein will then use the skills acquired in this grant proposal to determine the phenotype of novel mutant strains."
"9572773","We are requesting funds to purchase a Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer to replace a similar instrument that is more than 10 years old. In addition, the manufacturer Agilent Technologies has upgraded the model we are currently using and will no longer support the older instruments after 2018. The Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer has become a staple of laboratories doing mitochondrial biology. It uses solid-state disposable optical sensors to simultaneously measure mitochondrial respiration (oxidative phosphorylation) via the oxygen consumption rate, and glycolysis via the extracellular acidification rate in cell cultures, tissues and isolated mitochondria, allowing investigators to profile cellular metabolic function. Methods are also available for quantifying endogenous and exogenous fatty acid oxidation, substrate oxidation, and metabolic phenotype. The Agilent Seahorse XF technology has been used with a variety of cell lines, including primary cells, adherent and suspension cell lines, isolated mitochondria, islets, 3D spheroids, Zebrafish embryos, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, yeast, and other biological materials. Importantly, this is a non-invasive methodology and cells can be used post-measurement for other applications or chronic (long-term) experiments. A key advantage of the Seahorse XFe24 is that it allows measurement of mitochondrial function in intact cells or tissue samples avoiding the requirement for isolation of mitochondria and potential artifacts that can occur during tissue disruption and organelle fractionation. Dr. Van Remmen has extensive experience with this instrument and currently assists other investigators at the VA and the OMRF and OUHSC campuses in data collection using the Seahorse Analyzer through her role as Leader of the Integrative Redox Biology Core of the Oklahoma Nathan Shock Center. The charges from users of the Shock Center Core can be used to support service contract and maintenance costs. The Seahorse XFe24 will be a valuable tool for our VA investigators. It will be utilized by eight VA investigators: five with funded VA Merit grants and three potential users who have VA Merit grants pending."

There are no controlled, randomized, blinded clinical trials to compare the efficacy and tolerability of currently available treatments of ESE. This and the accompanying Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) application describe the ESE treatment trial (ESETT), which is designed to determine the most effective and/or the least effective treatment of ESE among patients older than two years by comparing three arms: fosphenytoin (FOS), levetiracetam (LEV), and valproic acid (VPA). This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Bayesian adaptive, Phase III comparative effectiveness trial. Up to 795 patients will be randomized initially 1:1:1 and response-adaptive randomization will occur after 300 patients have been recruited. Randomization will be stratified by three age groups, 2-18, 19-65, and 66 years and older. The primary outcome measure is cessation of clinical seizure activity and improving mental status, without serious adverse effects or further intervention at 60 min after administration of study drug. Each subject will be followed until discharge or 30 days from enrollment. This trial will include interim analyses for early success and futility. This trial wil be considered a success if the probability that a treatment is the most effective is greater than 0.975 or the probability that a treatment is the least effective is greater than 0.975 for any treatment. This will be the first phase III clinical trial of ESE in children and adults."

"9432552","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goals of this project are to develop an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that control the function of K2P potassium channels and to identify, develop, and characterize small molecule, ion channel modulators for the K2P family. K2Ps are a diverse family of potassium-selective channels that are responsible for background 'leak' currents. These currents are pivotal in modulating the excitability of neurons. K2Ps respond to varied stimuli that include pH changes, temperature, and mechanical force. Although K2Ps have well-established roles in the nervous and cardiovascular systems and are implicated in pain, anesthetic responses, thermosensation, and mood, they are the least well-understood potassium channel class. Ion channels are coveted drug targets. As membrane proteins, they are readily accessible to extracellular compounds and their modulation brings about rapid changes in the properties of excitable cells in the heart and brain. However, as membrane proteins, they also reside beyond many of the well-established approaches for modulator development that require purified material. Consequently, many channels, including those in the K2P family, lack significant pharmacologies. This problem leads to a gap in our ability to connect ion channel genes with in vivo function. We are pursuing a multidisciplinary approach that includes biophysical, structural, and electrophysiological measurements and genetic selections to identify, dissect, and characterize the core elements that control K2P function and to define and characterize new small molecules that control K2P activity. Defining the molecular mechanisms that control K2p activity and uncovering new K2P modulators should provide the key framework and necessary tools for understanding how K2Ps function. Because of their important roles in human physiology, K2Ps are targets for drugs for the treatment of chronic pain, stroke, and depression. Thus, developing an understanding of how K2Ps function and means to find and small molecules that affect channel function should not only provide powerful tools for dissecting K2P mechanism but should aid in the development of new therapeutic agents for a range of human diseases."
"9493628","Abstract  Funding is requested for the purchase of three essential items that will be used to upgrade a 900 MHz NMR spectrometer: (1) a 900 MHz Bruker NEO spectrometer console, (2) an 15N-direct detection probe to harness the 15N TROSY effect and (3) a magic angle spinning (MAS) probe with a 0.7 mm stator rotor system.  The 900 MHz NMR spectrometer was delivered in September, 2005 and is now out of date in many respects. Thus, the new console will offer the following innovations: (1) an increase in sensitivity of 20-30 % mostly for samples for samples that are concentration limited, facilitating experiments at low receiver gain, facilitating experiments in H2O. (2) improved radio frequency spectral purity on both the transmit and receive channels, critical for the band selective TOCSY experiments ; (3) hardware that is compatible with the latest versions of Topspin-4, the Bruker spectrometer operating system; (4) the software has much improved compatibility with non-uniform sampling (NUS) algorithms; (5) transceiver hardware allowing multi-receive features so that it is possible to sample 13C and 15N signals simultaneously; (6) finally, because of the age of our current console, within a year or so we will not be able to purchase spare electronics boards to replace on the current console when they fail.  The 15N-detect TROSY probe will be used in exciting new experiments that yield high-resolution spectra of large proteins. The 0.7 mm MAS probe will permit sample spinning at 111 kHz and therefore enabling performance of high-resolution 1H detection MAS experiments on many different biological systems. The new instrumentation will be used in investigations of membrane proteins, amyloid fibrils, large macromolecular complexes, plant cell walls and many other exciting biological problems.  The upgraded 900 MHz instrument will be part of a cluster of instrumentation that serves a community of scientist performing high field biological NMR in the Boston area and North America."
"9456449","PROJECT ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability throughout the world, and prevalence of OA increases with age. With an aging population, the socioeconomic burden associated with OA is expected to increase over the coming years. The hallmark of this disease is a slow, progressive cartilage erosion driven in part by inflammation from an activated synovium (the tissue that surrounds the joint). Chondrocytes (the cells in cartilage) lose their capacity to maintain a healthy tissue as they become diseased. Macrophages (activated cells in the synovium) contribute to the chondrocyte phenotype shift and subsequent cartilage degradation through the secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules. Currently, there are no effective disease modifying treatments to intervene in this degradative cascade. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a disease modifying intra- articular (IA) injection treatment which targets diseased chondrocytes and macrophages with one simple approach ? by shifting the cell membrane potential (Vmem) to a more positive (depolarized) state. Vmem depolarization can be achieved with a variety of methods, the easiest of which is through simply increasing the extracellular potassium concentration. However, in order to implement depolarization strategies into a disease modifying IA injection, we first need to demonstrate a proof-of-concept (i.e. that we can return activated, diseased cells to an unactivated state via depolarization) and determine the length, intensity, duration, and specificity of Vmem depolarization treatments. As such, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Aim 1: Establish the ability of Vmem depolarization to transition activated, cartilage explants and pro- inflammatory macrophages to a more normal, unactivated phenotype. Aim 2: Determine the length, intensity, duration, and specificity of Vmem depolarization treatments appropriate to IA injection approaches."

"9467568","ABSTRACT  22q11Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) patients have feeding and swallowing difficulties that compromise their  nutritional status and increase nasal, middle ear, and respiratory infections due to aspiration and reflux. The  causes of these clinically significant difficulties are unknown. Using the genetically accurate LgDel mouse  model of 22q11DS, which has similar phenotypic features, we found that retinoic acid-mediated anterior-  posterior patterning of the hindbrain is altered, and that several of the cranial nerves that control feeding and  swallowing have aberrant growth patterns early in development. These observations suggest that aberrant  development of the hindbrain motor and/or sensory neurons leads to dysfunction of the network of cranial  neurons that are needed to execute feeding and swallowing. We will test the hypothesis that diminished  22q11 gene dosage disrupts anterior-posterior (A-P) hindbrain patterning via retinoic acid (RA)  signaling, and thereby re-specifies brainstem and/or neural crest precursor cells, leading to dysphagia.  Our experiments in Specific Aim 1 will quantify RA production to assess excess ligand availability, measure  hindbrain RA responses to evaluate enhanced RA sensitivity, and determine changes of additional patterning  centers and their targets in LgDel embryos where anterior CNs are compromised, Tbx1+/- where they are  spared, and LgDel:Raldh2+/- where they are rescued. To identify genes that, if mutated, predispose at-risk  fetuses to dysphagia, in Specific Aim 2 we will compare transcriptomes from the hindbrains of WT embryos,  LgDel embryos in which RA signaling is enhanced, and LgDel:Raldh2+/- embryos in which it is returned to WT  levels. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will characterize position, molecular identity, frequency, proliferative,  and/or migratory capacities of anterior versus posterior hindbrain motor neuron, interneuron, pre-migratory and  migratory neural crest precursors in LgDel embryos in which anterior CNs are compromised, Tbx1+/- in which  they are spared, and LgDel:Raldh2+/- in which they are rescued. The results of PROJECT 2 will establish the  developmental origins of pediatric dysphagia pathology defined by PROJECT 1, and determine how these  mechanisms contribute to specific aspects of disrupted feeding and swallowing. Our data will define new  molecular pathways for fetal and early postnatal diagnosis, and targeted therapeutic interventions.  Experiments in PROJECT 3 will evaluate the precision of these targets for correcting key aspects of dysphagia  pathology in fetuses at risk for perinatal feeding and swallowing difficulties."
"9443642","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in identifying defective genes underlying neuropathologies, how these defects underlie symptoms is not known, and this gap is a formidable stumbling block for therapeutics. A case in point is Rett Syndrome (RTT), a severe neurological disease in girls. The disease is due to sporadic mutations in the transcription factor, MeCP2, but why loss of MeCP2 causes neuropathology is enigmatic. Further, RTT holds a unique place in neurological disease because key symptoms are reversible in mice by expressing MeCP2 throughout the brain or just in astrocytes, the prominent glial cell type in brain. The rescue opens the door to therapeutic approaches, but requires a better understanding of what is deficient in RTT and precisely what is rescued upon MeCP2 restoration. Traditional approaches, such as microarray analysis, have focused almost exclusively on individual gene transcript changes, primarily in neurons. This approach has not led to clear answers about the functions of MeCP2 or the cellular basis of the disease, in part due to cellular heterogeneity. It also ignores work indicating a role for astrocytes in contributin to symptoms. In no case is there a molecular benchmark for extent of rescue. Our goal is to attack these issues head on by focusing specifically on rescue of RTT symptoms by astrocytes. Here, we perform a co-expression network analysis, using RNA seq combined with membrane proteomics, on brain and on pure populations of cells sorted from murine brain (aim 1). With an eye towards human-specific therapies, we identify the molecular and cellular consequences of loss and gain of MeCP2 in neural cells from RTT patient IPSCs, and test predictions from these studies in human/mouse xenografts (aim 2). Finally, we test a new hypothesis (aim 3), based on recent preliminary results, that reduced excitatory signaling between astrocytes and neurons may be a functional outcome of the alterations in molecular and membrane properties of these cells (aims 1 and 2)."
"9575402","Four VA funded investigators at the North Florida South/Georgia Veterans Health System at Gainesville Malcom Randall VA Medical Center (VAMC) are requesting a laser point scanning Confocal Microscope (LSM) with Airyscan made by Carl Zeiss to replace a 15-year old inoperable and outdated Confocal Microscope. This old system has been a part of the Research Service Core Equipment for this VAMC. This obsolete and non- functioning 2-photon system is too old to renew/salvage a service contact, and currently the manufacturer is unable to provide the assistance it needed to make it operational. It was a very useful system over many years for many investigators performing basic and translational research in this VAMC. Now it is not operational. Therefore, it has been a cherished desire of all investigators of this VAMC to replace this old system with a new Multi-Photon Confocal Microscope. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to obtain necessary funds to purchase a state-of-the-art Multi-photon confocal microscope system and to replace this old 2-photon system. The request includes all the necessary components of a new microscope system that can function as a complete system. Several factors make this ShEEP proposal very significant which include a) an existing dedicated location to house this microscope (no renovation or room modification is needed), b) an existing proven functional operating plan for day-to-day management and safe operation, c) a team of experienced users, and d) committed financial resources from the Research Service to maintain the service plan during post-warranty period. The proposed LSM 880 Multi-photon Confocal Microscope with Airyscan is a cutting-edge/ultramodern LSM system made by Carl Zeiss, Germany. The manufacturer graciously agreed to trade in our dilapidated old system with a significant $$ amount (see quote). This microscope provides extremely sensitive imaging and are particularly well suited to our VA researchers here in this VAMC. This system has the capability of generating 34-channel parallel imaging across the complete wavelength to monitor up to 10 dyes simultaneously to produce a beautiful image of a target tissue sample. The NLO multiphoton microscopy add-on for LSM 880 combines laser scanning functionality with Airyscan and an outstanding imaging depth by nonlinear Carl Zeiss optics to make this microscope a superior system. Since this proposed system is a part of Research Core facility, it will benefit all investigators of this VAMC. The participating VA investigators for this ShEEP request have VA appointments (minimum 5/8th) with VA space/resources at the Malcom Randall VAMC, and have joint appointment with the University of Florida as faculty member in the College of Medicine. All investigators are successful, productive and funded. Each investigator is experienced in attracting and training high caliber VA career development, predoctoral and postdoctoral level trainees, as well as mentoring the research careers of many young investigators. Each of the VA investigators is extensively accomplished in both academia and research. The dual affiliations provide an optimal setting with broad academic resources for education, research training, and research collaborations for each of the investigators individually and collectively. Although the needs for a modern confocal microscopic imaging system are always there, both individual investigators and the Research Service lack the ability to purchase such an innovative microscope system. This confocal microscope offers several advantages over conventional light optical microscopy and other modest confocal microscopy, including the ability to control depth of field, elimination or reduction of background information away from the focal plane and the capability to collect serial optical sections with three dimensional imaging from thick specimens. There has been a tremendous explosion in the popularity of confocal microscopy in recent years, due in part to its great number of applications in many areas of current research interest. This system will provide a progressive new dimension to this Research Service. Availability of this advanced/contemporary microscope, indeed, will facilitate research effort, collaboration and expand the research portfolio of this VAMC."

"9416611","Project Summary/Abstract: Spartan Protease Repairs DNA-Protein Cross-Links (DPCs) and Prevents DPC-Induced Oncogensis Patients with bi-allelic mutations in Spartan, termed Ruijs-Aalfs (RJALS) syndrome, are prone to early-onset hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and segmental progeria. Spartan was initially characterized for its role in promoting cell survival upon UV-damage. Recently, the metalloprotease activity of the SprT domain of Spartan has been shown to cleave DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs). DPCs are toxic lesions that stall replication forks during DNA replication. Unrepaired forks lead to DNA breaks and fork collapse, leading to genome instability, cell death or senescence. DPC repair has been shown to be mediated by specific enzymes such as tyrosyl- DNA phosphodiesterase, nucleases and/or the coordinated action of nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination DNA repair pathways in some cases. However, the precise mechanism underlying DPC repair is largely unclear. This proposed study is designed to evaluate the molecular mechanism by which Spartan mediates the removal of DPCs at stalled replication forks. We will investigate the effect of RJALS patient mutations on the tumor suppressor functions of Spartan in hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo and target Spartan and Spartan-mediated DPC repair as cancer therapeutics. Investigating the functions of Spartan in DPC repair will not only advance our understanding of the mechanism of RJALF syndrome, but will also help evaluate the potential of sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapy by targeting Spartan protease and Spartan mediated DPC repair pathway."
"9441838","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is responsible for over a million hospital admissions annually in the US, and is the leading discharge diagnosis for patients over 65. Nearly half of the people admitted for HF have HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). HFpEF is associated with reduced quality of life and reduced survival, equal to that of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Unfortunately, there are no known pharmacologic therapies that consistently improve either the morbidity or mortality associated with HFpEF. Several large trials of neurohormonal antagonists, agents known to improve survival in HFrEF, failed to establish benefit in HFpEF, suggesting that the mechanisms at play in HFpEF may be inadequately explained by those implicated in HFrEF. An early paradigm of HFpEF pathophysiology was that a stiff left ventricle leads to elevated filling pressures during exercise, resulting in shortness of breath. However, it is now recognized that HFpEF is a much more complex syndrome with important contributions from the periphery-including the skeletal muscle and the microvasculature. The broad working hypothesis of this proposal is that abnormalities in the skeletal muscle and the microvasculature play important roles in the exercise limitation seen in heart failure, in general, and in HFpEF specifically. This proposal seeks to demonstrate the relationships between exercise and (1) skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and (2) the diffusion capacity of oxygen to move from the capillary to the mitochondria. In Aim 1, skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity will be determined non-invasively using MRI and near-infrared spectroscopy techniques, while Aim 2 will investigate diffusion capacity through maximal limb exercise with concurrent sampling of venous blood and measurements of arterial inflow. We hypothesize that patients with HFpEF will have greater impairments in mitochondrial function and diffusion capacity than patients with HFrEF or hypertensive controls. In Aim 3, we will randomize patients with HFpEF to inorganic nitrate, an agent known to improve exercise capacity and with the potential to affect both skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and diffusion capacity, to determine the relative contributions of these peripheral mechanisms to exercise capacity in HFpEF. Demonstration of an important role of these peripheral factors would open new avenues of investigation into ways to improve exercise capacity in HFpEF. Dr. Zamani is a heart failure and transplant cardiologist with experience in patient-oriented research in HFpEF. His long-term goal is to become a leader in the peripheral manifestations of heart failure and identify how abnormalities in the periphery impact exercise capacity. His patient-oriented career development training plan includes mentoring by experts in heart failure, exercise physiology, mitochondrial function, nitric oxide biology, and arterial hemodynamics. His proposed studies leverage the facilities and expertise available to him at the University of Pennsylvania, with important collaborations with outside faculty members."
"9510886","Liquid biopsy is emerging as a powerful, cost effective tool for genotyping cancer cells, individualizing therapy to match the growing arsenal of drugs with cancer genetics, and monitoring genetic shifts in cancer cells in nearly real time. Liquid biopsy has the potential of significantly improving therapy outcomes while reducing cost. The detection of cancer-related mutant DNA in body fluids, such as blood and urine, often requires a ?needle in a haystack? approach. Excess wild-type (WT) DNA exhausts essential reagents during polymerase amplification, introduces false positives, and masks mutation alleles? signals. Common strategies to enrich very low abundance aberrant nucleic acids include selective digestion of WT DNA with guided cleaving enzymes such as CRISPR Cas9 and/or peptide nucleic acid (PNA) polymerase amplification clamping technique that suppresses WT DNA amplification. Although these strategies have been successful in some cases, they suffer from a number of shortcomings and often require multiple, time-consuming unit operations that increase contamination risk. To augment and overcome the limitations of available enrichment tools, we propose a new enrichment method that utilizes the DNA-guided, argonaute protein cleaving enzyme isolated from Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo). TtAgo is highly specific, efficient, and versatile. Unlike CRISPR cas9, TtAgo does not require presence of any specific sequences such as the PAM motif (that is essential for CRISPR Cas9) to enable cleaving. TtAgo is amenable to multiplexing and operates at > 65oC, which minimizes non specific hybridization of DNA guides and makes TtAgo ideal for integration with various isothermal amplification schemes. At the conclusion of this project, we will have developed a TtAgo-based multiplexed assay for rare alleles? enrichment that would greatly enhance the sensitivity of downstream mutant allele detection schemes such as NGS and ddPCR with and without multiplexed pre-amplification. The method developed here is also useful to enhance detection of other rare mutant alleles such as associated with fetal abnormalities."
"9664023","INHIBITORS OF CELLULAR TRANSPORTERS FOR THE TREATMENT OF TNBC Abstract Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is defined by the receptor status of the cells. TNBC does not express estrogen, progesterone, or Her-2 receptors. It is estimated that 1 million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. TNBC is the most deadly sub-type of breast cancer, accounting for ~15% of the breast cancer diagnoses and ~25% of breast cancer-related deaths. Median survival for 30% of the patients with TNBC is 1 year. TNBC arises more frequently in women younger than 60 years of age, particularly of African-American descent, and those who possess the BRAC1 mutation. Seventy-five percent (75%) of women, who have breast cancer with the BRAC1 mutation, will develop TNBC. TNBC has poor clinical outcomes because it is highly metastatic, resistant to chemotherapy, and lacks effective treatment options. Nirogyone?s approach is to develop small molecule MCT1/MCT4 dual inhibitors to shunt glycolysis, block metabolic symbiosis, prevent metastasis, and effectively treat TNBC. A novel lead molecule (NGT- 008) has already been synthesized, and evaluated in in vitro and in vivo pilot experiments. Preliminary data demonstrates that NGT-008 exhibits good potency against a TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, good physicochemical properties, reasonable mouse pharmacokinetic profile, and modest in vivo efficacy. NGT-008 showed no cytotoxicity even at 10µM against several normal cell lines including muscle cells which are known to express MCTs. In this application, we propose to further characterize NGT-008 and its optimized analogs by conducting the following AIMS: (1) Develop analogs of NGT-008 with improved pharmacokinetic profile and potency by iterative synthesis and homology models of MCT1 and MCT4 to aid in the discovery of new improved lead compounds to increase in vivo efficacy (2) Extend in vitro cytotoxicity studies to other TNBC cell lines (3) Evaluate the in-vivo efficacy of the optimized analog in a mouse xenograft model of MDA-MB-231 while establishing a 3D co-culture system. The proposed work will determine the feasibility of NGT-008 or its optimized analog as a novel therapeutic agent to treat TNBC. Next steps will be to evaluate an optimized analog in additional in-vivo studies (orthotopic models, PDX models, dose response, dosing regimen, toxicology assessment, etc.) as determined by results from AIMS 1, 2, and 3 in order to nominate a pre-clinical candidate. This will be a part of Phase II application."
"9617552","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R21/R33 project uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of ondansetron on neural functioning and sensory symptoms in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders (TD). Despite extensive research, 30-60% of OCD patients do not respond adequately to first-line treatments, with similarly disappointing rates in TD. OCD and TD present a treatment challenge in part because they are heterogeneous disorders characterized by clusters of symptoms likely derived from differing neural etiologies. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach seeks to address this problem by investigating transdiagnostic components of behavior that more closely align with brain circuitry. This application focuses on sensory phenomena (SP) - uncomfortable or aversive sensations preceding compulsions in OCD and tics in TD - as a critical component of both disorders with a discrete neural circuitry centered on sensory regions in the insula and somatosensory cortex. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist acting on sensory pathways, is a promising novel candidate for the modulation of neural circuits related to sensory phenomena. Ondansetron reduces sensory symptoms in non-psychiatric conditions and has been shown to decrease overall symptom severity in both OCD and TD. Our pilot data show that single 16 mg doses decrease activation of the insula and somatosensory cortex, raising the possibility that ondansetron may reduce disorder severity by directly targeting sensory circuits. Building on these promising findings, this application uses a double blind, placebo-controlled, mixed design to investigate the effects of three different doses of ondansetron on the activation of neural targets in the insula and somatosensory cortex. Milestone- driven assessment at the end of the R21 phase will provide clear support for a go/no-go decision regarding the engagement of neural targets by the drug. If target engagement is established, the R33 phase will seek to validate these neural targets in a patient sample and test the relationship between target activation and clinical symptoms. Using a double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design, we will measure the effects of 4 weeks of optimal dose ondansetron (determined from the R21 phase) on brain functioning and sensory phenomena in a sample of OCD and TD patients. Results from the R33 phase are expected to provide support for a second go/no-go decision regarding further clinical development of the targets and intervention. Regardless of outcomes in either phase, results from this project will increase knowledge about mechanisms of disease as well as the intervention."
"9530371","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spina Bifida clinic standards are not well described or standardized. While multi-disciplinary clinics are considered the standard of care for children with Spina Bifida, evidence to support this model in adults is lacking. Good, seamless health care delivery is important for people with Spina Bifida; however, current systems of care designed to meet the needs of children with Spina Bifida end when a child becomes an adult. Finding good care for adults with Spina Bifida is difficult because of the number of specialists needed, the limited number of practitioners serving this growing population, systems of care that is unprepared to deal with their needs, their growing chronic adult needs, and the lack of knowledge about them. This group is facing a precarious future unless a collaborative approach is initiated to identify their needs and create a health care system that offers uniform, adequate multi-disciplinary care. The creation of the Clinical Care Monitoring and Tracking (CCMT) infrastructure is about looking for problems and needs and about assessing and harnessing the strengths and resources that promote better health and well-being in the Spina Bifida community. Research efforts into the Spina Bifida clinic network resulted in a National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NSBPR), the compilation of the clinics list, a clinic classification schem, and the creation of the World Congress on Spina Bifida Care and Research. The Spina Bifida Association (SBA) is currently leading the Spina Bifida Collaborative Care Network (SBCCN) in developing a strategic plan to close the health care gaps that have been outlined. The goals of the SBCCN are to identify the needs of people living with Spina Bifida, develop and implement approaches to connect and communicate with adults living with Spina Bifida, address health care needs as well as gaps in care, improve the availability of information on health and community resources, identify and promote research priorities for the NSBPR, develop a quality-based Spina Bifida clinical structure using the (2008) classification scheme, describe and disseminate the list of Spina Bifida care sites that meet the quality-based clinical structure, and develop, implement, and disseminate a comprehensive evaluation plan that measures the effectiveness of the activities of this funding announcement. Expected Outcomes are creation of a public health infrastructure that monitors, tracks, and evaluates Spina Bifida care across the lifespan, development of health outcomes for people with Spina Bifida, and the improvement of a high performing Spina Bifida clinic structure."

"9540443","Project Summary My long-term career goal is to become an independent translational neuroscientist with expertise in dementia associated with neurodegenerative disease. This proposal is the first step in attaining this goal by combining a comprehensive training plan with an innovative program of research to investigate early anatomic markers and genetic risk factors for the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to include frontotemporal degeneration (ALS-FTD). An estimated 50% of ALS patients develop impairments in executive function, personal and social behavior, and receptive and expressive language indicative of frontal and temporal lobe neurodegeneration, and 10% of these individuals develop dementing impairments consistent with ALS-FTD. ALS is a fatal neuromuscular disease, and ALS-FTD is consistently associated with significantly reduced time of survival. End-stages of ALS implicate eventual frontal and temporal lobe disease, and causal pathogenic mutations linking ALS and FTD have been identified; however, early indicators of ALS-FTD in patients with sporadic (i.e. non-mutation) forms of disease are lacking. To identify early markers and risk factors for the progression of ALS to ALS-FTD, I employ a series of advanced bioinformatics analyses of multimodal neuroimaging, clinical, and genetic data from a large, well-characterized ALS patient cohort. I propose two Aims: Aim 1) Identify early anatomic markers for progression from ALS to ALS-FTD by relating early, whole- brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) to decline on targeted assessments of cognition and behavior, and Aim 2) Evaluate genetic risk factors for ALS-FTD in patients with sporadic disease by investigating the neuroanatomic and neuropsychological profiles associated with risk alleles at 18 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with ALS and FTD. I hypothesize that early frontal and temporal neurodegeneration will serve as a sensitive in vivo marker for the progression from ALS to ALS-FTD, and further hypothesize that this will by modified by SNPs that selectively confer risk for frontal and temporal lobe neurodegeneration. My proposed research is innovative in several ways: 1) I focus on the identification of early in vivo markers and risk factors for ALS-FTD, 2) I study patients with sporadic forms of disease, which accounts for 90-95% of ALS, 3) I investigate complex, multivariate relationships between regional neurodegeneration, genotype, and clinical symptoms in a comprehensive, network-based approach to the study of dementia, and 4) I take a unique clinical neuroscience approach by recruiting patients from specialized ALS and cognitive neurology clinics to minimize attainment bias. The knowledge gained from this project can be used to define patient endophenotypes, design and stratify clinical trials, and identify therapeutic targets, and also can be used in clinical settings to contribute to early identification, prognostication, and targeted treatment. Furthermore, project outcomes will increase our growing understanding of how dementia evolves in Alzheimer's Disease and related neurodegenerative diseases."
"9432524","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rising incidence of obesity is a huge health concern in the United States, is associated with a number of related health problems including diabetes and heart disease and is an enormous economic burden through associated healthcare costs. Obesity is a multifactorial disease, and environmental factors play a large role in motivating of feeding behavior. Although it is known that environmental cues can potentiate feeding through Pavlovian mechanisms, the neural circuitry underlying this phenomenon has not yet been systematically analyzed. This proposal seeks to identify this neural circuitry using a conditioned cue- induced feeding (CIF) task. The first specific aim is to characterize the brain regions involved during cue- induced feeding using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and immediate early gene (IEG) mapping. The second specific aim is to identify the genetic identity of activated neurons and to optogenetically and chemogenetically silence and/or activate those neurons. The research described here will shed light on the neural circuitry underlying feeding behaviors that lead to obesity and may provide entry points for potential therapeutics."
"9668980","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spina Bifida clinic standards are not well described or standardized. While multi-disciplinary clinics are considered the standard of care for children with Spina Bifida, evidence to support this model in adults is lacking. Good, seamless health care delivery is important for people with Spina Bifida; however, current systems of care designed to meet the needs of children with Spina Bifida end when a child becomes an adult. Finding good care for adults with Spina Bifida is difficult because of the number of specialists needed, the limited number of practitioners serving this growing population, systems of care that is unprepared to deal with their needs, their growing chronic adult needs, and the lack of knowledge about them. This group is facing a precarious future unless a collaborative approach is initiated to identify their needs and create a health care system that offers uniform, adequate multi-disciplinary care. The creation of the Clinical Care Monitoring and Tracking (CCMT) infrastructure is about looking for problems and needs and about assessing and harnessing the strengths and resources that promote better health and well-being in the Spina Bifida community. Research efforts into the Spina Bifida clinic network resulted in a National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NSBPR), the compilation of the clinics list, a clinic classification schem, and the creation of the World Congress on Spina Bifida Care and Research. The Spina Bifida Association (SBA) is currently leading the Spina Bifida Collaborative Care Network (SBCCN) in developing a strategic plan to close the health care gaps that have been outlined. The goals of the SBCCN are to identify the needs of people living with Spina Bifida, develop and implement approaches to connect and communicate with adults living with Spina Bifida, address health care needs as well as gaps in care, improve the availability of information on health and community resources, identify and promote research priorities for the NSBPR, develop a quality-based Spina Bifida clinical structure using the (2008) classification scheme, describe and disseminate the list of Spina Bifida care sites that meet the quality-based clinical structure, and develop, implement, and disseminate a comprehensive evaluation plan that measures the effectiveness of the activities of this funding announcement. Expected Outcomes are creation of a public health infrastructure that monitors, tracks, and evaluates Spina Bifida care across the lifespan, development of health outcomes for people with Spina Bifida, and the improvement of a high performing Spina Bifida clinic structure."
"9537239","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States alone, seasonal (inter pandemic) influenza is responsible for more than 200,000 hospitalizations and more than 23,000 deaths per year. The primary strategy to attenuate the impact of influenza epidemics is vaccination. Currently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged 6 months or older. However, some of these recommendations have been questioned, and the paucity of vaccine effectiveness estimates based on laboratory confirmed influenza disease further fuels this controversy. Furthermore, because influenza viruses and vaccines change annually, and because recommendations for these vaccines now cover most of the US population, annual assessments of vaccine effectiveness are needed to assess whether influenza vaccination is having its intended effects. Vanderbilt investigators have conducted prospective population- based surveillance for laboratory confirmed influenza for both the NIH and the CDC. We propose to conduct prospective surveillance in Davidson County, TN, with the following specific aims: 1) To conduct active population-based surveillance in adults hospitalized for laboratory confirmed influenza, to determine age-specific rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations; and, 2) To determine influenza vaccine effectiveness annually, using a case-control study design, among influenza positive adults hospitalized for influenza and influenza negative hospitalized controls. Vanderbilt investigators are experienced in conducting active prospective population-based hospital surveillance of laboratory confirmed influenza infections and in assessments of the effectiveness of influenza vaccines."
"9440952","Project Summary/Abstract Dietary restriction (DR) extends life span and retards aging-associated pathology. Rapamycin likewise extends survival and reduces aging-related disease in mice, and extends lifespan in Drosophila. These manipulations share a common effector through the kinase Target of Rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). TORC1 impacts translation and autophagy, processes with potential to control aging. Intensive work currently focuses on how these TORC1-affiliated systems are required for rapamycin and DR to slow aging. Aside from its control of protein production, TORC1 impacts gene expression. Rapamycin induces hundreds of genes in mammals and Drosophila. How TORC1 directly affects transcription is largely unknown, but recent work in Drosophila reveals a novel mechanism: dTORC1 phosphorylates the transcriptional cofactor REPTOR (?Repressed by TOR?). REPTOR interacts with REPTOR-BP to control ~300 rapamycin/dTORC1-mediated genes. Furthermore, REPTOR and REPTOR-BP are regulated by dietary amino acids in Drosophila, and we find that their mammalian homologs (CREBRF and CREBL2) mediate glucose metabolism in mice. As an Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant (R21) this proposal intends to break new ground in understanding how DR and rapamycin function with TORC1 to control aging via REPTOR. Our preliminary results are positive: REPTOR is essential for DR to slow aging and in particular, DR requires REPTOR in neurons or gut cells to extend lifespan. REPTOR -- and perhaps by extension DR, TORC1 and rapamycin -- appears to slow aging through non-autonomous TORC1 mediated mechanisms. Here we aim to determine whether activated REPTOR is sufficient to slow aging in Drosophila, whether rapamycin requires REPTOR and REPTOR-BP to slow aging, and which cells require REPTOR and REPTOR-BP for DR to slow aging. These are early steps in a research program needed to set-up future work on the cellular mechanisms through which REPTOR controls aging."
"9547118","Summary  HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) and substance abuse comorbidity remain prevalent despite combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). A major challenge in the AIDS therapeutic development field is the identification of targetable mechanisms that underlie persistent neuronal dysfunction in HIV-infected individuals despite ART.  While internal RNA modifications have been known for decades, their roles in RNA metabolism and function are only beginning to be elucidated. In particular, dynamic RNA modifications are believed to represent a new layer of control of gene expression. The present proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that understanding the role of RNA modifications in the implementation of gene expression programs that are dysregulated by the interaction of HIV, cART and substance abuse in neurons, astrocytes and microglia, can indicate transformative new mechanistic hypotheses on neuroAIDS pathogenesis that will have the potential to lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets to improve neuropsychological functioning in people with HIV. The impact of RNA modifications on HIV transcripts and splicing and HIV protein levels in HIV Tg rats will also be investigated.  To test the present hypothesis we assembled a collaborative team involving expertise in behavioral and molecular neurobiology, gene expression and advanced systems biology methods to study transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms.  In particular, we will explore RNA modifications in well-established behavioral paradigms of moderate or compulsive (dependent) cocaine self-administration in HIV transgenic (Tg) rats in the setting of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We will use a systems biology approach in conjunction with RNA profiling in identified brain cell types to investigate the role of RNA modifications in neuronal injury and glia dysfunction in neuroAIDS. We will focus primarily on the most abundant mRNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and the proteins that compose its regulatory machinery. The effects of histories of cocaine intake and cART on m6A modification of HIV transcripts in HIV Tg rats will also be investigated. The mechanisms identified will also be investigated in follow-up studies in models of moderate and compulsive self-administration of other drugs of abuse as well as available human gene expression datasets.  Ultimately this proposal - at the interface of computational analysis of gene network regulation and advanced behavioral pharmacology - is aimed at identifying new testable mechanistic hypotheses that may lead to transformative new therapeutic concepts to improve neuropsychological functioning in people with HIV."
"9472051","Risk for Opioid Abuse and Misuse in Adolescence Abstract Current rates of prescription opioid misuse are rising to epidemic levels among adults. These rates may be even higher among adolescents, who have elevated levels of substance exploration and misuse during this precise developmental period. Adolescents who are exposed to opioids via legitimate prescriptions are at increased risk for misuse after high school. However, there is a substantial gap in our knowledge of what factors might contribute to the development of misuse and related poor outcomes in these high-risk youth. Identifying factors that convey risk for increasing opioid use and problematic use would inform adolescent models of opioid abuse and inform the development of preventive interventions to modify risk in the medical setting. The pediatric medical setting, where adolescents are exposed to opioids via legitimate prescription is a unique point of entry into opioid use, and a key setting in which to examine adolescent outcomes. The proposed study will utilize a developmental model of the impact of opioid exposure by legitimate prescription during late adolescence, with consideration for pain and psychological characteristics of the individual within the family and peer context. Predictors and mechanisms of increasing opioid use and problematic use will be examined over a 2 year time period during late adolescence. The central hypothesis is that adolescent pain characteristics will influence opioid use and problems over time, and that opioid availability will mediate this association. Pain medication specific parent factors will also be examined, including parental chronic pain and opioid prescriptions, attitudes about pain medications, and pain catastrophizing. Longitudinal models of opioid use and opioid problems will be tested in a sample of 14-18 year olds receiving opioid prescriptions for non- cancer pain in outpatient medical settings (n= 500 adolescents and a parent will be enrolled). These adolescents will be assessed every 6 months for 2 years, and will report on pain characteristics, opioid and other substance use and problems, peer factors, as well as pain catastrophizing and other pain-related psychological factors. Objective data on dispensed opioid medications will be obtained from prescription drug monitoring databases. Daily associations between adolescent pain, pain catastrophizing, and opioid use will also be examined. Determining mechanisms and moderators of risk during this developmental transition will provide critical information for the design of interventions aimed at reducing opioid use disorders in at-risk youth."
"9425237","PROJECT SUMMARY Mucociliary clearance is an essential function to prevent chronic airway disease. In the healthy lung, multiple motile cilia beat synchronously to transport inhaled particles and mucus out of the airways. Poor mucociliary clearance arises when motile cilia function is impaired, and is a fundamental feature of many inherited and acquired respiratory diseases, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), asthma, chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis (CF). Since motile cilia are complex and highly specialized organelles, a large spectrum of genes, many yet to be discovered, likely contribute to the various forms of PCD, where cilia may be absent, reduced in number, or missing key structures that enable an effective, coordinated power stroke. This wide breadth of pathologies makes diagnosis difficult, requiring highly specialized expertise for interpretation of electron micrographs and ciliary beat frequency, and treatment is mainly symptomatic. Understanding the complexity of ciliopathy-driven lung disease and development of targeted therapies for these disorders is hindered by a lack of reproducible patient-specific in vitro models to study molecular mechanisms that govern human multiciliated cell (MCC) specification and function. This experimental barrier is addressed in this application by exploiting our novel, in vitro human system to systematically identify causative mutations and signaling mechanisms underlying inherited and acquired forms of ciliary dysfunction. We are uniquely poised with our expertise in ciliogenesis, gene editing (CRISPR/Cas9) and human iPSC to complete the following specific aims: (Aim 1) Evaluate MCC differentiation from iPSCs and generate a complete human MCC transcriptome; (Aim 2) Evaluate and correct ciliary dysfunction in lung epithelial cells derived from DNAH5 mutant PCD patient iPSC; (Aim 3) Identify and evaluate novel defective cilia genotypes in PCD patients with no currently identified causative genetic mutation. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is to gain mechanistic understanding of human MCC specification and function using a robust in vitro model where a direct comparison between control and PCD patient cells will lead to a better understanding of the known human genes that lead to ciliary dysfunction. Moreover, this experimental approach will create a robust pipeline for identification of novel mutations causative of PCD, thus providing significant new insights into mechanisms underlying inherited and acquired diseases characterized by ciliary dysfunction. The proposed research is innovative as we will exploit our human iPSC approach to determine key regulators of MCC differentiation. Systematic comparison of human iPSC-derived MCC from PCD patients will lead to the functional validation of known and novel causative mutations while addressing a critical need of a reproducible and defined human model system in which to carry out these experiments. These studies should lead to the rapid progression of novel therapeutics and better diagnostic/genetic tests for PCD to the clinic."
"9442736","PROJECT SUMMARY Adolescence is a critical developmental period for tobacco initiation and progression to regular use and dependence. Comprehensive tobacco control policies that reduce the reinforcing effects of cigarettes in adolescents may decrease the number of cigarette experimenters who go on to become lifelong smokers. With the passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was granted the authority to establish standards for tobacco products as appropriate for the protection of public health, including the authority to mandate a reduction in the nicotine content of all cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. Numerous studies have found that adult smokers who are switched to very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes experience reductions in smoking rates, nicotine intake, nicotine dependence and abstinence-induced craving relative to those who use normal nicotine content (NNC) cigarettes. However, to date, studies of VLNC cigarettes have excluded adolescent smokers, and are critically needed to inform potential product standards. Furthermore, as use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has increased dramatically in adolescents, effects of VLNC cigarettes on smoking in youth must be examined in the context of e-cigarette availability. Project 3 is a 2 x 2 x 2 mixed-factors laboratory study in which a smoking choice procedure will be used to determine how the nicotine content of cigarettes and key characteristics of e- cigarettes (nicotine concentration and flavors) influence use of these products and their subjective effects in adolescents. In this single-site study, adolescents aged 15-19 (N=120), who are daily cigarette smokers and have used e-cigarettes on at least 5 occasions, will first complete a baseline session in which eligibility criteria are confirmed, background questionnaires are completed and participants gain experience with the e-cigarette device to be used in later sessions. Next, participants will complete 5 lab sessions in which NNC (15.8 mg/g) or VLNC (0.4 mg/g) cigarettes are available and e-cigarettes varying in nicotine concentration (2 mg/mL or 18 mg/mL) and flavor (tobacco or non-tobacco) are concurrently available. After sampling and rating the subjective effects of each product, participants will make a series of 10 choices between 2 puffs of either product or abstinence. An additional lab session during which e-cigarettes are not available will allow a direct comparison of the effects of NNC and VLNC cigarettes on smoking when no alternative product is available. We hypothesize that reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes will reduce cigarette choices and increase both e-cigarette choices and choices to abstain from either product. We further hypothesize that e-cigarettes with higher nicotine concentration and non-tobacco flavor will be most effective at reducing cigarette choices. We will also test the impact of these factors on the subjective effects of each product and explore whether the behavioral and subjective effects of each product vary as a function of age and gender. This project will provide the FDA with critically important information on how the nicotine content of combusted tobacco affects the reinforcing and subjective effects of cigarettes in adolescents, and how those effects are altered when e- cigarettes with different characteristics are available as alternatives."
"9516611","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in both men and women worldwide. Malfunction in lipoprotein metabolism and elevated levels of plasma cholesterol are known causes of CVD and about half of all Americans are likely to have at least one of these risk factors. Individual characteristics that present additional risk factors for CVD include, gender and other factors, which affect an individual?s internal hormonal milieu; age; diet; and genetic factors. Lipoprotein metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis are strongly regulated by low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and high- density lipoprotein receptor scavenger receptor type BI (SR-BI). Briefly, LDLR binds to plasma LDL and delivers LDL-cholesterol to peripheral tissues. In the liver, SR-BI, functions as a receptor for the cholesterol-rich HDL and serves to facilitate the selective delivery of HDL-cholesterol to the liver. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that SR-BI expression is induced, both in vitro and in vivo, by the ovarian hormone, 17?-estradiol (E2). We also show that the MLL-family of histone methylases coordinate with estrogen receptors (ER) to regulate E2-induced SR-BI expression. Moreover, knockdown of MLL2 decreases hepatic SR-BI expression and subsequently elevates plasma cholesterol level in male mice, while E2-treatment to ovariectomized (OVX) animals induces hepatic SR-BI expression. Here, we propose to further elucidate the detailed molecular/epigenetic mechanisms by which E2 regulates SR-B1 expression and resultant hepatic function in vitro and in vivo. Specifically we will study, roles of MLL2 and its histone methylation function in E2-induced SR-BI expression, using HepG2 cells overexpressing ER? or ER?, or in primary hepatocytes. In aim 2, we will investigate the function of MLL2 in cholesterol uptake and efflux in vitro. We will also study the roles of MLL2 in SR-BI expression, and consequent hepatic function, in female mice in vivo. The proposed studies will reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism of E2-induced SR-BI gene expression and cholesterol homeostasis and our results will help in identifying novel target for the treatment of CVD. In addition to addressing an important scientific problem, this proposal will also serve to enrich student research experiences at UTA ? a minority serving institution. The experiments outlined will provide students with meaningful and high quality training opportunities. The end result will ultimately enhance the research training environment at UTA, and increase the prospects for our students to pursue future careers in health-related fields. 1"
"9561712","Project Summary Women who inject drugs (WWIDs) are at significantly higher risk of contracting HIV due to both needle sharing and sexual behaviors, yet utilize HIV prevention resources less. Analysis of studies testing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has not tested effectiveness in WWIDs and little research exists on their specific barriers to uptake and adherence. The result is a significant group who is highly vulnerable to HIV infection and its negative health consequences, yet is less likely to benefit from PrEP. Research is needed to understand how WWIDs perceive HIV risk and PrEP, and whether a targeted intervention that is embedded in an existing and trusted syringe exchange program is feasible and holds promise in addressing structural barriers to accessing PrEP and increasing its use in this at-risk population. To address this gap we will conduct a rigorous formative evaluation utilizing a unique and innovative marketing evaluation technique. Using perceptual mapping and vector modeling analysis, we will develop 3-D maps to identify specific message strategies to embed into an intervention using targeted PrEP counseling, written materials, and text based messaging and pilot tested for promise of efficacy compared to a general PrEP intervention. The intervention will address psycho-social barriers to PrEP through perceptual mapping but also societal and structural barriers by embedding it in a trusted syringe exchange and distributing medication through its medical clinic. Specific aims of the research are: 1. Assess WWIDs' perceptions of PrEP and potential barriers to use. To accomplish this we will conduct focus groups (n=30) and interviews with syringe exchange staff (n=10) and develop a perceptual mapping survey. 2. Develop a targeted communication intervention based on vector modeling findings, including print materials, PrEP counseling, and text messages, and assess feasibility and acceptability. To accomplish this we will conduct perceptual mapping surveys with HIV- WWIDs (n=100), do vector modeling analysis and create sample messages, concept test messages with WWIDs and staff (n=20), create intervention materials and conduct usability testing (n=20). 3. Pilot test the intervention by integrating into a syringe exchange to assess promise of efficacy. To accomplish this we will conduct a randomized pilot (n=50) and test an ?enhanced? intervention using targeted messages with a ?basic? intervention that provides general PrEP counseling. To assess promise of efficacy we will compare PrEP adherence (blood test; self report) and differences in PrEP attitudes, self-efficacy, and decisional conflict. If successful, the proposed pilot study will significantly contribute to HIV prevention by examining the unique perceptions of PrEP in WWIDs and the acceptability, feasibility, and potential impact of using health communication strategies in adjunct with existing services in a social service agency. This pilot will provide crucial information for a subsequent RO1 proposal to rigorously evaluate an urgently needed HIV prevention intervention developed specifically to meet the unique cultural and social needs of high-risk WWIDs"

"9416998","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the established measurement of kidney function that is used to define the presence and severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The diverse physiological functions of the kidneys are unlikely to be captured by GFR alone. Proximal tubule secretion is an essential, kidney-specific mechanism for rapidly eliminating retained solutes and administered medications from the circulation. We developed and validated novel assays to measure endogenous markers that are primary cleared by proximal tubule secretion. We used these markers to demonstrate considerable individual-level variability in estimated tubule secretion function relative to GFR among CKD patients. This grant proposes two parallel aims to advance understanding of proximal tubule secretion function. First, we will estimate secretion function in the prospective Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study and determine associations with CKD complications and major clinical outcomes. Second, we will recruit a primary cohort of patients across a broad range of kidney function and compare estimated tubule secretion function versus GFR for predicting renal drug clearances. Potential applications of the proposed studies include earlier detection of CKD, improved monitoring of kidney disease patients, and optimized renal medication dosing strategies."
"9538877","Project Summary/Abstract In cerebrovascular disorders, such as Alzheimer?s Disease and stroke, the ability to maintain normal cerebral blood flow is compromised. Neurovascular coupling (NVC), the temporal relationship between neural activity and cerebral blood flow, is thought to be disrupted in these conditions resulting in cerebral hypoperfusion and cognitive dysfunction. As nitric oxide (NO) mediates vasodilation, the neurons that release (NO) are good candidates as a major regulator of cerebral blood flow (CBF). We recently developed a new genetic tool? NK1R-creER knockin mouse? that allows us to target and manipulate a specific subset of NO-generating neurons (nNOS Type 1 neurons), and thus test the involvement of these cells in neurovascular coupling for the first time. Here, we propose to test the specific hypothesis that nNOS Type 1 neurons receive excitatory pyramidal input and mediate vasodilation. Aim 1 will investigate whether NK1R-creER cortical interneurons receive excitatory pyramidal input using immunohistochemical approaches. Aim 2 will investigate whether pyramidal neurons form functional synapses onto NK1R-creER cortical interneurons using optogenetic approaches and slice electrophysiology. Lastly, Aim 3 will test whether NK1R-creER interneuron activity is necessary and sufficient to increase cerebral blood flow in vivo using laser Doppler flowmetry. Together, these experiments will investigate the circuits coupling neural activity and hemodynamics. This insight into NVC is fundamental to our understanding of the pathogenesis of common cerebrovascular diseases and the advancement of pharmacotherapeutics targeting cerebral perfusion."
"9539110","PROJECT SUMMARY ?The Auditory Systems? Gordon Research Conference (?Auditory GRC?) consisting of ~125-150 scientists with diverse expertise will convene on July 8-13, 2018 at Bryant University in Smithfield, Rhode Island, to discuss and debate new findings in hearing research and related fields. The Auditory GRC is preceded by a smaller Gordon Research Seminar (?Auditory GRS?, July 7-8) and will include talks and posters by 40-50 investigators- in-training, thereby serving as a gateway to the GRC. Together the Auditory GRC & GRS offer a unique combination of features, including: breadth of research, cutting-edge emphasis, mingling of investigators from all ranks and diverse sub-fields and locales, intimate size and extended discussion time, allowing for close and sustained interactions. Some of these features arise from unique qualities of the hearing research field and others from the Gordon Conferences' established nature and highly successful format. Since the 1920s, the GRC organization has supported meetings famous for their unfettered debate and discussion of emerging data.  The program for the 2018 Auditory GRC will emphasize the Function, Dysfunction and Restoration of the auditory system. As such, the conference will range from basic science discoveries on native mechanisms in developing and mature auditory systems, to pathological aspects of the auditory periphery and central pathways to the latest translational efforts to preserve and restore auditory function using, small molecules, gene therapy, cell and regenerative therapies, development and use of next generation prosthetic devices. Each session will include a mix of these three broad topics and will include an array of cutting-edge techniques from identification of novel signaling pathways to generation of inner organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells to advanced optogenetic stimulation of central auditory pathways.  Over the past ten years of hosting Auditory GRCs, we have learned from experience to design sessions that have something that will appeal to scientists with diverse backgrounds. As such, we will endeavor to highlight different model systems, from zebrafish to humans, and technologies from molecular & genetic to systems and behavior. Throughout the sessions we will include a broad mix of talks that focus on studies of central and peripheral auditory neuroscience and will include the broader thematic topics for the 2018 Auditory GRC. Our goal is to encourage unusually high attendance throughout the meeting and cross-fertilization across disciplines.  For the Auditory GRS, talks will be selected from submitted abstracts and anchored by a keynote address by an invited mentor-participant who is at the assistant professor level. In addition, mentoring is an active component of the GRS. The keynote speaker, as well as the GRC organizers, will be available for informal and formal discussions including a research funding session, featuring a representative from NIDCD, and a career session, featuring individuals working in diverse fields, such as academia, industry, publishing and policy."
"9454524","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oxytocin is known to regulate social behaviors, stress reactivity, mental health, cardiovascular and immune systems, in part through actions in the central and autonomic nervous systems. Preliminary studies have shown that exposure to exogenous synthetic oxytocin in early life can have long-lasting, epigenetic effects on behavior, neural systems and genes that are dependent on endogenous oxytocin. The proposed translational research will provide the first animal model specifically aimed at testing the behavioral, endocrine, autonomic and epigenetic consequences of exposure to oxytocin associated with the birth process. Although it is likely that many systems throughout the body are affected by oxytocin, we will focus initially on neural processes and genetic pathways known to be sensitive to endogenous oxytocin, including the expression of genes for oxytocin and the related peptide, arginine vasopressin (AVP), and selected receptors for each of these. Using a series of interrelated projects we will examine the consequences of (a) exposure during birth to synthetic oxytocin (Pitocin), commonly used to induce or augment later, and (b) blocking the oxytocin receptor by exposure to oxytocin antagonists (OTA), used to slow the birth process. The specific objectives of this proposal are: (1) to develop a translational animal paradigm designed to model and study selected features of human birth-interventions, (2) to test the hypothesis that the functional presence or absence of the neuropeptide, oxytocin associated with birth will influence the behavior and brain of the offspring, with effects on the oxytocin/AVP  pathway (including genes for the peptides and their receptors), (3) to gain a deeper knowledge of neural mechanisms which may be affected by birth-related interventions, and (4) to identify specific epigenetic consequences of oxytocin and other birth-related interventions. Both males and females will be tested, allowing us to examine the hypothesis that the effects of birth-related interventions may be sexually dimorphic. These studies also will test the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms, based initially on methylation of DNA for the oxytocin receptor {OXTR), allow the epigenome to be transformed by the birth experience. The newly developed paradigms described here can be used to discover the epigenetic consequences of birth interventions and improve methods for optimizing birth outcomes. Data from this study also will inform the present understanding of the normal developmental biology of social and emotional behaviors and will aid in the evaluation of the consequences for infants of treatments commonly used to manipulate the human birth process. These studies also will increase our basic understanding of neural, autonomic, endocrine and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie fundamental mammalian behaviors, including social behaviors, emotion regulation, and behaviors indicative of anxiety and depression. The animal model used here will be the prairie vole, which has a human-like autonomic nervous system, a social system characterized by high levels of sociality and all parental behavior, long- lasting pair bonds and high levels of oxytocin Measures to be taken in later life include indices of (a) social and emotional behaviors, (b) endocrine changes including measures of endogenous oxytocin and AVP and gene expression (mRNA) for their receptors using PCR, (c) autonomic nervous system function measured by radio telemetry and indexed by heart rate and rhythmic changes in heart rate mediated by vagal efferent pathways, (d) changes in neural activation and circuitry as measured by functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) in response to social cues, and (e) measures of epigenetic modifications of the offspring's genome, using a detailed analysis of CpG DNA methylation of genes in the oxytocin pathway, such as OXTR."
"9599902","PROJECT SUMMARY Loss of homeostatic capacity is a fundamental and defining property of aged organisms from yeast to humans. The global protein kinase-substrate network forms an essential backbone of the homeostatic signaling network (HSN) that allows cells to respond appropriately to a dynamic environment and cellular needs. We propose that aging can be modeled as a series of changes to the HSN that directly impinge on core cellular functions. The overarching goal of this proposal is to model the HSN in yeast, and to understand the mechanisms by which degradation of the HSN results in functional declines and increasing risk of mortality with age. To accomplish this goal we will use a combination of global and targeted mass spectrometry approaches to map at high resolution the kinases and substrates that comprise the HSN. We will then expose aging yeast to perturbations, and measure changes in signaling using phosphoproteomics. Finally, we will combine these population level analyses with single-cell microfluidics measurements in order to define the penetrance and temporal dynamics of key components of the network (kinases and substrates) and reporters of cellular functions that are most prone to degradation throughout aging. This approach will allow us to determine, for the first time, the extent to which individual cells experience distinct aging trajectories. We will use this information to develop models for network degradation with age and to predict key components of the network prone to failure, which could potentially be strengthened to build a more robust network. We will test these predicted improvements by engineering them within yeast strains and assessing whether the strains indeed maintain important network structures with age, keep cellular functions of their youthful state, and, perhaps, live longer."
"9424636","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from chronic autoimmune responses against pancreatic beta cells, leading to their virtually complete eradication and consequently loss of insulin secretion. There is an unmet need to discover novel biomarkers that better mark disease activity and beta cell destruction. Novel biomarkers could improve our ability to identify at-risk individuals before autoantibody conversion, for early intervention, and could help staging disease progression more precisely to facilitate risk stratification and better guide enrollment into trials. Our overall goal is to discover and validat circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) that can be exploited as novel biomarkers of islet autoimmunity. MiRNAs are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression in cells. MiRNAs regulate virtually all pathways, including those relevant to T1D, such as key functions of the immune system and pancreatic beta cells, their development and regeneration. MiRNAs are also present and remarkably stable in serum and plasma. Circulating miRNA biomarkers are reported in many conditions, both acute and chronic, but remain largely unexplored in T1D. This is a joint application from research groups at the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) in Detroit and the University of Miami (UM). Each group has independently discovered associations of selected miRNAs with T1D. Our preliminary data involve large and well-characterized clinical cohorts from the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet and the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1). Comparison of our data reveals that many of the miRNAs we independently found associated with islet autoimmunity and/or T1D were observed in both studies. This concordance provides compelling rationale to conduct further studies of circulating miRNAs in T1D, and gave us impetus to present this application, combining our complementary expertise and data, believing that this joint effort will be strongly synergistic and will powerfuly impact the discovery and validation of miRNA biomarkers for T1D. We propose the following aims: 1) Examine serum miRNAs as biomarkers of diabetes progression in two large data sets of progressors versus slow/non-progressors, both through cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses; 2) Examine the relationship of miRNA biomarkers to autoantibodies, in longitudinal studies of the TrialNet cohort, to determine if miRNAs identify a group or relatives destined to acquire autoantibodies and could serve as early biomarkers preceding autoantibody conversion; 3) Examine whether relatives with highly susceptible and protective HLA haplotypes have different patterns of circulating miRNAs, in relation to diabetes progression; 4) Construct composite predictive models incorporating multiple prognostic miRNAs and other biomarkers (genetic, immunological, metabolic) available from the parent studies. This multiple-PI proposal is led by experts in T1D, statistics, biomarker discovery and prediction studies in the DPT-1/TrialNet cohorts, biomarker data mining, and miRNA studies both at the preclinical and clinical levels."
"9526804","Project Summary/Abstract Candidate: The K01 candidate, Dr. Gloria Luong, has been an Assistant Professor in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at Colorado State University (CSU) since August 2015. Career Development Plan: Her previous training formed a strong foundation in emotion regulation, health, and aging topics, but the K01 mechanism would propel Dr. Luong to the next stage of her career and enable her to reach her long-term career goals of becoming an independent investigator. Dr. Luong's immediate career goal is to acquire mastery in cardiovascular stress physiology, as well as in advanced quantitative methods, which would allow her to model how multivariate stress processes predict health outcomes across adulthood. Envi- ronment: CSU provides an ideal environment for the training and research activities ? Dr. Luong has access to critical resources, lab space, equipment, collaborations, and home mentors (Drs. Manfred Diehl and Frank Dinenno) that will ensure the success of the career development program. In addition, because Pennsylvania State University (PSU) offers leading-edge training in advanced quantitative methods, Dr. Luong will learn these techniques from her off-site mentors, Drs. Nilam Ram and Sy-Miin Chow. Research: Dr. Luong's long- term research goals are to delineate the role of stressor characteristics (e.g., lab vs. daily life, chronic vs. acute) and responses (e.g., affective, physiological) on health outcomes and develop evidence-based pro- grams to modify negative health trajectories. The current proposal's specific aims are to investigate age differ- ences in how: (1) stress responses become more decoupled across stressor modality (lab vs. daily life); (2) such decoupling of stress responses is related to poorer health; and (3) repeated stress exposure alters stressor-health links. Aims 1 and 2 will be achieved via the analysis of existing longitudinal measurement burst data: the Multi-Method Ambulatory Assessment (MMAA) project. Aim 3 will be tested with the collection of new pilot data of repeated assessments of stressor responses. Both datasets will include affective and cardiovascu- lar responses to a psychosocial laboratory stressor and daily life stressors. MMAA participants (N=92) com- pleted a mental arithmetic stressor (including affective and heart rate variability (HRV) reactivity), followed by a 24-hour ambulatory assessment period of HRV and 6 ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of stressors and momentary affect in daily life. Baseline stress responses will be linked to health indicators (e.g., health conditions) concurrently and prospectively (1 and 4 years later). The pilot study (N = 180 stratified by younger and older adults; gender; and European Americans and Latinos/Hispanics) will include 7 days of EMA surveys (of momentary affect and daily stressors) and ambulatory physiological data (physical activity, heart rate varia- bility, and sleep patterns) with 3 repeated lab stressors with affective and cardiovascular responses on days 2, 4, and 6. Stress responses will be linked to self-reported and objective health indicators (e.g., endothelial func- tion via flow-mediated vasodilation), elucidating age differences in stressor-health pathways."
"9442803","ABSTRACT: My ultimate goal is to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms that control retinal development in order to identify novel targets to regenerate tissues lost in the retinal degenerative diseases. These blinding disorders have few treatments and afflict the majority of individuals I care for as a retinal physician and surgeon. For example, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in which photoreceptors degenerate leading to vision loss, is a disease that affects 10 million Americans. One regenerative strategy for AMD is pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived photoreceptor transplantation. However, derivation of PSC-derived retinal progenitor cells (RPCs)?tissue-specific precursors to photoreceptors?remains inefficient, donor-dependent, and poorly understood. To better understand how RPCs arise, and to achieve the initial steps of my career goals, I have planned a three-year, mentored career development program designed to foster my transition to an independent investigator. I have devised didactic and hands-on training aims that integrate stem cells and chromatin dynamics with state-of-the-art epigenetic techniques. This work will take place at University of Michigan (U-M), an outstanding environment with a track record of nurturing young faculty toward independent research careers. My primary mentor, Yali Dou, is an internationally recognized expert in the field of epigenetic regulation of transcription. Sally Temple, co-mentor, is a pioneer in neural stem cells and in defining their developmental transcriptome. Thomas Gardner, U-M K12 Principal Investigator and senior clinician-scientist, whose work focuses on diabetic retinopathy, will serve as a career mentor. This diverse and accomplished team will foster my training aims, career goals, and my efforts to address the central research theme: how an epigenetic enzyme, Mll1, orchestrates formation of RPCs from PSCs. The rationale for this proposal is that by determining the role of Mll1 in retinal differentiation, knowledge will be gained about unknown epigenetic mechanisms that govern retinal formation. We have recently discovered the Mll1-Rx retinal developmental axis, and have also found that Mll1 regulates retinal Meis1. Dysregulation of Mll1, Meis1, or Rx disrupts mammalian retinal development, but how this occurs remains unknown. To address this knowledge gap, the proposed research aims to: 1) determine whether Mll1 deficiency impairs generation of RPCs via Meis1 and Rx repression; and 2) define Mll1-dependent transcriptome and enhancer networks within the retinal Mll1-Rx axis. To accomplish these aims, I will learn and apply innovative technologies such as gene editing, RNA interference, ChIP- and RNA-sequencing, and enhancer motif analysis. This integrated pipeline will allow genome-wide interrogation of targetable and clinically relevant epigenetic pathways in retinal development, and could ultimately be applied to retinal disease. Together, the insights, skills, and guidance gained from the proposed studies, career development plan, and mentorship team will facilitate my transition from a mentored clinician investigator to an independent, R01-supported, translational scientist."
"9447162","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Morning hyperglycemia plays a role in the future development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is associated with numerous microvascular and cardiovascular complications and renal disease. These augmented morning glucose levels are due to an elevated endogenous glucose production (EGP), as a result of a loss of coordination between glucose levels and insulin secretion, and possibly hyperglucagonemia during the overnight period. Exercise stimulates glucose uptake and increases insulin sensitivity acutely, and may be the best lifestyle intervention to minimize the nocturnal rise in glucose levels. Prescription of the timing of exercise relative to a meal and/or o the overnight period may be particularly critical for individuals that have impaired fasting glucos (IFG) levels. Surprisingly we know little about the overnight period when elevated EGP and the synchrony between glucose and c-peptide/glucagon levels becomes disturbed. This novel study will provide insight into the hormonal/metabolic milieu of a dinner meal, the evening and overnight period that occurs in non-obese, OB and OB+IFG individuals; it will also establish if the timing of exercise can attenuate nocturnal glucose elevations, and if this is associated with improved hormonal synchrony. This project will compare EGP, ?-cell function and hormonal responses between morning and evening exercise on the postprandial and overnight period in obese individuals with/without IFG levels. Fifty-four subjects will be studied during the evening meal (EGP and ?-cell function), postprandially and through the overnight period (1600-0700 h), allowing us to examine some of the potential mechanisms for the elevation in overnight glucose levels. This is the first study that will examine this issue from pre-dinner through the night whil previous studies have only examined chronically fasted individuals and this study will lay the groundwork for understanding the pathology of the predawn phenomena in OB+IFG individuals. These potentially translational findings may impact the efficiency of physician communication to patients concerning exercise. We are one of the few groups that study subjects through the overnight period and have the facilities and capability to do this research."
"9500612","Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of this research program is to develop cost-effective strategies to increase moderate- intensity physical activity (PA) among sedentary women. Fewer than half of U.S. women meet recommendations for moderate-intensity PA, and thereby are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. When provided a PA program, between 25-60% of women either fail to adopt it or fail to adhere after six months. PA health benefits are further negatively impacted by the fact that sedentary behavior at many worksites exacerbates low PA. Among efficacious treatments for increasing PA for women, four have had promising results: (1) enhanced PA monitor treatment (PA monitor with goal setting and a PA prescription); (2) motivational text messages; (3) motivational personal calls; and (4) group meetings. While each of these treatments has proven efficacy, they differ on resource use and cost, and there is heterogeneity in response. When treatments have heterogeneity of response, adaptive interventions can help close that gap. Adaptive interventions start with an initial treatment and then transition to an augmented treatment for non-responders. This study aims to determine the most effective adaptive intervention combining four efficacious treatments (enhanced PA monitor, motivational text messages, motivational personal calls, group meetings) to increase PA (step counts per day, minutes moderate/vigorous PA per week) and improve cardiovascular health (aerobic fitness, body composition) among sedentary employed women. We will also assess treatment effects on intervention targets (PA benefits, PA barriers, PA self-efficacy, and social support). A Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design will address the following aims: 1) Among non-responders to the initial treatments (enhanced PA monitor and enhanced PA monitor+ motivational text messages), compare the two augmented treatments (motivational personal calls and group meetings); 2a) Compare the two initial treatments and; 2b) Compare the four adaptive interventions embedded in the SMART on PA and cardiovascular health; 3) Identify mediators and moderators of the initial and augmented treatments on PA and cardiovascular health; 4) Compare the cost-effectiveness of the four adaptive interventions from the societal perspective which includes both program costs and participant costs. We will recruit 312 sedentary women, aged 18 to 65, who are employed at a large urban academic medical center. Data will be collected on PA (self- report, device), cardiovascular health, PA benefits, PA barriers, PA self-efficacy, social support, and program and participant costs. Data will be collected at baseline, weeks 9-10 (when response to initial treatment is assessed), weeks 34 -35, and weeks 51-52. We expect to identify an optimal adaptive intervention for improving PA and cardiovascular health that minimizes costs and burden to women who respond to less intensive treatments, while maximizing benefits for those who need a more intensive approach."
"9573905","We are requesting funds to acquire the Olympus FV3000 confocal microscopy imaging system through the Shared Equipment Evaluation Program (ShEEP) under the Research Equipment Management program offered by the Office of Research and Development (ORD). Olympus Corporation (Center Valley, PA, USA) manufactures the FV3000 system and is the sole source provider due to their unique buy-back system for our current outdated equipment. The requested Olympus system is a multifunctional integrative modular system that offers a user friendly interface, acquisition and analysis software, and produces high quality images over a broad range of microscopy uses. The Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope system will replace the outdated FV300 Olympus confocal system that has been in use for approximately 18 years. This system is out of warranty and has limited imaging capabilities, using low-resolution capture systems that are not comparable to modern imaging devices. Its outdated gas laser technology will soon need to be replaced and the software interface is no longer supported. Because this new Olympus microscope is significantly easier to use, and has much faster acquisition times, we anticipate major cost savings by reducing the person-hours required to obtain high quality, publication-ready images. The system is capable of performing automated cell counting, time-lapse imaging, calcium flux imaging and imaging of prepared tissue. As configured in the quotation, the system also can image live cells and whole animals. The underlying imaging technology and flexible programming makes this equipment a ?next generation? system on the cutting edge of laboratory microscopy. Light emitting diodes (LED) lasers are the source of illumination and significantly enhance the imaging capabilities, offering a superior and safer alternative to traditional mercury arc light sources. These lasers are also much more economic with very long lifespans. We recently received funding for another imaging system that allows for rapid imaging of fixed and living tissues and cells. However this EVOS system is not a confocal microscope and does not offer the flexibility that the Olympus system offers. In addition, since much of our previous data was obtained with the outdated Olympus system, the similar yet updated methodology used with the proposed new system will provide seamless results that will be more easily comparable to previously obtained images. In addition, estimates of the number of investigators using the EVOS system projected maximal use at 40 hrs per week. The addition of the Olympus system will allow expansion of imaging techniques by other investigators which will enhance the recruitment capabilities of the Minneapolis VAHCS Research Department. We anticipate that the acquisition of this equipment will further modernize our core Research microscopy capabilities, with the end goal of increasing support for and the efficiency of our ongoing translational VA research. If funded, the instrument will be housed within a dedicated imaging room in the Minneapolis VAHCS Research Service. Dr. Krug and the Minneapolis VAHCS Research Office will oversee the training and usage of the equipment under the full support of Minneapolis VAHCS Director, Mr. Patrick J. Kelly and the Research & Development Committee. The identified major and minor users collectively represent numerous VA research disciplines from both basic and translational research (neuroscience, cardiovascular research, cancer, stem cell therapies, obesity, and Gulf War Illness). At least 85% of the instrument capacity will be used by VA funded researchers and less than 25% will be occupied by minor users. In order to maintain the status of the Minneapolis VAHCS as one of the largest and most active research programs, it is critical that cutting edge technology be available to our researchers. The addition of this microscopy system would facilitate research from multiple disciplines to acquire and analyze data to address the specific needs of US Veterans. Further, this would foster multidisciplinary collaborations between Minneapolis VAHCS colleagues and promote collaborative, benchtop to translational science that would benefit all Americans."
"9441738","ABSTRACT Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and Meckel syndrome (MKS) are examples of simple and complex recessive forms of PKD, respectively. ARPKD is considered a monogenic disease, due to PKHD1 mutations, while 16 genes, most commonly TMEM67, cause MKS. They are representatives of a larger group of diseases that result in PKD due to defects in the functioning of primary cilia, ciliopathies. During the previous funding period, increasingly complex mutation screening protocols from Sanger sequencing, through ciliopathy gene panels, to whole exome sequencing (WES) were employed to analyze patients. Further genetic and allelic heterogeneity was found for both diseases, along with evidence of oligogenic inheritance. Mutation screening will continue here employing WES and sophisticated in silico, including 3D modeling approaches, to score variants of uncertain significance (VUS) (Aim 1). Preliminary explorations were made by cellular assays to measure surface localization and protein maturation of the TMEM67 membrane protein, meckelin, with some mutations found to cause folding defects, which were rescued in an enhanced protein-folding environment, lower temperature. Here, cellular assays will be employed for meckelin and the Pkhd1 protein, fibrocystin (FPC), to assess the pathogenicity, penetrance and rescue ability of VUS (Aim 2). The value of potential chemical chaperones to rescue the maturation/localization of folding mutants will be tested employing the cellular systems. Mouse models mimicking the adult ciliopathy phenotypes associated with TMEM67 mutations, such as Joubert syndrome (JBTS), will be generated by engineering two homozygous, hypomorphic, folding mutations employing the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing method (Aim 3). The adult phenotype will be characterized and chaperone treatment tested. Another discovery during the previous funding period was the greatly enhanced renal phenotype when a Pkhd1 null model (Pkhd1LSL/LSL) and the autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) gene, Pkd1, hypomorphic model, Pkd1RC/RC were interbred. While both models alone had a mild renal cystic phenotype, the digenic animals had explosive PKD and early lethality. Here, the pathogenesis associated with the loss of Pkhd1 to make the digenic model will be analyzed by RNA seq and cilia analysis (Aim 4). Since functional Pkhd1 can be reactivated, as a tagged gene/protein (Pkhd1PK) from the Pkhd1LSL model, we will determine if somatic reactivation of Pkhd1 alters the course of the PKD (Aim 4). Using a global expressing Cre, Pkhd1 will be activated at P3 and P14 and the resulting phenotype and expression profile analyzed. This is an important preliminary experiment to determine the phenotypic value of somatic repair of Pkhd1 in this disorder. Overall this study will contribute major insight into the etiology and pathogenicity of recessive forms of PKD, and provide clues for therapeutics."
"9488797","Project Summary/abstract Herpes simplex virus (HSV) persists for life in peripheral neurons in the form of a latent infection. In response to neuronal stress, the virus reactivates from latency to permit reinfection. Reactivation is associated with significant disease. For example, replication in the cornea following reactivation results in keratitis. Transmission to the central nervous system following reactivation can result in herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). Without treatment, HSE has a fatality rate of 70%, and even with treatment, many survivors exhibit long-term sequelae. Although anti-viral drugs are available that limit HSV productive replication, no therapies target the latent stage of infection to prevent reactivation and there is no vaccine against HSV. Therefore, our long-term goals are to understand how HSV responds to neuronal stress and develop strategies to prevent reactivation occurring. Our lab and others have shown that the mechanism by which viral gene expression initiates during reactivation is distinct from de novo infection with the virus. We have found that a neuronal stress pathway resulting in activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) triggers changes to the viral chromatin and permits reactivation. Specifically, the histones associated with viral promoters maintained a modification associated with heterochromatin (H3K9me3) but also became phosphorylated on H3S10 in a JNK-dependent manner. Using both a primary neuronal model of HSV-1 latency that we have developed and mouse models of infection we will determine how activation of JNK permits viral gene expression to be induced during reactivation. By performing ChIP-seq and shRNA knock-down of candidate proteins, we will examine how JNK gets recruited to viral promoters and identify additional cellular proteins involved in HSV-1 reactivation. We will also determine how JNK signaling overcomes the H3K27me3 repressive histone medication to permit reactivation from genomes associated with this modification. Finally, we will examine the mechanism that ATRX restricts HSV-1 reactivation and test the hypothesis that genomes associated with ATRX are non- permissive for reactivation. These studies into the intimate interaction between the latent viral genome and initiation of a neuronal stress response are especially significant as they provide mechanistic insight into how the virus undergoes reactivation. Because the virus has likely co-opted cellular pathway to achieve reactivation, we will also uncover process that are important for the host response to neuronal stress. Importantly, by understanding the very earliest events in HSV reactivation, our long-term goals are to develop therapies that target the latent genome and make it unresponsive for reactivation."
"9539311","Project Summary Relapse to cocaine abuse is associated with cellular and molecular adaptations in both neurons and astrocytes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Cocaine-induced adaptations observed in NAc astrocytes include changes in cellular morphology and synaptic contact, as well as disruptions in glutamate homeostasis. Disruptions in glutamate homeostasis lead to maladaptive changes in glutamatergic signaling and plasticity that are believed to drive relapse to cocaine use. Accordingly, elucidation of the mechanism(s) responsible for cocaine-induced disruptions in glutamate homeostasis and astroglial signaling is of great interest. Glutamate homeostasis is maintained in part by the astroglial glutamate transporter GLT-1. In animal models of cocaine use, short-access (ShA) cocaine self-administration and extinction training, as well as long-access (LgA) cocaine self- administration and withdrawal, both result in the downregulation of GLT-1 protein expression in the NAc. Moreover, restored expression of GLT-1 in the NAc prevents reinstatement to cocaine seeking. Although a decrease in GLT-1 protein is observed in both of these widely-used models, preliminary data show that a decrease in GLT-1 mRNA is only observed after LgA cocaine self-administration and withdrawal, suggesting a dual mechanism of GLT-1 regulation by cocaine. Furthermore, preliminary data shows that the GLT-1 gene is hypermethylated in the NAc after LgA cocaine self-administration and withdrawal, providing one molecular mechanism for the decrease in GLT-1 mRNA. The experiments outlined in this proposal are designed to expand on these exciting findings by further investigating the relationship between epigenetic regulation of GLT-1 expression, astrocyte morphology, and cocaine seeking after protracted withdrawal from LgA cocaine self- administration. In Aim 1, I will determine whether these preliminary data obtained from male rats also extend to female rats. To further characterize the epigenetic changes to GLT-1, Aim 1 will also assess histone modifications associated with the GLT-1 gene after LgA cocaine self-administration and withdrawal. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that blocking DNA methylation will decrease cocaine seeking after prolonged withdrawal by a GLT-1-dependent mechanism. In Aim 3, I will test the hypothesis that AAV-mediated overexpression of GLT- 1 in astrocytes will block the cocaine-induced decrease in astrocyte surface area, volume, and synaptic localization. This will be accomplished by overexpression of GLT-1 together with a membrane-tagged GFP selectively in astrocytes so that morphometric properties of astrocytes can be measured in cells positive and negative for GLT-1 overexpression. I hypothesize that withdrawal from LgA self-administration will lead to a significant reduction in astrocyte surface area, volume, and synaptic colocalization, and that this effect will be blocked by GLT-1 overexpression. These experiments will allow for analysis of the mechanistic relationships between the effects of LgA cocaine on behavior, GLT-1 expression, and astrocyte morphology."
"9567670","Abstract The interplay between the human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1), CD4+ T cell subset numbers and function and central nervous system disease is the focus of this proposal now in its 24th year. During the prior investigative cycle systemic viral infection was not shown to influence nigrostriatal degeneration for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, effector immune responses for both innate and adaptive immunity were operative in PD, HIV-1, traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease (AD). All can be ameliorated by immune transformation and can forestall neurodegenerative activities. While age dependent neurodegeneration in HIV/AIDS is linked to ?-synuclein neural inclusions and amyloid-? (A?) accumulation virus-induction of disease is less certain. What is rests in the interplay between immunity and misfolded proteins are serving as disease effectors. We posit that virus-induced neuroinflammation affect neurodegenerative disease. This is based on the notion that mononuclear phagocytes (MP: microglia and perivascular macrophages) and CD4+ T lymphocyte produce factors that affect the brain's microenvironment and can be transformed for therapeutic gains. T cell immunity drives the tempo of disease. To extend such observations we will determine the roles of adaptive immunity in affecting cognitive, behavior and neuropathobiology in the setting of HIV/AIDS and neurodegenerative diseases. We will generate HIV-1-infected and AD biogenesis rodents and use them to better understand disease events. We will elucidate the interplay between virus, immunity and brain subregion disease as well as A? biopathogenesis. These events will be linked to neuronal vitality. The interplay between CD4+ T cells and MP is a principal disease event while regulatory T cells are central to neuroprotective outcomes."
"9499536","Abstract  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the first identified human tumor virus, transforms resting B-cells into rapidly growing lymphoblasts. EBV-driven lymphomas cause significant disease in patients with primary or acquired immunodeficiency, including post-transplantation, with HIV co-infection or with age-related immune-senescence. EBV transforms human B-cells through a program that involves at least three early stages. First, EBV causes major B-cell anabolic remodeling, prior to cell cycle entry. Second, EBV then drives rapid Burkitt-lymphoma (BL) like B-cell growth, triggering cell division every 8-12 hours. Finally, EBV LMP1 and 2A oncoprotein expression cause a transition to lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL)-like growth, where cells divide daily and complete the immortalization program. To achieve this remarkable transition, EBV subverts key host metabolic networks to provide energy, biosynthetic building blocks and protection from reactive oxygen species. Yet, comprehensive approaches have not been used to identify key EBV-targeted mitochondrial metabolic pathways that underlie EBV-mediated B-cell growth transformation. We therefore used multiplexed mass spectrometry to create a temporal proteomic map of EBV-mediated primary human B-cell transformation, and used genome-wide CRISPR screens to identify EBV-induced B-cell dependency factors. These approaches identified a central role for EBV-induced mitochondrial one-carbon (1C) metabolism, an embryonic program that enables rapid cell growth but which is shut off in many adult tissues. Our preliminary data indicates that EBV oncoproteins induce 1C metabolism, including in a mouse model of lymphoproliferative disease. Our central hypothesis is that EBV-induced mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism has critical but distinct roles in each stage of EBV- mediated B-cell growth transformation. Our Specific Aims are therefore to: 1) Identify the role of EBV-induced 1C metabolism in primary B-cell remodeling; (2) Identify the role of one-carbon metabolism in support of rapid Burkitt-like growth; (3) Identify mitochondrial 1C roles in LCL-like cell redox defense. Collectively, these studies are expected to identify how EBV subverts a key embryonic mitochondrial pathway to enable potent growth transformation. 1C metabolism has not been studied in EBV pathogenesis, but is closely related to host enzyme targets blocked by antifolate lymphoma therapies. Our studies may therefore support strategies to develop rational therapeutic regimens to halt EBV-associated malignancies."
"9528114","PROJECT SUMMARY: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading nosocomial infection and the primary identifiable cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It can lead to multiple CDI recurrences, sepsis, toxic megacolon, and death. Recurrent CDI (rCDI) complicates 20-30% of primary episodes of disease is associated with an increased risk of death (nearly 45,000 deaths per year) and a poor quality of life. While probiotics, new biologic therapies, and fecal transplantation have met with some success in breaking the cycle of rCDI, there remains a need for simple, safe, and cost-effective solutions to this problem. We have assembled three independent, converging lines of evidence that suggest the already FDA-approved drug misoprostol (a prostaglandin analog) as a candidate for preventing rCDI. First, there is an emerging epidemiologic association between the clinical use of inhibitors of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis and an increased risk for CDI. Second, we performed a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) based on ICD-9 billing code and genotype data in a disease-agnostic cohort of ~40,000 patients. We used PheWAS to identify potential novel genotype-phenotype associations related to the SNPs in the genes for the targets of misoprostol (PGE2 receptors). This innovative analysis predicted a potential new indication for misoprostol to treat (or prevent) C. difficile colitis. Third, we obtained preclinical data from a mouse model of antibiotic-associated CDI that show misoprostol has beneficial effects against CDI. In order to take they key next step in translating these findings into the clinic, we are planning a phase II proof of concept study: A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF MISOPROSTOL IN THE PREVENTION OF FIRST RECURRENCE OF CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION IN ADULTS AGED 50 AND OVER. We propose three aims: (1) Evaluate the safety and efficacy of misoprostol for prevention of rCDI, by determining if misoprostol can modify the rate and severity of rCDI in adults ?50 years of age during the first 8 weeks after standard oral vancomycin therapy is completed; (2) Determine the effect of misoprostol on the gut microbiome and metabolome, diarrhea occurrence/severity, and the development of anti-C. difficile toxin antibodies, in order to inform the design of future studies, and (3) Continue the clinical development of misoprostol to optimize its potential to impact clinical practice and rapidly affect human health. The successful completion of these studies could have rapid clinical impact in the prevention of rCDI infection. Additionally, the scope of this work goes well beyond initial clinical proof of concept and also includes elements of real-world translation including production of an optimized formulation of the drug, a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss bridging studies needed for 505(b)(2) approval, and conduction of preliminary bridging studies based on input from the FDA. 1"
"9448521","Understanding CTCF boundaries controlling Hox gene expression Summary Spatial and temporal control of gene expression is crucial for the development of multicellular organisms. Although changes in looping interactions between enhancers and transcription start sites is an acknowledged mode of gene regulation, the contribution of larger 3D genomic reorganizations to gene expression and normal development is largely obscure. We propose experiments to clarify how the CTCF transcription factor controls chromatin structure at the Hox clusters to ensure proper Hox gene expression and thus, body patterning. During embryonic development, precise expression of Hox genes instructs cells to recognize their relative position in body axes. Hox genes are organized in four clusters with individual genes in these clusters expressed in patterns that are spatially and temporally collinear with their physical chromosomal organization. Collinear Hox gene expression along the spinal cord controls motor neuron (MN) subtypes and thus their connectivity. During MN differentiation, the Hox clusters undergo a chromatin and 3-D reorganization from a single repressed state to two domains harboring either transcribed or repressed genes. The two chromatin states are insulated by CTCF binding at the boundary, maintaining stable Hox chromatin states inherited though development to ensure proper MN connectivity. Of relevance, we recently demonstrated that the CTCF boundary is essential to normal body patterning during embryonic development in vivo. To understand how CTCF maintains insulated chromatin and 3-D boundaries at Hox clusters we propose: 1) To understand how disrupting the CTCF-mediated chromatin boundary affects subtype identity of spinal MNs; 2) To determine the molecular basis of establishing a CTCF-dependent boundary; 3) An advanced proteomics study to identify factors required by chromatin associated CTCF for its insulator activity, emphasizing those whose interaction is RNA-dependent."
"9505990","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing a genetic network diagram of the primate brain linked to social disorders is one of the major challenges of modern neurobiology and medicine. Nowhere is this need clearer than in social-emotional systems, where dysregulation of circuitry is implicated in mental illnesses: autism, depression and anxiety. We will generate multiple-gene-specific 3D reconstructions from serial sections of long range axon projections of social circuitry in primate, including hypothalamus, bed nucleus and stria terminalis, basal forebrain nuclei, amygdala and basal ganglia, and integrate with MRI. This will address two barriers to understanding primate brain and human social behavior; lack of knowledge of endogenous circuitry, and lack of computational systems for large scale multicolor axon projections in serial registration and for handling the terabyte datasets. We have generated a novel pipeline of multicolor confocal image acquisition integrated with a computational suite of algorithms for reconstructing and visualizing TB image sets. We have applied these to generate a 3D reconstruction of 45,295,200 images (1,620mm) at the axon level for social circuitry involving oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) and the Williams syndrome gene, GTF2IRD1, all implicated in social behavior. We have identified novel OT and AVP structures and sparse tracts that may fill critical gaps as substrates and biomarkers for human behavior. Moreover, we have developed approaches for hierarchical 3D integration of axon-level images to MRI images. The proposal emerges from a unique multidimensional team and advisors*; experts in segmentation, large scale image reconstruction and 3D visualization (Tasdizen, Joshi, Pascucci, Roysam*), in primate brain circuitry and neuroanatomy (Angelucci, Hof*, Dong*, Korenberg), in animal and human MRI (Hsu, Joshi), and in genetics and multicolor fluorescence imaging of axon projections (Korenberg, Angelucci). We will: 1) Establish a genetic wiring diagram of axonal projections for OT, AVP and GTF2IRD1 in macaque. We will generate, validate and image more than 667 serial coronal sections (21,100mm) of macaque brains multicolor fluorescence immunohistochemistry of ligands and their receptors, using confocal microscopy and tract tracing. Pre-/post-mortem MRI(150-200mm resolution) and block-faces images will be acquired. Novel circuitry will be validated in cognate regions of human brain. 2) Build a Neural Information System that integrates and visualizes a multiscale volumetric TB dataset of primate genetic connectivity for social neuropeptides, aligned using automated slice-to-slice image registration at the resolution of axonal projections to MRI, and annotated neuroanatomy. The results will identify novel OT/AVP related social circuitry and establish a pipeline of integrated technologies for bridging (macro)connectome with (micro)axome and both with genetics of mental illness. These will provide novel biomarkers for disease features and receptor targets, and accelerate translating the dissonant orchestration of social behavior by neuropeptides to therapeutic harmony in humans."
"9500863","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disorder marked by loss of motor neurons of the spinal cord and cortex. ALS is characterized by significant heterogeneity in disease onset and patient presentation. Over the last twenty years, mutations in over 35 different genes have been uncovered as causal in the development of familial forms of ALS (fALS); however, fALS only accounts for roughly 10% of all ALS cases. The remaining 90% of patients suffer from sporadic ALS (sALS), with no family history of disease and unknown causes of pathogenesis. Regardless of all this genetic and pathogenic complexity, remarkably nearly every single ALS patient (both fALS and sALS) share a common neuropathology in the form of aberrant cytoplasmic inclusions of a protein called TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) found in degenerating regions of the nervous system. Insight drawn from studies of fALS-linked mutations have implicated stress granule dysfunction in disease development, but the exact mechanisms by which the stress granules may directly regulate TDP-43 aggregation remains unclear. By utilizing a novel optogenetic approach to induce either TDP-43 inclusions or functional stress granules, we can manipulate these processes at a previously unattainable level of control. These experiments will explore the contribution of stress granule dysfunction to TDP-43 inclusion neurotoxicity. We hypothesize that perturbations in stress granule dynamics contribute to neurotoxic TDP-43 aggregation in ALS. We will first investigate the contribution of stress granules to light-induced TDP-43 inclusions. We will then determine if chronic or persistent stress granule formation initiates TDP-43 proteinopathy. Finally, we will perform a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify novel pathways that protect against TDP-43 inclusion toxicity and assess whether this protection is dependent on stress granule regulation."
"9445383","Immune function declines with age. In order to extend quality of life, it is critical that we understand mechanisms underlying the age-associated decline in immune function. Humans are riddled throughout life with a variety of acute and chronic infections which trigger the immune system. The accumulating effect of acute and chronic infections throughout the lifespan profoundly impacts the T cell repertoire and immune response of aged individuals. Although the aging mouse model provides a robust experimental model amenable to addressing mechanisms, it is increasingly realized that an important limitation of the mouse model is that mice are typically housed in specific pathogen free conditions. Immune senescence cannot be appropriately modeled in mice in which antigen experience has been deliberately constrained. In addition, optimal immune responses to new infections are thought to be dependent on a diverse repertoire of naïve T cells. With age, the numbers and diversity of naïve T cells decline and the ratio of memory to naïve T cells greatly increases. It has been determined that T cell recognition of antigen/MHC is highly degenerate and T cell responses exhibit extensive and unexpected cross reactivity. We hypothesize that, with the declining numbers of naïve T cells with age, the response to new infections become increasingly dependent on memory cells that accumulated with antigen experience and are fortuitously cross reactive. The first goal of this proposal is to develop a better mouse model for aging by defined exposure early in life to sequential infection with chronic and acute viruses. The second goal of this developmental R21 is to test the hypothesis that sequentially-infected aged mice, by virtue of enhanced antigen experience, will manifest increased diversity in the memory T cell repertoire capable of cross- reacting with new infections. Accomplishing the goals of this developmental R21 will be an important advance for aging research. Studies in antigen-experienced aged mice will benefit understanding the impact of antigen experience on immunity and senescence in elderly humans and has important implications for vaccination strategies for the elderly, supporting the concept that vaccines in young and middle age are important for maintaining immunity in later life."
"9443626","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The shortage of organs for kidney transplantation for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is magnified in Hispanics/Latin Americans. Hispanics have a disproportionately higher prevalence of ESRD, yet receive fewer kidney transplants compared to non-Hispanic whites. Living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is the treatment of choice for ESRD as it confers better patient and graft survival, shorter waiting time, and better quality of life than deceased donor kidney transplantation. However, compared to their representation on the waiting list, fewer Hispanics received a LDKT than non-Hispanic whites in 2013: 4 percent versus 10 percent. Barriers to LDKT for Hispanics include: lack of knowledge, cultural concerns, and language barriers. The disparity will likely worsen without intervention as Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the US.  Few available culturally competent interventions have led to increased LDKT rates. Interventions rarely address Hispanic cultural concerns, and there are no published models of transplant center-based only programs. The Chicago Northwestern Medicine's(r) Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program (HKTP), a culturally and linguistically competent program, has increased Hispanic LDKTs. The mean annual ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs grew from 0.20 in 2001-2006 to 0.34 in 2008-2013, a 70 percent increase (p<0.001).  The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate the HKTP, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations (Dallas, TX, and Los Angeles, CA), with Northwestern University serving as the Study Coordinating Center. The pre-post HKTP intervention study will evaluate the effect of the HKTP's key culturally sensitive components (outreach, communication, education) on Hispanic LDKT rates, compared to matched controls. The specific aims are to:  1. Implement the HKTP at two transplant centers by conducting a needs assessment of barriers and using a learning collaborative model to deliver HKTP protocols, scripts, and materials.  2. Conduct a pre-post HKTP intervention evaluation with matched controls to assess if the HKTP is associated with an increase in: a) the ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs as a function of an absolute increase in Hispanic LDKTs, b) ESRD Hispanic patient additions to the waiting list, c) Hispanic potential donors per potential recipient, and d) Hispanic patients' satisfaction with care.  3. Formatively evaluate the fidelity and innovative adaptations to HKTP's outreach, communication, and education at both study sites to identify effective components of the HTKP, using mixed methods.  As an exploratory aim, a budget impact analysis will be conducted to construct a business case for transplant centers and permit estimates of HKTP scalability. The proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly disseminate the HKTP as a novel approach to increase Hispanic LDKTs nationally, improve health outcomes for Hispanics, and close the LDKT disparity gap."
"9648664","The filoviruses are NIAID/CDC Category A biodefense pathogens that cause severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever with 50-90% human lethality. There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or therapies for filovirus infection. Among the filoviruses, the Zaire Ebola virus species (EBOV) has been most extensively characterized. However, outbreaks ofthe Sudan Ebola virus species (SUDV) and Marburg virus (MARV) have been occurring with increased frequency and can be just as lethal as EBOV. Further, the pathogenic Bundibugyo Ebola virus species (BDBV) re-emerged in 2012 with increased lethality. Immunotherapy was recently demonstrated to provide post-exposure protection to EBOV challenge in nonhuman primates (NHPs). For MARV, convalescent sera from immunized NHPs can provide similar protection, suggesting that immunotherapy for all filoviruses will be tractable in humans. A robust pipeline of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting EBOV exists and will be developed in Project 1, but the pipeline for SUDV and MARV mAbs is less complete. Not a single SUDV or MARV mAb or mAb cocktail therapy has been evaluated in NHPs. Currently, there are no neutralizing BDBV mAbs. The goal of Project 2 is to fill these gaps in the filovirus therapeutic mAb portfolio. Among consortium investigators, a total of 216 murine mAbs against SUDV or MARV are available but have not been completely characterized; we will develop these mAbs and evaluate them for protection in rodent models and NHPs. In addition, we will identify new SUDV and MARV mAbs from human survivors of infection from outbreaks in Uganda, especially those in 2012. The consortium investigators have unprecedented access to four separate survivor cohorts of SUDV and MARV infection, and have demonstrated recently that neutralizing mAbs exist in peripheral blood of survivors. In addition, we will identify and characterize new anti-BDBV and broadly reactive anti-filovirus mAbs. Preliminary ELISA studies indicate that antibodies with cross-reactivity for the envelope glycoprotein (GP) from SUDV, BDBV and (in some cases) EBOV exist in peripheral blood of survivors who have been exposed to only a single filovirus species. We will use human hybridoma and antibody phage display technologies to screen the lymphocytes of survivors of filovirus infection for new BDBV and cross neutralizing filovirus mAbs. The most promising candidates will be further evaluated in rodent and nonhuman primate challenge models. The end-point of this work will be a robust pipeline of mAbs for these understudied and re-emerging filoviruses."
"9437731","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy. MM has a prolonged clinically detectable premalignant phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) that can be identified by detection of the secreted monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) and through the presence of an abnormal immunoglobulin kappa/lambda free light chain (FLC) ratio. Over the last 10 years we have extensively characterized the various precursor stages of MM, and conducted numerous studies establishing monoclonal elevations of FLC and abnormalities in the FLC ratio as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, response assessment, and risk stratification across a spectrum of plasma cell disorders. One of the goals of this renewal is to determine why MGUS occurs, and whether polyclonal plasma cell proliferation in response to infection or inflammation plays a role in pathogenesis of MGUS, MM and related malignancies. We are also investigating the reasons for dramatic racial disparity in incidence of MM; young blacks for example have a 3-fold higher risk than whites. Our studies show that a major reason for the racial discrepancy is a marked excess in the incidence of the precursor MGUS phase in blacks. Similarly, we have uncovered a significant familial predisposition in MGUS and MM. Since MM consists of multiple unique entities from a cytogenetic standpoint, we need to determine the precise cytogenetic subtypes responsible for racial disparity and familial predisposition. Thus two fundamental questions are: 1) Can we identify biomarkers that predict risk of MM prior to the premalignant MGUS stage (precursor of the precursor stage)? 2) What are the specific cytogenetic subtypes that account for the increased risk of MM in blacks and in first degree-relatives? In Aim 1 we will determine if polyclonal elevations of serum immunoglobulin FLC are associated with an increased risk of MGUS, MM and related B cell malignancies in a large cohort of nearly 16,000 patients. In Aim 2 we will assemble and study a cohort of 800 blacks with MM to identify the specific cytogenetic subtype(s) of MM associated with increased risk of MM, and also identify predictors of response to therapy and survival. In Aim 3 we will conduct studies to identify the specific cytogenetic subtypes associated with familial predisposition in MGUS. We believe our studies are highly innovative, and will have a far-reaching impact on our understanding of the etiology of MGUS, and the cytogenetic basis for racial disparity and familial predisposition. Our studies will result in a promising biomarker to identify patients at high risk for MM and related malignancies in the general population. Aims 2 and 3 will have a major impact on the management of patients with MGUS and MM, especially African Americans and first-degree relatives or persons with MGUS."
"9575536","The purpose of this application is to secure funding to purchase an UltraMicroscope II Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscope (LSFM) for use by multiple investigators with different research disciplines including neural, muscle, and bone biology, collectively called neuromusculoskeletal biology, at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center (RLR VAMC) at Indianapolis. Neuromusculoskeletal disorders are highly VA-related medical problems, and are urgently unmet medical need. At the RLR VAMC in Indianapolis, strong interactions and collaborations have been established among multiple investigators with expertise in neuromusculoskeletal disorders. With the purchase of the UltraMicroscope II LSFM, which can be used by VA investigators of different disciplines, such collaborations could be further enhanced. The UltraMicroscope II LSFM that we request combines the latest imaging components and proprietary light sheet technologies. This new UltraMicroscope utilizes 6 thin light sheets to excite samples while the fluorescence light is detected with a sCMOS equipped microscope that is mounted perpendicular to the plane illumination. The UltraMicroscope II LSFM serves diverse applications. It delivers superior imaging capabilities and user friendliness. The microscope has been used in different disciplines of biomedical research including neuroscience, developmental biology, immunology, and oncology, and is an idea piece of equipment for multiple PIs investigating neuromusculoskeletal disorders at RRVA. It is an innovative device that overcomes many limitations of currently used conventional approaches and will advance science with high quality, efficiency, precision, and productivity. In this application, two specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we describe the purchase and maintenance plan of the UltraMicroscope II LSFM for use by dedicated VA researchers. We have obtained a quotation from the LaVision BioTec for the UltraMicroscope II LSFM. We also discuss the recruitment of Dr. Vance Lemmon, an UltraMicroscope expert, as a consultant on this application. We further discuss the management plan of the UltraMicroscope II LSFM. In Aim 2, we discuss the enhancement of the quality of science and promotion of collaboration among dedicated VA researchers. Over the course of the past 7 years, we have established a strong and dynamic Neuromusculoskeletal research program (NMS) in the Research & Development Service. The UltraMicroscope system represents state-of-the- art light sheet technology for clear tissue imaging and can be applied to neural, muscular, skeletal, and immunological tissue under both normal and pathological conditions. As such, potential acquisition of this system would enhance the current imaging capabilities of our core facilities and allow integrated imaging of NMS tissues from a single animal and across disease states. There is currently no UltraMicroscope II LSFM at the VA or anywhere on the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) campus. Our overall objective with the acquisition of the UltraMicroscope II LSFM is to create new collaborations at RRVA that lead to innovative solutions for health problems facing our veterans. To reach our goal, we have formed a team of 9 investigators, with appointments as Research Scientist, Research Career Scientist, or Senior Research Career Scientist, and each has at least 1 active VA funded grant. Having this novel, state-of-the-art microscope will certainly open up new avenues of research and collaboration at RLR VAMC that would not be possible without it."
"9441002","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this NRSA F30 award is to provide support for my M.D. /Ph.D. training at Tufts University School of Medicine. A comprehensive training plan that encompasses both coursework and the activities associated with the proposed research is designed to facilitate the pursuit of a successful career as a clinician investigator. y proposed research investigates the mechanisms by which a quiescent neurogenic stem cell population in the olfactory epithelium (OE), horizontal basal cells (HBCs), is activated after severe injury. We have recently found that a decrease in p63, a member of the p53 tumor suppressor family, is necessary and sufficient for activation of HBCs; however, the mechanisms underlying and subsequent to p63 gene down regulation remain unknown. Understanding the mechanisms that govern p63, and thus activation, in HBCs is critical for developing targeted therapeutics for activating and expanding quiescent neural stem cell populations in humans. Notch signaling has been implicated in the regulation of p63 in a tissue-specific manner. However, the crosstalk between Notch and p63 in the OE remains unclear. My work focuses on identifying the specific roles neighboring cells play in cell-cell Notch signaling to HBCs and the molecular mechanism by which Notch signaling controls p63 gene expression. My central hypothesis is that Notch signaling from neighboring Sustentacular support cells provide critical cell-cell communication that significantly contributes to maintenance of p63 expression. This is based on my preliminary data that demonstrate that Notch overexpression increases p63 expression and suggests removal of Sustentacular support cells is necessary for HBC activation. I plan to test this hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: (1) Systematically determine how injury to each cell type in the OE is responsible for signaling HBCs to activate, and (2) determine the molecular mechanism by which Notch signaling regulates p63 transcription in HBCs. By performing this study, I will gain new knowledge on the signaling events that govern p63 regulation and HBC quiescence, which will help provide a better understanding of activation of quiescent neural stem cell populations. Thus, this work will help further the basic science understanding of neural stem cell biology and also provide a translational approach to activating dormant stem cell populations for neurologic tissue repair. The proposed research activity will be coupled with opportunities to develop communication, writing, and mentoring skills, including attending and presenting at scientific conferences, writin manuscripts and grants, and supervising undergraduate students and graduate trainees in the laboratory. Completion of these training activities will provide me with a necessary foundation to achieve my career goal of becoming an independently funded physician scientist."
"9664064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale: Lupus nephritis (LuN) is the most common severe manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Up to 50% of SLE patients develop LuN which usually requires toxic immunosuppressive therapies. Despite such aggressive treatments, up to 50% of LuN patients progress to renal failure within 5 years of diagnosis. We propose that these therapeutic failures reflect an incomplete knowledge of LuN pathogenesis. Goals: The goals of this Career Development Award (K08) application are to validate and iteratively develop a novel algorithm (Cell Distance Mapping - CDM) that is able to identify cognate cellular interactions between lymphocytes by means of computerized analysis, performed on images acquired from multi-channel immunofluorescent confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), as recently published in Science Translational Medicine. We plan to extend this algorithm to the analysis of cognate T:dendritic cell (DC) interactions and validate it by means of using several unique systems with the first comprised of a triple adoptive transfer mouse model of cell tracker-labeled, antigen-pulsed, activated DCs, wild-type T cells, and antigen-specific T cells in the context of lymph node germinal centers. The second model is comprised of mice with sex- mismatched renal allografts combined with adoptive lymphocyte transfer, wherein we are able to restrict the response of T cells based on the gender origin of the source graft antigen(s). Finally, we propose to utilize human sex-mismatched renal allografts, wherein fluorescent in-situ hybridization techniques will allow us to determine the source of antigen-presenting cells and compare their interactions with cognate and non-cognate inflammatory cells. After iterative development of the above method, we propose to apply it to examine the characteristics and make-up of the inflammatory cell infiltrate in human LuN tubulointerstitial inflammation and renal allograft rejection, specifically focusing on the role(s) of DCs, their subtypes, and relation to T cells. We also plan to relate this information to renal disease severity and disease pathogenesis in patients. The experimental methods used for the above consist of multi-channel immunofluorescent CLSM, image analysis techniques, quantitative PCR performed on mRNA from Laser Capture Microscopy samples, as well as the use of super-resolution techniques such as Ground State Depletion Microscopy. Scientific Disciplines, Encompassed by Proposed Research: Immunology, Pathology, Medical Physics. Applicable Research Areas: Autoimmunity, inflammation, transplant immunology, image analysis, molecular and cellular biology.

"9633614","Abstract:  Aberrant activation of TAL1 oncogene is associated with up to 60% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients. Its ectopic expression also led to development of leukemia or lymphoma in mice. In contrast, deletion of TAL1 in T-ALL cells lost leukemic phenotype and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the TAL1 expressing T-ALL subtype is associated with poor prognosis and high rate of relapse. These data suggest that dysregulation of TAL1 oncogene plays an important role in T-ALL leukemogenesis. However, in normal hematopoiesis, TAL1 is a hematopoietic-specific member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors required for self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells and the development of all hematopoietic lineages. Because of its relevance to normal hematopoietic differentiation and T-cell leukemia, it is critical to know how TAL1 oncogene is differentially activated in normal hematopoietic cells and T-cell acute leukemia. Understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms governing TAL1 transcriptional regulation will provide a new insight into epigenetic control of hematopoiesis as well as pathogenesis of T-ALL diseases which may lead to new strategies for leukemia diagnosis and therapeutic approaches.  We recently found that TAL1 transcription is regulated by different intra- and interchromosomal loops in normal hematopoietic and leukemia cells, respectively. These intra- and interchromosomal loops alter the cell- type specific enhancers that interact with the TAL1 promoter. Based on these data, we hypothesize that repositioning of the TAL1 gene in a close proximity with T-cell specific transcriptionally active loci within nucleus is essential for aberrantly activating TAL1 oncogene in T-ALL. In this proposal, we will investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms that connect chromatin loops with transcriptional activation decision of the TAL1 oncogene as well as elucidate the role of CTCF and enhancer regulatory elements mediated chromatin interactions in regulation of TAL1 gene during normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. The specific aims are: 1) Evaluate the role of CTCF mediated genome organization in regulation of enhancer/ promoter interaction and TAL1 transcription during hematopoiesis and T cell leukemogenesis; 2) Study the molecular mechanisms by which interchromosomal loops result in aberrant activation of TAL1 oncogene in T-ALL."

Progress made in human genetics has revealed increasingly more disease-associated genes for Alzheimer?s disease (AD), Parkinson?s disease (PD), Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative disorders. These discoveries have linked neurodegenerative diseases with several common key biological processes that have so far been under-studied, including RNA metabolism, protein trafficking and innate immune responses. By focusing on these emerging areas in neurodegenerative disease research, this conference seeks to challenge the current research paradigms and to inspire in-depth discussion and exploration. The program assembles leaders from various fields to facilitate interactions between groups using diverse approaches, by providing a platform to cross-fertilize ideas and to encourage new collaborations that could lead to novel mechanisms and therapeutic targets against neurodegenerative diseases."
"9545461","ABSTRACT Recent clinical and experimental data suggest a potential interaction between epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with seizures occurring in approximately 20% or more of AD patients, often prior to the onset of cognitive impairment. Conversely, chronic epilepsy syndromes such as temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can exhibit AD neuropathology, supporting the hypothesis that chronic excitability may promote neurodegenerative changes. Our preliminary data in AD human brain tissue show alterations in neurotransmitter (NT), ion transporter and mTOR pathway that we and others have previously observed in chronic epilepsy and TLE. Furthermore, our pilot data in 5XFAD mouse model show similar alterations including mTOR upregulation earlier in life prior to the development of AD neuropathology. Across many epilepsy models, the mTOR pathway has been shown to be critical for epileptogenesis. We hypothesize that these epilepsy-associated factors regulating neuronal hyperexcitability will be greater in AD patients compared to controls, and possibly even higher in AD patients with seizures. In addition, we will use the 5XFAD mouse model to determine the time course of alterations in expression of these epilepsy-associated factors, as well as the mTOR pathway, in relationship with spontaneous seizure development. We will also determine whether seizure induction during a ?pre-symptomatic? stage will cause accelerated AD neuropathology in these mice. Finally, we will use the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to perform a preclinical trial aimed at decreasing AD neuropathology associated with hyperexcitability and seizures in the 5XFAD mice. In Aim 1, we will use both human AD, TLE, and control cortical and hippocampal specimens to determine whether the expression of common biomarkers of epilepsy correlate with the severity of AD pathology and presence or absence of epilepsy. In Aim 2, these biomarkers of potential clinical interest will be then assessed in longitudinal studies using the validated 5XFAD mouse model, by monitoring the evolution of AD pathology, cognitive dysfunction, and spontaneous seizure activity at baseline (Aim 2a). Subsequently, in Aim 2b we will determine whether attenuating epileptogenesis with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin will improve AD neuropathology and cognition in the AD mice. In Aim 2c we will assess the direct effects of induced seizures on the previous outcomes, and determine whether rapamycin can prevent or reverse these changes. All studies will be statistically powered, will use formal randomization procedures, and primary data analysis will be conducted in a blinded manner. We anticipate that our proposed work will provide strong evidence for a causal link between hyperexcitability, mTOR activation and neurodegeneration in AD, specifically that seizures may represent a treatable component of AD. Further, we aim to build a research platform that will allow us to explore preclinical treatments trials in the future."
"9467569","ABSTRACT  Pediatric dysphagia, or difficulties with feeding and swallowing, is associated with many developmental  disorders; however, the underlying causes remain poorly characterized. Consequently, at present there are no  strategies to prevent feeding and swallowing defects. In this proposal, we will examine the potential of maternal  nutrition during pregnancy to prevent pediatric dysphagia in the LgDel mouse model of 22q11 deletion  syndrome (22q11DS). Our preliminary data suggest that pediatric dysphagia in newborn LgDel mice is due, at  least in part, to abnormal development of the hindbrain and cranial nerves (CNs). Furthermore, we show that  development of these structures in LgDel embryos is sensitive to exposure to the maternal dietary factor  vitamin A (VA) and its active metabolite retinoic acid (RA). Thus, we will test the hypothesis that altered  levels of vitamin A and other micronutrients in the maternal diet can prevent dysphagia by correcting  underlying abnormal hindbrain, CN, and/or craniofacial development. To test this hypothesis, we will  establish optimal protocols for modifying VA levels in the maternal diet to reduce the severity of pediatric  dysphagia, identify the targets of altered RA exposure resulting in reduced phenotypic severity, and elucidate  the molecular mechanisms that underlie this new prevention strategy. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the  relationship between maternal intake of VA and fetal RA levels. We will then ask if maternal exposures that are  benign for WT animals correct key feeding and swallowing phenotypes in dysphagic postnatal LgDel pups. In  Specific Aim 2, we will define the developmental mechanisms, including those discovered in PROJECT 2,  that are modulated by modified maternal VA intake. Thus we will better define the causal relationship between  developmental disruption and feeding and swallowing difficulties. In Specific Aim 3, we will investigate the  effect of maternal nutrition on the expression or activity of 2 22q11DS candidate genes: Ranpb1 and Tbx1. We  will characterize dysphagia-related phenotypes in Ranbp1 mutants, assess the interaction of this mutation with  Tbx1, and determine the effect of altered VA/RA exposure. Together these experiments will define how  developmental and molecular mechanisms underlying pediatric dysphagia during embryonic development can  be exploited to prevent the disorder. Most importantly, these studies will provide a foundation for using an  established strategy for optimal prenatal care?modified maternal nutrition?to prevent pediatric dysphagia in  at risk pregnancies."
"9495459","PROJECT SUMMARY Aging is the most significant negative regulator of hippocampal neurogenesis, contributing to impairments in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. The main goal of this application is to identify juvenile protective factors (JPFs) that are capable of maintaining neurogenesis and cognitive function in aged mice so that effective therapeutic strategies for age-related cognitive disorders can be realized. Towards identifying novel JPFs, we have recently provided first evidence that the mitotic checkpoint kinase BubR1 is required for maintaining proper early brain development and hippocampal function later in life. Specifically, BubR1 level is particularly high during early development and then declines to an adult level, followed by further decline during the natural aging process. Given that neurogenesis is robust in childhood, but undergoes a progressive decline with aging, such expression pattern of BubR1 correlates with age-dependent declines in neurogenesis. However, whether sustained BubR1 levels have a protective role in the aged brain, and thus suggest a novel JPF that maintains proper neurogenesis and related hippocampal function in aged mice, remains unknown. Therefore, the main objective of this application is to resolve whether sustained high level of BubR1 in aged brain prevents age-related hippocampal dysfunction. To support this idea, our preliminary data demonstrate that BubR1 insufficiency accelerates age-dependent impairments in hippocampal neurogenesis. Importantly, while a high level of BubR1 itself does not have any detrimental effects in young mice, it promotes neurogenesis in aged mice. Based on these findings, our central hypothesis is that reduced BubR1 levels with age contribute to age-dependent declines in hippocampal function, and that sustained high levels of BubR1 promote neurogenesis and improve synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in aged mice. Utilizing multiple approaches including mouse genetics, confocal imaging, electrophysiology, and behavior analysis, Aim 1 will determine a key downstream molecular pathway of BubR1 in regulating neurogenesis. Given the well- established role of Wnt signaling in neurogenesis and aging, we will explore the involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway in neurogenesis in both BubR1 insufficient and aged mice. Subsequently, Aim 2 will test whether a sustained high level of BubR1 can restore hippocampal neurogenesis in aged mice. Lastly, Aim 3 will determine if a sustained high level of BubR1 improves synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in aged mice in a neurogenesis-dependent manner. In summary, our findings will not only reveal the etiology of age- related cognitive disorders, but also provide a framework by which therapeutic interventions may target neurogenic declines during normal brain aging. Considering the prevalence of age-associated cognitive deficits, determining the mechanistic elements improving hippocampal function will hold significant implications for the fields of cognitive aging, neurogenesis, neural plasticity, regenerative medicine, and public health."
"9382267","Abstract Globally alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. ALD results from chronic inflammation and oxidative stress and hepatocyte death which releases a variety of cellular injury and damage associated molecules, apoptotic bodies, microvesicles (MV) and exosomes (EXOs) into the hepatic microenvironment activating other hepatic cell types. This chronic injury results in an exacerbated wound-healing response characterized by excess collagen deposition that can lead to fibrosis/cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Alcohol is hepatotoxic, but its metabolism drives oxidative stresses contributing to hepatic pathology. Multiple cell types in the liver are required to coordinate a response to this chronic injury. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) transdifferentiate from a quiescent to an activated myofibroblast-type cell that is the primary effector of collagen deposition. Hepatic macrophages, Kupffer cells (KC) regulate innate inflammatory responses and hepatic remodeling. Coordination of repair and remodeling requires intracellular communication. The intimate arrangement of these cells in hepatic microenvironment facilitates the transfer of exosomes (EXOs) between the cell populations. EXOs are vesicles of 30-100 nm that are produced by all active or resting cells and are packaged with microRNA (miR), mRNA and protein cargo. EXOs can be found in tissues, blood and other bodily fluids where they can functionally transfer their contents to recipient cells inducing changes in gene expression and activity. EXO-mediated transfer of miRs may exert local control on HSC activation and KC function during alcohol-induced injury. miRs, small non-coding RNAs, are critical regulators of gene expression that influence all cellular physiological functions, and they are a major component of EXO cargo. We have identified that EXO secretion is increased in activated HSCs, and that the miR profiles change on activation. In addition, EXOs from activated HSCs interact with macrophages to suppress the inflammatory immune response in cells exposed to bacterial endotoxin. Based on these data we hypothesize that EXOs secreted by HSCs during alcohol-induced liver injury deliver unique miR cargo that can modulate KC responses and coordinate tissue repair during hepatic injury. In aim 1 we will identify changes in miRs profiles from HSC- EXOs in models of alcohol-induced injury. In aim 2 we will identify membrane and internal protein and RNA (mRNA, miR, etc.) cargo from HSC-EXOs that may facilitate cellular uptake and define miR:mRNA interactions that may direct and coordinate KC function. Much remains unknown about the cellular exchange and role of EXOs in ALD pathology. The approach in this application is innovative as it will identify exosomal miRs from activated HSCs that serve to locally modulate KC function. In addition, using models of alcohol-induced hepatic injury with a novel method of extracting tissue specific exosomes we will more directly determine their role in hepatic pathology. We anticipate these studies will reveal novel diagnostic/prognostic indicators and identify new therapeutic targets."
"9636911","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimal immune responses to pathogens in barrier tissues require timely regulation of lymphocyte recruitment to lymphoid tissues and effector sites. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are cells of the lymphoid lineage and are enriched in mucosal tissues. They play important roles in fighting pathogens, inducing lymphoid tissue development and strengthening epithelial barrier function. ILCs are sub-divided into three major subsets with distinct effector cytokine phenotype: ILC1 produce the Th1 cytokine IFN-?, ILC2 produce Th2 cytokines, and ILC3 produce Th17 cytokines. A major problem in the field is our lack of understanding of the migration program of ILC subsets. While ILCs are enriched in barrier tissues and distributed in a tissue-specific manner, we currently don't understand how ILCs migrate to these tissues for development and effector function. Our preliminary data raised the possibility that ILCs have highly sophisticated migration programs that support their development and effector function. Particularly, the data suggest that certain homing receptors regulate tissue-specific population, migration, and function of ILC subsets. We hypothesize that ILC subsets undergo potentially distinct homing receptor switches to migrate from the generative sites to lymphoid tissues and then to effector sites. Moreover, these homing receptor switches are likely to be regulated at multiple stages of ILC development in the bone marrow and periphery by cytokines and tissue factors. To test the hypothesis and obtain detailed information regarding ILC migration, we devised the following three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the shared and differential migration programs of ILC subsets. Aim 2. Determine the roles of HRs in ILC migration and tissue tropism. Aim 3. Determine the impact of HRs on effector functions of ILC subsets. The project will generate fundamental knowledge on ILC migration and distribution in the body with a special emphasis on ILC subset-specific trafficking. Homing receptors important for ILC effector function and the factors that regulate the expression of these receptors will be identified. The outcomes will provide novel insights into the establishment of ILC immunity in barrier tissues."
"9532703","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By 2020, 70% of people living with HIV in the United States will be ?50 years of age due, in large part, to improved clinical care, more efficacious antiretroviral therapy regimens, and the increasing number of persons newly diagnosed with HIV ?50 years of age. An estimated 37% of sexually active older people living with HIV (OPLWH) continue to engage in HIV transmission sexual behaviors. In spite of repeated calls for secondary prevention interventions to reduce condomless sex in OPLWH, no age-appropriate, evidence-based secondary prevention interventions exist for this group. Many OPLWH cannot engage in face-to-face secondary prevention services because of HIV- and age-related stigma, comorbid mental and physical health conditions that complicate travel to venues in which HIV prevention interventions are delivered, or geographic isolation. High rates of depression and neurocognitive impairment in OPLWH may further complicate engagement in, and reduce benefits of, interventions that aim to reduce HIV transmissions in this group. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of a 5-session telephone-administered motivational interviewing plus behavioral skills training (teleMI+BST) intervention to reduce condomless sex in HIV-positive adults 50-plus years of age. A geographically and ethnically/racially diverse sample of 336 OPLWH will be recruited across the U.S. through community-based organizations that serve people living with HIV, rural networks of HIV social service providers, advertisements placed in HIV-related magazines and websites, and online dating forums. Eligible persons will be randomly assigned to receive either a 5-session teleMI+BST intervention or an attention equivalent 5-session telephone-administered coping effectiveness training (teleCET) control intervention. Study therapists will be community-based HIV social service providers located in Portland, OR. Self- administered questionnaires will assess demographic characteristics, and condom use knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and skills, while a brief telephone interview will assess sexual behavior, substance use, and psychiatric symptoms. A telephone-administered neurocognitive assessment will also be conducted at baseline. Study Aim 1 will test the efficacy of teleMI+BST to reduce occasions of non-condom protected anal and vaginal intercourse with HIV-negative or unknown HIV serostatus partners and examine psychosocial mediators of intervention efficacy. Study Aim 2 will test the efficacy of teleMI+BST to reduce depressive symptoms in mildly depressed participants. Study Aim 3 will test the moderating effect of baseline depressive symptom severity on teleMI+BST efficacy. Additional exploratory analyses will examine the impact of neurocognitive functioning, VL, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use by participants' sexual partners on teleMI+BST efficacy. This study may yield an evidence-based, person-centered intervention that meets the unique sexual relationship and health needs of OPLWH and reduces the transmission of HIV to their HIV- negative sexual partners."

"9526682","Project Summary: The capability to manipulate pancreatic function through peripheral nerve stimulation offers exciting therapeutic potential, but will require a deeper understanding of underlying molecular biology as well as inter-organ signaling and communication. Such processes are difficult to study in vivo because they occur on time-scales of seconds to minutes?far faster than can be measured by conventional assays. The primary goal of this project is to develop real-time in vivo biosensors that can continuously measure the physiological concentrations of glucose, insulin and glucagon in specific areas of the pancreas of freely moving animals. Our biosensors will detect these three biomarkers with high sensitivity (pM~nM), spatial resolution (~10 ?m) and temporal resolution (~1 minute), and thereby offer unprecedented insights into the molecular biology of the pancreas. We will be building upon aptamer biosensor technology previously developed by our group, with which we have already demonstrated the first continuous measurement of small molecule drugs in vivo as well as closed-loop feedback control in live animals. This is a ?platform? technology that can be readily adapted to measure a wide range of biomarkers by swapping the aptamer probes, as we have demonstrated previously. Upon successful development of this real-time biosensor for the pancreas, we will expand the range of targets to 20 other biomarkers, including neuromodulators and cytokines that play important roles in peripheral nerve stimulation. To make these biosensor systems available to other researchers, a startup company (RT Biotech) will refine the prototypes and produce them at low volumes for other groups within the SPARC program within 3 years."
"9493697","ABSTRACT  In order to meet the investigative needs of the Dartmouth research community in genomics, a request of $175,000 is submitted as part of a proposal to purchase a Chromium instrument from 10X Genomics, Inc. (Pleasanton, CA) to carry out single-cell sequencing. The sequencer will be placed in the Dartmouth Genomics & Molecular Biology Shared Resource (GMBSR), a core facility (1500 sq ft) in the Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) at the Geisel Medical School at Dartmouth with the expertise, knowledge, and experience to maximize the scientific potential of the new technology. The Chromium system would provide users with the latest and most advanced high-throughput sequencing technology available for single cell genomics. The need for single cell sequencing is based on several factors. Foremost, the provision of this new technology will allow Dartmouth investigators to probe questions in cancer biology, immunology, and other disciplines in ways not possible with the current technology at Dartmouth, including questions regarding the high degree of cell-to-cell variability in cancer progression and resistance to therapy, the immune response, and chronobiology. A user group of Dartmouth PIs has been identified of which seven major users and several minor users are projected to use the new technology immediately, with additional users predicted in the near and sustainable future. The major and minor user groups possess 11 NIH grants totaling approximately $4.34 million in annual direct costs. The single cell sequencing would be secured in an existing pipeline consisting of the (i) Immune Monitoring and Flow Cytometry Shared Resource to advise, assist, and/or carry out the labeling, isolation, and verification of single cell preparations; (ii) the above described GMBSR to carry out the single cell library construction and deep sequencing; and (iii) Bioinformatics resources to advise, assist, and/or carry out the analyses. The personnel, expertise, and resources to successfully operate and sustain single cell sequencing are already in place. The pipeline currently operates under the auspices and support of the NCCC with additional support from the Geisel Medical School at Dartmouth and Dartmouth College. Administration and scientific issues regarding the technology will be overseen by the Integrative Biology (Advisory) Committee. Operating costs will for the most part be met by subsidies from an NCI Cancer Center grant to the NCCC and fee-for-service charges to the investigator. In conclusion, the investigators, research questions, infrastructure, and cross-institutional and -departmental support are in place to implement single cell sequencing to greatly advance genomics studies and knowledge at Dartmouth."
"9497518","Project Summary/Abstract:  Optogenetic methods for modulating neural activity are revolutionizing neurobiological research. Brief exposure to light of cells expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) can elicit excitatory cation fluxes (or inhibitory ion fluxes with the halorhodopsin NpHR). The consequences of optogenetic stimulation would optimally be recorded by non-invasive optical methods. However, most current optical methods for monitoring neural activity are based on fluorescence excitation that can cause unwanted stimulation of the optogenetic probe and other undesirable effects such as tissue autofluorescence. Luminescence is an alternate optical technology that avoids the problems associated with fluorescence. A novel luminescence-based methodology for monitoring neural activity as a new tool for functional neuroscience will be developed in this project.  Luminescence avoids the complications associated with fluorescence because it is an enzymatic reaction that circumvents the need for excitation. The newly developed luminescence sensors for neuronal activity are genetically encodable and can be targeted to specific cell types and to specific cellular loci that are involved in neural activity. These sensors respond to the calcium ion fluxes generated by neuronal activity by changing the intensity and/or spectrum of their luminescence emission. In the latter case, a novel sensor based on Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) is modulated by neural activity so that the spectrum of luminescent emission is altered when neurons are activated. This new luminescence methodology avoids the drawbacks of electrophysiology and fluorescence excitation (esp. off-target optogenetic stimulation, photobleaching & tissue autofluorescence), and therefore optimally partners with optogenetic methods for in vitro and in vivo stimulation.  These luminescence sensors will be characterized in conjunction with optogenetic stimulation of neuronal activity in vitro, especially while actuating both ChR2 (excited by blue light) and NpHR (excited by orange light) in the same experiment to control positive and negative ion fluxes into cells. In addition, the luminescence sensors will be applied to high-throughput screening of autofluorescent neuroactive compounds. In addition to these in vitro applications, however, the primary goal of this project is to apply these novel sensors for the first time to several new in vivo applications of measuring neural activity in a minimally invasive manner in freely behaving rodents.  This project is appropriate for the R21 Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant mechanism of the NIMH because it will develop new technologies and tools to advance spatiotemporal analyses of complex circuits and cellular interactions in the brains of multiple model animal species."
"9473656","PROJECT SUMMARY  Ischemic heart disease accounts for approximately 42.5% of all cardiovascular-related deaths and afflicts 720,000 individuals/year. While current medical treatments have significantly decreased heart attack- associated mortality, post-ischemic myocardial tissue undergoes pathologic remodeling and scarring, subjecting patients to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. As endogenous cardiac regeneration is limited, stem cell and regenerative medicine-based approaches to cardiac repair represent promising solutions towards regaining normal heart function. Bolstering interest in cardiovascular tissue engineering has given rise to the development of novel biomaterials capable of maintaining cardiac cell function within a 3D tissue-like environment, while detailed protocols have been developed to derive mature cardiomyocytes from a myriad of stem cell sources; however, the essential ability to generate a construct that recapitulates the cellular density and composition, thickness, and helicoid structure of the native heart has limited the therapeutic applicability of tissue engineered constructs thus far. Utilizing photodegradable polymer-based hydrogels that enable a spatially-defined co-culture of hES-derived cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, we propose to generate a densely-vascularized 3D cardiac construct exhibiting biomimetic helical tissue architecture. To support the culture of a thick myocardial tissue and enhance mass transport of oxygen and nutrients, vessels will be photopatterned into cell-laden hydrogels containing mature cardiomyocytes to generate perfusable vasculature with similar size, shape, and structure to that of the native heart. Channels will be endothelialized and perfused with fresh media using biomimetic pulsatile flow to encourage endothelial-cardiomyocyte cell interaction. We aim to demonstrate that by controlling micron-scale channel architecture in a biomimetic helical arrangement with near-native heart capillary density, paracrine signaling, ECM deposition, and direct contact of endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, we can direct cardiomyocyte orientation, enhance construct contractility, and recapitulate the native torsional tissue contraction. As the proposed research will represent the first successful strategy to generate perfusable vasculature networks with 3D features on the single-micron scale, we expect that the developed methodologies will find wide applicability in the engineering of vascularized constructs beyond cardiac tissue."
"9468236","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Classifying cancers based on molecular signatures, as opposed to tissue of origin, has allowed for the development of molecularly targeted therapeutics which maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity for each patient. The vast majority of these therapies are inhibitors of oncogenic kinases, thus limiting the potential application of these therapies to specific cancer subtypes. Given their mechanism of action, resistance to kinase based therapies almost inevitably develops. Alternatively, the therapeutic potential of activating endogenous tumor suppressors has not been thoroughly explored. Unlike oncogene based therapies, re- activation of tumor suppressors holds the potential to target multiple molecular drivers, enhancing the applicability of such a therapy. One major class of tumor suppressor enzymes, Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is functionally inactivated in the majority of human cancers, rendering it a potential therapeutic target. The complex heterotrimeric structure of PP2A, consisting of an obligate scaffold and enzymatic subunit coupled to one of four classes of regulatory subunits, allows for broad substrate specificity and tumor suppressive functions. PP2A inactivation occurs through several mechanisms including increased expression of endogenous inhibitors, epigenetic silencing, and post-translational modifications to various subunits. Our lab has engineered a novel class of small molecule activators of PP2A (SMAPs) which direct conformational changes on the core dimer, re-activating PP2A, resulting in pre-clinical efficacy in xenograft, patient derived, and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer. Our preliminary studies have identified SMAP induced alterations to key regulators of PP2A, including the PP2A inhibitor, PME-1, an oncogenic methyl-esterase. Importantly, PME-1 is overexpressed in an array of human cancers, and has been shown to directly enhance tumorigenesis in cellular systems. Select cancer derived mutations in the scaffold subunit of PP2A demonstrate resistance to SMAP therapy, while demonstrating enhanced binding to PME-1. We seek to outline the mechanism by which PME-1 abrogates the tumor suppressive functions of PP2A as well as the mechanism by which SMAPs regulate PP2A:PME-1 complex formation to promote tumor suppression. This knowledge will provide critical insight into key regulatory elements responsible for directing PP2A substrate specificity and overall function. Understanding the SMAP induced mechanism of tumor suppression will lay the foundation for the development of next generation compounds."
"9558708","Glycoprotein Immunoassay to Measure Protective Humoral Responses to Lassa Vaccine This project will complete the pre-clinical development of a Lassa virus (LASV) glycoprotein immunoassay to measure the protective response to Lassa fever (LF) vaccines. LF causes endemic febrile illness throughout West Africa and can quickly progress to viral hemorrhagic fever with mortality rates greater than 50% in high risk groups. LASV is transmitted to humans through exposure to the excreta of its rodent host or direct contact with bodily fluids of an active LF case. The West African population and non-indigenous groups such as deployed US military are at increased risk of zoonotic LF transmission. This companion diagnostic will fill the unmet need for a standardized assay to measure the humoral response to Lassa virus infection in humans and non-human primates and prescreen study candidates and monitor their response to Lassa virus glycoprotein based vaccines now under development. The enzyme labeled immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format test will incorporate highly specific reagents recently developed to advance Lassa fever therapeutics and vaccines. Our proprietary ELISA plate coating will specifically absorb and stabilize trimeric LASV glycoprotein developed at the Scripps Research Institute. This recombinant glycoprotein has been specially engineered to replicate the neutralizing and non- neutralizing epitopes of LASV currently causing Lassa fever outbreak in West Africa. Identification of these epitopes was completed through the use of recombinant human monoclonal antibodies (HuMabs) derived by researchers at Tulane University and Zalgen Labs from B cells donated by Lassa fever survivors in West Africa. Several of these HuMabs have been combined into the therapeutic Arenviramab-3 (Zalgen Labs) and recently shown to completely protect NHPs from fatal inoculations of LASV. The proposed glycoprotein ELISA test will include these HuMabs as reference standard to accurately measure the level of human (and NHP) antibody response to LASV vaccine. The first aim of this project will be to complete design optimization of the Lassa GPC Antibody ELISA test including freeze-dried reference standards, controls, and kit packaging for eventual deployment to West African clinical sites. The second aim of the program will completion of pilot stage kit manufacturing and design validation analytical performance testing. The third aim will be verification of sensitivity and specificity estimates by testing both non-human primate and de-identified human diagnostic samples from biorepositories in both Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Our ultimately goal is a regulatory approved product to support Lassa fever therapeutic and vaccine development studies and assist in the deployment of these lifesaving interventions throughout West Africa and to other at risk groups."
"9480961","Project Summary Abstract Our proposal will address the impact of cocaine on exosome-mediate HIV-1 entry of the central nervous system (CNS) resident cells. Multiple studies have shown that HIV-1 patients may develop virus reservoirs that impede eradication; these reservoirs include cells found in the CNS. Many substances of abuse have been shown to increase HIV-1 Infection. HIV-infected, drug- abusing individuals may experience more severe or faster-progressing HIV-1 related neurological impairment. Some of the main mechanisms have shown that with drugs of abuse there is increased oxidative stress and increased permeability seen in the blood brain barrier (BBB). Exosomes can act as potential facilitators of HIV-1 infection in the CNS. CD4+/CCR5+ cells are the predominant target cells of HIV-1 infection. However, since evidence exists for HIV-1 infection of CD4-lacking astrocytes, these cells could have a potential role as HIV-1 reservoirs. Thus, alternative HIV-1 entry and infection mechanisms likely exist for CNS resident cells, but to date, limited information on this topic exist. Exosomes crossing the BBB, or being released from cells within the CNS (including HIV-1 infected cells of the monocytic lineage) may be an important link to alternative HIV-1 infection pathways in the CNS. Our approach will allow evaluation of exosome-mediated HIV-1 entry into CNS cells as well as immune cells within this site (in vitro). Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that exosome- mediated mechanisms significantly facilitate HIV-1 entry in the CNS, and that cocaine can augment this process of infection. These processes will be evaluated and provide a basis for new and effective therapeutics."

This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Bayesian adaptive, Phase III comparative effectiveness trial. Up to 795 patients will be randomized initially 1:1:1 and response-adaptive randomization will occur after 300 patients have been recruited. Randomization will be stratified by three age groups, 2-18, 19-65, and 66 years and older. The primary outcome measure is cessation of clinical seizure activity and improving mental status, without serious adverse effects or further intervention at 60 min after administration of study drug. Each subject will be followed until discharge or 30 days from enrollment. This trial will include interim analyses for early success and futility. This trial wil be considered a success if the probability that a treatment is the most effective is greater than 0.975 or the probability that a treatment is the least effective is greater than 0.975 for any treatment. This will be the first phase III clinical trial of ESE in children and adults."
"9467564","ABSTRACT  The three PROJECTS in this Program will integrate transcriptional networks with cellular, molecular,  electrophysiological, and physiological mechanisms that underlie dysphagia in mouse models of 22q11  Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS). CORE C, the Genomics and Bioinformatics Core, will generate high-quality  cDNA libraries and RNA-Seq reads from RNA isolated from specific brain regions and nuclei, known to be  important for feeding and swallowing, using specimens isolated from mouse genetic models of 22q11DS. The  resulting RNA-Seq pair-end reads will be processed by our bioinformatics pipeline to generate the following  genomics resources: i) assembly of reads into transcripts and alternatively spliced transcripts; ii) assembly of  non-coding RNAs; iii) differential expression analysis; and iv) gene network and pathway over-representation  analysis. These genomics resources serve two major roles. First, this information will serve to validate or  invalidate hypotheses being tested in the Program PROJECTS. Second, we anticipate that our bioinformatics  approach will generate new foundations, not envisioned or anticipated a priori at the Program's outset, for  additional hypothesis testing at the molecular, physiological, and pharmacological (e.g., drug targeting of  pathways to ameliorate disrupted feeding behavior) levels. Moreover, the genomics resources generated by  CORE C will be deposited into a central repository (e.g., Sequence Read Archive of NCBI) for Data Sharing  with other investigational groups, allowing them to mine our data and generate their own testable hypotheses.  NARRATIVE  CORE C will process and assess RNA-Seq transcriptome data for all 3 PROJECTS using an integrated  computational pipeline. We will facilitate testing specific hypotheses defined in PROJECTS 1 and 2, as well as  generate hypotheses that provide a framework for further analysis of molecular, cellular, and physiological  mechanisms that underlie pediatric dysphagia (PROJECT 1), its developmental origin (PROJECT 2), or  prevention (PROJECT 3). Our computational approach is anticipated to identify new diagnostic signatures or  high priority pharmacologically accessible targets for intervention testing in animal models."
"9509199","Project summary/Abstract  Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia found in the elderly and disease progression has been strongly associated with accumulation of Amyloid beta 1-42 (A?42) in brain. An immune-mediated approach as a preventive intervention to reduce amyloid plaques without causing brain inflammation is highly desirable for future clinical use. Genetic immunization, in which the immunizing agent is DNA encoding A?42, has great potential because the immune response to DNA is generally non-inflammatory, and differs quantitatively and qualitatively from the immune response elicited by peptides, which is mainly inflammatory.  DNA immunization has historically been proven difficult to apply to larger mammals. A potential barrier to use DNA immunization in large mammals is the method for delivery of the DNA antigen. Over the last decade, substantial progress has been made to increase the effectiveness of DNA delivery and immune responses, respectively. Electroporation had been shown to greatly enhance DNA immunogenicity in clinical trials, and DNA electroporation has been reported as highly tolerable by the patients with few side effects. This proposal is aimed at translating our established gene gun DNA A?42 delivery immunization approach in mice into the clinically more feasible method of needle-free intradermal DNA delivery via jet injection possibly in combination with electroporation to trigger DNA uptake and immune responses. We will use wild-type mice and New Zealand White rabbits as a large mammal model to test our DNA A?42 delivery methods, and to demonstrate antibody production and safe immune responses. We will use the 3xTg-AD mouse model to demonstrate that DNA A?42 immunization using jet injection and/or electroporation is effective to break tolerance against self-antigens, leading to the production of sufficient anti-A?42 antibody levels to clear A?42 and prevent amyloid accumulation in the brain without causing inflammatory side effects. This study is designed to optimize the DNA delivery for possible testing in human trials."
"9540581","ABSTRACT There is much evidence that the hemoglobin released after erythrocyte lysis is a cause of brain injury after cerebral hemorrhage. This may be related to hemoglobin or its degradation products (e.g. iron). How to reduce such injury is important considering there are no current clinically proven therapies for intracerebral hemorrhage. One mechanism that is involved in limiting hemoglobin toxicity systemically is CD163, a hemoglobin scavenger receptor, which is involved in the cellular uptake of hemoglobin when bound to haptoglobin. However, in cerebral hemorrhage, our recent results, supported by others, indicates that some hemoglobin is released before CD163 and other defense mechanisms are upregulated in brain (early erythrolysis). In addition, while microglial CD163 may be beneficial in scavenging hemoglobin, CD163 is also upregulated in neurons and is involved in inducing cell death. The aims of this proposal are, therefore: 1) Determine the mechanisms by which early hemoglobin release from cerebral hematomas occurs and can be reduced. 2) Examine whether CD163 is a therapeutic target in intracerebral hemorrhage. 3) Determine the mechanisms regulating CD163 in microglia and neurons in order to potentially manipulate those levels independently. These experiments will involve in vivo and in vitro models of intracerebral hemorrhage in rats, mice and pig already established in our laboratories."
"9503502","The primary goal of this proposal is to elucidate the possible mechanistic basis of emotional disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder, after mild traumatic brain injury.  Problem: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in military Veterans and often causes chronic suffering including damaging social relationships, employment prospects, health, and overall happiness of those who experience it. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a frequent preceding injury and the relationship between injury characteristics associated with mTBI and emotional dysregulation disorders such as PTSD remains unclear, with mixed findings reported in the literature. mTBI can damage important connections between brain regions, especially brain regions critical for emotional experience. Veterans who have suffered one or more mTBIs also are more likely to have other psychiatric conditions, and they also have worse health and social outcomes. Many of these poor outcomes are due to emotional dysregulation.  Individuals who have suffered a mTBI or who have PTSD often show changes in brain function in emotional and executive brain regions. Even when their performance on executive tasks is still normal, the underlying brain regions show altered functional relationships including increased activity. Interpretation of these functional changes presents challenges, however. In other populations, these sorts of findings are often associated with pathology or are leading indicators of functional decline. Further, such activity may reflect differences in the capacity to adaptively manage cognitive and emotional resources. When performing emotional tasks, individuals with PTSD show increased activity in emotional brain regions. This may be due in part to reduced executive capacity or to increased demands placed on executive capacity by an overactive emotional system, possibly mediated by dysfunctional neurotransmitter systems. Notably, PTSD is associated with a reduction in the receptors of and the levels of the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. Similarly, GABA is reduced after a TBI and this change is associated with a reduced ability to forget fearful memories and to regulate emotions. This overlap in brain changes may suggest a linkage between injury characteristics associated with mTBI and the development of PTSD.  Preliminary Work: Consistent with our theoretical model, our pilot data demonstrate damage in limbic and prefrontal connectivity is related to symptoms of PTSD in patients with mTBI. Further, we showed that injury characteristics of mTBI affect performance on emotional tasks. Finally, we demonstrated feasibility for each of the magnetic resonance measures and tasks that we will use in the proposed research.  Plan: The proposed investigation will examine the relationship between two key brain networks, limbic (emotional) and prefrontal, which are dysfunctional in individuals with emotional dysregulation and the function of which may be altered after a mTBI. The proposed investigation is also designed to evaluate how GABA mediates these alterations. To test these relationships and changes, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure regional task-dependent brain activity and regional GABA levels in combat Veterans. We will measure these factors during emotion and cognitive tasks previously reported to be altered in patients with PTSD. We predict that the pattern of activity in executive and emotional brain regions will show changes in activity that relate to PTSD symptoms and to GABA levels. These relationships have not been reported in the literature. If there is a linkage between functional connectivity after mTBI, PTSD and regional GABA levels, there may be potential personalized treatment options that could be harnessed to enact positive changes in these systems and alleviate suffering."

Quarles, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, The Optical Society  2010 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, DC  gquarles@osa.org, 202-416-1954 Project Summary /Abstract:  The 2018 OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics, 3-6 April 2018, Hollywood, FL, consists of four topical meetings. Within this congress, the Optics and the Brain Conference is specifically focused on cutting-edge research and innovative new tools and techniques that seek to increase fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students, early career professionals, and underrepresented speakers that will present on optics and the brain topics within this meeting.  The 2018 OSA Optics and the Brain conference was founded in 2015 in response to the USA BRAIN Initiative and the European Human Brain Project. These initiatives have identified the urgent need for new technologies that can probe the working brain across all levels from single neurons to entire behaving organisms. Optics offers a unique toolkit for multiscale imaging the living and intact brain, while new genetic labeling strategies provide optical contrast to neural function and optogenetics permits the control of cellular function with light. Optics and the Brain is thus an important, highly interdisciplinary area of research that combines broad aspects of neuroscience, biology, medicine, physics, chemistry and engineering. This year the program is adding more topics to be able to better explore new tools, the use of artificial intelligence in machine learning and technologies that will allow doctors to explore larger, deeper sections of the brain.  The general purpose of this congress with co-located meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events.

"9559033","Project Summary/Abstract Miami has emerged as the US epicenter of the now-global Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic. The consequences of infection remain to be fully elucidated, but the probable link between ZIKV infection and fetal developmental complications raises enormous concern as to the potential impact of ZIKV. Current emergency use authorization (EUA) commercial assays detect ZIKV RNA, the presence of ZIKV-specific IgM, and utilize the laborious Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) to detect previous exposure to ZIKV. PRNT assay results took as long as 10 weeks to report back to the patient during the 2016 outbreak in Miami and can be equivocal for ZIKV exposure when patients have had a history of dengue virus (DENV). DENV is of considerable concern, because it infects approximately 200 million people a year, is spread by the same mosquito vector as ZIKV, and causes symptoms similar to ZIKV. This serological cross-reactivity between ZIKV and DENV is currently causing significant problems in the ZIKV diagnostic field. Accordingly, our plan is to develop a highly-specific diagnostic test for the detection of previous exposure to ZIKV. Fortunately, we are in a unique position to rapidly develop this diagnostic. · We have isolated anti-ZIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from human volunteers that only recognize  ZIKV and none of the four DENV serotypes. We have used one of these mAbs in a plasma competition assay to determine previous exposure to ZIKV. · We have developed a rapid and innovative assay to detect previous flavivirus exposure that can  discriminate between ZIKV and DENV with extraordinary specificity. In the current Phase I proposal, we will 1) advance our preliminary research results to create a clinical ZIKV diagnostic assay for serological reactivity in the convalescent phase, 2) test our innovative diagnostic assay on well-defined, complex human clinical samples, and 3) develop a novel ZIKV diagnostic test to distinguish between recent and older ZIKV infections.  "
"9568891","The proposal requests Nikon's A1R+ confocal laser microscope as a common resource shared major equipment integral to the core lab facility to be used by biomedical researchers of the James A Haley Veterans Hospital (JAHVH). Biomedical research at JAHVH is conducted by renowned, well-funded investigators. The proposed instrument will be predominantly used by 14 investigators, including 2 Senior Research Career Scientists and 2 Research Career Scientists with ongoing research programs related to Alzheimer's Disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, Gulf War Illness, respiratory syncytial disease, traumatic brain injury and regenerative medicine. In addition, these individuals have other grants (NIH, AHA, FLDOH, DoD, etc.) that will utilize the confocal microscope to help build on existing and new research projects that will benefit Veterans.  This acquisition will be a much-needed replacement for the greater than 15-year-old defunct microscope presently available for use. No other confocal microscopes are available within JAHVH and the one available at the University of South Florida (USF, our affiliate university) is in high-demand within USF, shared by 5 colleges and often time-slots are unavailable as VA researchers are not given preference over USF researchers. Additionally, transportation to USF causes delays adversely affecting samples.  The confocal microscope captures images at a higher resolution with high sensitivity compared to conventional microscope. Other benefits of confocal microscope include enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, comprehensible and close examination of thick samples, Z-axis scanning and depth perception in Z-sectioned images and electronically adjusted magnification. High quality images are the crux of research projects and are central to publications in high impact journals and obtaining federal funding.  Nikon's A1R+ confocal microscopy system has a hybrid scan head that incorporates both an ultrahigh-speed resonant scanner and a high-resolution galvano scanner. The Ti2 inverted microscope platform features a minimum 25mm field of view (FOV) ? the largest FOV available on any microscope currently on the market. Ti2 with the A1R confocal scan head, can perform additional features like Super Resolution, TIRF and fast wide-field multi-channel imaging, all of which is controlled through NIS- Elements, its imaging software. The A1R+ confocal has a unique auto-correction collar available for high magnification super-resolution imaging. Stage top incubator TIZW series Neco incubation system provides real-time live imaging for uptake, trafficking, FRET imaging, RNA-protein interactions.  Overall, the proposed instrument will significantly impact and augment VAMC's mission to advance the healthcare of Veterans by allowing VA researchers to conduct cutting-edge research in basic, translational or clinical fields. These endeavors will substantially contribute to the long-term research goals of the JAHVH."
"9510349","Project Summary Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infections cause a variety of diseases in humans, ranging from cold sores to blinding ocular infections and life-threatening encephalitis. The virus has two distinct phases of its life cycle: lytic and latent infections. Lytic infection occurs in fibroblasts and epithelial cells and some types of neurons. Latent infection, which only occurs in neurons, represses overall gene expression with no infectious virus produced. Infected cell protein 0 (ICP0), expressed by HSV-1 during lytic infection, plays a pivotal role in the switch between lytic and latent infections. ICP0 is required for efficient viral replication, strongly stimulating viral transcription via its E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase activity. E3 Ub ligases facilitate the attachment and polymerization of the post-translational modification, Ub, to target proteins, marking them for degradation by the proteasome. Recent studies suggest that ICP0 directs ubiquitination of selected host cell proteins that restrict viral gene expression in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, thus leading to robust lytic infection. In neurons, however, where neuronal proteins restrict viral gene expression to drive the establishment of latency, the targets of ICP0-mediated ubiquitination and degradation are unknown. Efforts to identify ICP0-specific targets have been challenging given the limitations in the purity and detection of proteins via traditional methods. The unknown identity of the full repertoire of cellular proteins targeted for ICP0 ubiquitination and degradation represents a critical barrier to understanding its function, since these target proteins have the potential to restrict lytic infection. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how virus-host interactions regulate the HSV replication cycle. The objective of this application is to use an advanced proteomics approach to answer the question: Which unique neuronal factors does ICP0 ubiquitinate and degrade to lift the restriction on viral gene expression and replication? To address this question, we will use a method to enrich for ubiquitinated proteins, followed by tandem mass spectrometry (TMS) to identify novel targets of ICP0 ubiquitination. The rationale for carrying out these experiments is that by understanding how ICP0 contributes to lytic infection in neurons, it may be possible to develop anti-HSV therapies. To accomplish this objective, the proposal brings together two investigators with distinct and synergistic expertise: Dr. Bertke (neurovirology) and Dr. Davido (HSV-1 ICP0 function). With this background the following Specific Aims are proposed: Aim #1: Identify new cellular targets that are ubiquitinated by HSV-1 ICP0 in primary adult neurons. Aim #2: Determine the role of novel and candidate cellular targets of ICP0-mediated ubiquitination in neuronal infection. This proposal will contribute to identifying new cellular proteins involved in the biology of ICP0 using an innovative approach, which can be applied to isolate proteins and pathways that play important roles in viral infections and protein stability in neurons."
"9510624","Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) is an idiopathic, chronic autoimmune cholestatic disease characterized by female predominance, circulating antimitochondrial antibodies, non- suppurative small bile duct cholangitis, and progressive cholestasis which can result in end- stage liver disease if not recognized and treated. Despite strong evidence of immunologic involvement, the precise autoimmune initiating pathways remain unclear. Furthermore, while bile acid modulators have been able to impact disease management, immunomodulating therapies have proven unsuccessful to date. Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates the host response to infection and stress by activating key innate and adaptive immune pathways. MIF's bioactivity and MIF polymorphisms have been implicated in multiple autoimmune disorders. The applicant initiated the first investigation of MIF in autoimmune liver diseases and current research under a K08 has focused on the role of MIF and its receptor CD74 in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Novel preliminary data suggests that MIF may also be critical for antigen-specific cholangitis caused by T-cells. Furthermore, preliminary data from the recently described ARE-Del (-/-) model of autoimmune cholangitis, which closely mimics many features of PBC and is induced by chronic overexpression of IFN?, demonstrated significant overexpression of both CD74 and MIF. These data suggest a potential key role of MIF-CD74 in mediating autoimmune cholestasis. Therefore, the hypotheses of this project are that the immune-based pathogenesis of PBC critically depends on T-cell and hepatic MIF and CD74 expression, and that modulation of the MIF-CD74 cellular pathway prevents development and attenuates the progression of injury. To experimentally test this, Aim 1 will define the role of T-cell MIF expression in the OVA BIL mouse model of cholangitis, and test the ability of a novel small molecule MIF antagonist (MIF098) to prevent biliary injury. Aim 2 will define the role of MIF and CD74 in the ARE-Del (-/-) mouse by generating a novel ARE-Del (-/-)/CD74 KO mouse and by also using a pharmacotherapeutic approach with MIF098. The proposed experiments are expected to demonstrate that MIF and CD74 are critically important in autoimmune cholangitis and that pharmacotherapy with anti-MIF immunomodulation is effective in pre-clinical PBC models."
"9493712","Project Summary  Funding is requested for an electronics upgrade to our 11.7 tesla nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer for solutions applications at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Our current 11.7 T NMR is very heavily used and currently supports 24 NIH-funded projects from 8 NIH institutes. The existing spectrometer was purchased 10 years ago with a shared instrumentation grant and has been extensively used to support a wide range of NIH-funded research as evidenced by over 70 papers in PubMed that acknowledge the original shared instrumentation grant. However the the current instrument is increasingly unreliable and is not well supported by the manufacturer any longer. The proposed upgrade will replace the aging electronics with a state of the art three channel console, two probes, an autosampler, and a variable temperature system. This new instrument will be a crucial component in facilitating the development and synthesis of novel molecular imaging probes and contrast agents.  The dual mission of the Martinos Center is technology development and translational research involving advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, optical imaging, and magnetoencephalography. Analytical and physical chemistry underpins much of this work. For instance in molecular imaging probe development, NMR is vital for identification of key synthetic intermediates and for proof of structure the final compound. It is also a key method to determine compound purity. NMR is routinely used to characterize the biophysical properties of contrast agents, e.g. water and proton exchange kinetics, solution dynamics, and protein binding interactions. NMR is also used to monitor chemical kinetics. Finally, NMR is a quantitative technique that is routinely used to accurately determine concentrations.  The requested instrumentation will be administered as a shared resource for the Martinos center, the larger MGH research community, as well as other institutions in the greater Boston area. The Principle Investigator and Advisory Committee will ensure both equitable and cost-effective operation of this system. The electronics upgrade to this 11.7T NMR will greatly benefit our research community and we expect it will play an essential role in driving many new discoveries pertaining to a host of medically related issues including cancer, diabetes, drug addiction, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, liver disease, stroke, kidney disease, and neural plasticity."

"9502717","Deafness is a major health problem. A major cause of deafness is defects in hair cells, the mechanosensory cells of the cochlea that convert sound induced vibrations into electrical signals to provide our sense of hearing. Mutations in the genes encoding protocadherin (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23) cause hearing loss. Both genes are expressed in the hair bundles of the mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear where they form heterophilic adhesion complexes that are important for hair bundle morphogenesis and mechanotransduction. Significantly, different mutation in both PCDH15 and CDH23 lead to different disease outcomes. While some mutations cause profound congenital deafness with retinal impairment (Usher Syndrome) others lead to recessive and progressive hearing loss without visual involvement. Gene-association studies also suggest a link of CDH23 polymorphisms with age- and noise-induce hearing loss. The mechanisms by which different mutations lead to distinct disease outcomes are poorly defined. We propose here to combine high-resolution structural studies with functional studies in hair cells to gain insights into the mechanisms by which PCDH15 and CDH23 regulate hair cell function and to define disease mechanisms. To achieve this goal, a laboratory with expertise in studying the biophysical and structural properties of cadherins and a laboratory dedicated to the study of auditory neuroscience have combined their efforts to achieve what either could not accomplish alone. Unlike previous studies that have focused on structural analysis of small monomeric fragments of CDH23 and PCDH15 expressed in bacteria, the team proposed to define the high- resolution structure of natively assembled PCDH15-CDH23 complexes using crystallography and cryo-EM. Structural data will be validated biochemically and by functional interrogation of mutant cadherins in the physiologically relevant mechanosensory hair cells paying attention to mutations associated with disease. We anticipate that our studies will provide the first high-resolution native structure of any protein complex important for mechanotransduction and provide mechanistic insights into its functional properties and pathophysiological mechanisms that are associated with different forms of hearing impairment."
"9433462","Stroke, the 5th leading cause of death in the United States, is responsible for approximately 129,000 deaths per year (AHA Statistics). It is well recognized that cerebrovascular homeostasis is vital for the brain's functional and structural integrity, and alteration of endothelial cell functions has been inferred in the pathogenesis of stroke, even when the cause was unknown. Recently we discovered that sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis plays a very important role in preserving endothelial cell functions, to impact hypertension, inflammation and heart failure. However, direct evidence of a causative role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis cerebrovascular diseases, especially ischemic stroke, is lacking. In this regard, we generated a mouse that lacks SPT specifically in the endothelium (ECKO-Sptlc2), and report that this mouse develops spontaneous ischemic stroke. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that blocking the de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis by genetically excision of the SPT enzyme specifically in the endothelium, will lead to endothelial dysfunction with the onset of a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state, sufficient to trigger the ischemic stroke. To test this hypothesis we propose two aims: 1) characterize ECKO-Sptlc2 mice as a novel model of ischemic stroke triggered by the altered sphingolipid pathway in the vascular endothelium. In this aim we will characterize the extent and distribution of the ischemic lesions; measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF); assess the endothelial-dependent vasodilation by measuring local changes in CBF via a laser-Doppler probe (Perimed); and map the location of thrombi in the ischemic brains of ECKO-Sptlc2 mice. Aim 2) to define the dysfunctional state of EC lacking Sptlc2 and the changes in sphingolipid levels contributing to this condition. We will measure sphingolipid levels in ECKO-Sptlc2 and Sptlc2f/f cerebral tissue and primary brain EC in culture; assess in vivo blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability in ECKO-Sptlc2 and control mice; measure murine brain endothelial barrier function in basal and following pro-permeability stimuli. Circulating inflammatory and thrombotic markers, will be measured in ECKO-Sptlc2 and control mice by using Luminex. Histological analysis of coronal brain and heart sections for endothelial inflammatory (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM) and pro-thrombotic markers (e.g., VWF, PAI-1) will be performed; FACS analysis for inflammatory and pro- thrombotic activation markers in ECKO-Sptlc2 and control brain and heart endothelial cell. The major goal of the study is to systematically characterize this novel animal model of endothelial dysfunction- triggered ischemic stroke, in order to build future preclinical and translational studies on a solid foundation."

This collaboration has a two-fold purpose: (1) to maintain a dynamic combined active and passive surveillance system for MD, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and related conditions, and (2) to develop and manage a data system that allows us to conduct ongoing analyses of health care utilization, costs, and community participation of people with these conditions.  The SC MDSS has three specific aims to support this purpose. These include:  Specific Aim 1: Conduct population-based surveillance for muscular dystrophies and neuromuscular disorders using methods based on those from the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet).  Specific Aim 2: Analyze surveillance and administrative data to describe health care utilization and costs for each MD type, SMA, and other disorders Specific Aim 3: Develop statistical models to determine associations between specific treatment (medical, pharmaceutical, and related therapies) and specific outcomes (use of mobility aides, residence in home, progression of disability status, etc.) for each type of MD and neuromuscular disorder.  To accomplish these aims, the SC MDSS will conduct active surveillance for MD and SMA through medical records abstraction in physician offices, hospitals, and clinics identified through Medicaid, State Health Plan, and physician licensure datasets. Furthermore, the SC MDSS will conduct passive surveillance for MD and SMA through the following linked datasets: hospital discharge data, emergency department data, Medicaid data, state health plan data, vital records data, and birth defects surveillance data. Appropriate epidemiologic and statistical methods will be used to accomplish the aims through the data collected. Health services research frameworks and innovative research methods, such as small area analysis, will be utilized."
"9519551","Project Summary Breast reconstruction after tumor resection, traumatic wounds from war, and congenital defects often require a soft tissue filler to restore contour. Autologous adipose grafting has recently become the preferred standard of care for doctors because it is minimally invasive, limits chance of rejection, stems from a readily available source, and is inexpensive. Adipose also contains stem cells with the capability of differentiating into various cells needed for reconstruction. However, results of the procedure are unpredictable due to post-graft resorption caused by tissue necrosis. Up to 90% volume of the original volume can be resorbed 6 months post implantation. To address this critical issue, we plan to investigate the use of an injectable adipogenic hydrogel to enhance autologous fat graft survival. A decellularized adipose extracellular matrix will serve as the main polymer source for the hydrogel that also will contain dexamethasone-encapsulated microspheres to increase vascularization. The decellularized matrix will be fully characterized to demonstrate reproducibility of a material containing minimal cellular, DNA, and lipid content. Immunohistochemistry will determine protein content such as collagen, laminin, elastin, and other constitutive proteins. Dexamethasone-encapsulated microspheres will be placed in culture with peripheral bone marrow cells to determine bioactivity and in vitro release studies will determine drug discharge over time. Once the hydrogel is formed, cell culture studies with adipose derived stem cells will be conducted to access biocompatibility of the scaffold and its ability to differentiate the stems into adipocytes that produce lipids, representing its adipogenicity. An in vivo study using athymic mice as a small animal model will be the next step in the investigation. Liposuctioned adipose tissue will be processed and injected subcutaneously as a graft is prepared for patient undergoing autologous adipose graft treatment. These grafts are compared to a treatment group containing adipose tissue along with the injectable hydrogel and microspheres to observe volume retention and tissue histology after 3, 12, and 24 weeks. It is believed that the composite hydrogel scaffold will contain the necessary proteins and adipogensis biological factors to improve graft survival, which is desperately needed in the area of soft tissue reconstruction. Restoration of contour for patients with soft tissue defects is important for their emotional well-being, protection of underlying structure, and maintaining a normal human appearance."

"9664059","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis affects more than 200 million people worldwide. Therapeutic approaches to osteoporotic bone loss have focused on either anabolic or antiresorptive agents. However, there is a pressing need to develop new agents that target both bone formation and resorption. NELL-1 is a potent pro-osteogenic protein most studied for its local bone forming effects. Preliminary studies have suggested that NELL-1 also exerts a systemic, protective function against osteoporotic bone loss via modulating both osteoblast and osteoclast activity. These cellular effects of NELL-1 appear to occur in large part via activation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Excitingly, we have recently identified the presence of two NELL-1 isoforms (NELL-1570 and NELL-1810) - of which the former demonstrates significantly greater bone forming effects. This has led to our central hypothesis that NELL-1 is a promising systemic therapeutic agent for osteoporosis with ability to (1) effectively reverse osteoporotic bone loss, and (2) regulate bone homeostasis by regulating osteoblast (OB) and osteoclast (OC) differentiation and activity via Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Furthermore, we anticipate that the shor isoform of NELL-1 (NELL-1570) will demonstrate more potent in vivo anabolic effects. We will test these hypotheses in two specific aims: AIM 1: Compare NELL-1570 and NELL-1810 for the systemic treatment of OVX-induced osteoporosis in mice. Our preliminary data show that systemic rNELL-1 (NELL-1810) reverses OVX-induced bone loss in mice. However, accumulating evidence suggests that NELL-1570 has significantly more potent effects on osteoprogenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. AIM 1 will directly compare systemic administration of NELL-1810 and NELL-1570. Through radiologic, histologic, histomorphometric and biomechanical analyses, we will examine bone density, formation, turnover and strength.  AIM 2: Compare the isolated cellular effects of NELL-1570 and NELL-1810 on OB/OC progenitor cells and OB/OC activity. In parallel, AIM 2 will evaluate systemic rNELL-1 effects on the number and activity of stem cells, OB and OC cells, as well as Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Cells will be isolated from animals after systemic treatment with NELL-1570 or NELL-1810, and examined by flow cytometry, proliferation and differentiation assays.  Novel rNELL-1 based therapies can improve the current standard of care for the treatment of osteoporosis, and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures that cost $25 billion annually. As well, improved basic biological understanding of rNELL-1 regulation of Wnt signaling may lead to future therapies for other disease entities characterized by deregulated Wnt signaling."

"9574158","Growing evidence indicates that severe derangements in lipid fingerprints are characteristic of many brain diseases and nervous system disorders including Alzheimer?s disease (AD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI) and schizophrenia. There are many questions, however, regarding the nature of these derangements including how they occur, and whether therapies might be developed to correct or exploit them. Lipidomics is an important and timely area of research because of its ability to comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate levels of lipids responsible for signaling such as phosphoinositol metabolites and arachidonic acid metabolites providing insights into biology not previously available. This information when integrated with other ?omics? data in advanced bioinformatics models provides a superb method for identifying key drivers in biology and disease mechanisms, as well as identifying new drug targets for pharmaceuticals development. Advances in electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry have facilitated the precise profiling of lipid species within tissues, including low abundance lipid classes that participate in cell signaling and membrane trafficking attributable to disease pathogenesis. We propose to perform complete analysis of lipid fingerprints using liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry by LC/MS in combination with HPLC analysis within JJP VAMC expertise for lipidomics and metabolomics measurements from lipid extracts of cultured cell lines, primary cultures or tissue samples. The instrument requested in this application is a Triple Quadrupole LC/MS System with Jet Stream Technology consisting of high speed pumps, multiple columns (up to 8) with thermostat control between 4-1100C, multi-sampler up to 600 bars for well-plates and individual sample containers suitable for larger high throughput and pilot studies, respectively. The high throughput automation capabilities will let us analyze samples in 96-well plates in less than ten minutes which provide capacity for high throughput analysis of large scale samples. The instrument is designed to be easily used by individuals who do not have specialized training in lipidomics and metabolomics. These instruments are manufactured by Agilent Technologies. The purchase price includes on-site installation and familiarization training and a one-year warranty including a one-year PC image recovery and software upgrade and phone assistance. Data analysis software is available from the manufacturer for licenses of two workstations. The instrument?s detection limits are lower than ever and for the first time achieve zeptomole level sensitivity at convenient flow rates. No equivalent instrument dedicated to lipidomics and metabolomics is available at JJPVA or our academic affiliate the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. If funded, the instrument will be used in VA-funded projects in the fields of Alzheimer?s disease, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. The instrument would add the capacity for systematic study of lipid homeostasis and metabolism in cultured cells, mouse and postmortem human brain and spinal cord tissue samples, and would thereby substantially broaden and enhance the understanding of medical conditions that affect the health and quality of life of veterans impacted by these diseases and disabilities."
"9542464","Project Summary The last 10 years have witnessed explosive advances in our understanding of how the organization of chromatin, the association of DNA with histones and the vast number of non-histone regulatory proteins, controls the expression of specific genes in brain. Likely prominent among such regulatory mechanisms are covalent modifications of histones, along with the writers, erasers, and readers of these modifications. Much of the work delineating these mechanisms has contributed to the notion that a `histone code' is a central determinant of a gene's activity and its potential to be activated or repressed in response to a subsequent stimulus (e.g., elicit drug exposure). Indeed, increasing evidence has suggested the significance of histone modifications in behavioral models, although we are still at the earliest stages of examining all of the many chromatin changes potentially involved. Based, in part, on our work in the field of addiction neuroepigenetics, we now have substantial evidence for profound regulation of chromatin mechanisms in rodent models and in human postmortem brain: chronic psychostimulant exposure alters covalent modifications of histones that may powerfully influence addiction vulnerability; and chronic cocaine alters the functionality of specific ?writer? and ?eraser? enzymes that control these modifications, as well as the ?reader? proteins that translate the modifications into functional responses. Although exciting, nearly all data to date indicating roles for histone modifications in addiction plasticity have been deduced from studies involving manipulations of associated enzymes and/or correlational sequencing analyses, with little to no attention paid to the development of novel methodologies that would allow for direct, causal manipulations of histone modifications in brain. Therefore, this Cutting Edge Basic Research Award (CEBRA) proposal aims to fully apply a novel intein- based chemical methodology for directly introducing specific histone modifications (or combinations thereof) in neurons to directly assess their impact on transcriptional plasticity and addiction related behaviors. To do so, we will focus on two forms of histone modifications (permissive?H3.3 pan-acetyl and repressive?H3.3K9me2) that have previously been implicated in cocaine responsiveness, both by our group and others. Since our initial submission last year, we have now chemically optimized the efficiency of the intein system for use in brain and provide robust preliminary data toward this effect. Thus, we now aim to: 1) assess the impact of promoting such modifications (which, based upon previous findings, are expected to result in opposing behavioral outcomes) on relapse related behaviors in male vs. female rats; and 2) fully examine the transcriptional impact of directly introducing specific histone modifications in chromatin in neurons using next generation sequencing, both in the context of cocaine self-administration (SA) and in drug naive animals (e.g., food SA). We feel that this novel methodology will have a broad impact on future studies related to neuroepigenetic plasticity in addiction, and will be highly applicable to numerous other research areas. !"
"9451160","Project Summary/Abstract The objective of this proposal is to provide Dr. Wolfgram a pathway to independence as a clinical investigator and expert in the field of cognitive and functional outcomes in adults on dialysis. The overall goal of Dr. Wolfgram is to improve the health and well-being of patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with hemodialysis (HD) by dedicating her career to evaluation, prevention and management of the cognitive and functional impairment that is highly prevalent in the HD population. In this proposal Dr. Wolfgram will focus on evaluation of a HD process-specific risk factor for cognitive decline in a HD cohort. The current literature and Dr. Wolfgram?s prior work suggest that, in addition to traditional patient risk factors for cognitive impairment, the HD process may further contribute to cognitive decline. Conventional HD causes circulatory stress that can lead to perfusion abnormalities and ischemic injury in end-organs. Brain injury, specifically, may occur due to changes in cerebral perfusion during HD. Patients on HD may have impaired cerebral auto-regulation due to vascular disease from common comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and older age and from ESRD-specific risk factors such as vascular calcification from impaired calcium and phosphate regulation. Cerebral hypo-perfusion may occur during HD sessions due to systemic hemodynamic fluctuation in the setting of impaired cerebral autoregulation. This may lead to cerebral ischemic injury and subsequent cognitive decline. In this proposal Dr. Wolfgram will conduct a prospective cohort study evaluating intradialytic change in cerebral perfusion as a risk factor for decline in cognitive status. Dr. Wolfgram will use cerebral oximetry, measured by near-infrared spectroscopy, as an index for cerebral perfusion during HD sessions. She will evaluate three cognitive focused outcomes 1) cerebral white matter integrity measured with brain MRI, 2) cognitive performance measured with neuropsychological tests in the NIH Toolbox cognition battery, and 3) patient reported cognitive function measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems. Results of this study will determine if changes in cerebral oximetry during HD are predictive of decline in cognitive outcomes overtime, and potentially identify a target for future therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing cognitive decline. In order to complete this study and achieve her goal of developing expertise in clinical outcomes research in the HD population Dr. Wolfgram will follow a career development training plan focused on research methodology, cerebral imaging, neuropsychology, and patient reported outcome measures. Her training will be guided by her mentor and advisors at the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Berman Center for Clinical Outcomes Research and Marquette University. Completion of this research proposal along with the formal training activities will allow Dr. Wolfgram to lead research work aimed at reducing the cognitive and functional impairment that is highly prevalent in our HD population."
"9529662","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a strong risk factor and remains the only modifiable target for intervention. However, the mechanisms causing elevated IOP remain poorly understood. Using Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe, a rare X-linked disease that presents with congenital glaucoma, we have found evidence that OCRL is an important regulator of trafficking in the eye that controls IOP. OCRL is an inositol phosphatase mutated in Lowe syndrome. OCRL localizes within the primary cilium, a subcellular organelle that plays a mechanosensory role in fluid flow. We have identified patients with Lowe syndrome who are born with congenital glaucoma and have characterized their mutations. We discovered that OCRL interacts with TRPV4, a mechanosensory channel in the primary cilia and that modulation of TRPV4 affects IOP in mice. Thus we hypothesize that OCRL plays a critical role in the recruitment of TRPV4 to the cilia in the trabecular meshwork to regulate aqueous outflow. Our aims are to (1) determine the mechanism of OCRL transport in the primary cilium in the trabecular meshwork, (2) determine the functional role of OCRL and TRPV4 interaction in the primary cilium, (3) determine whether targeting TRPV4 can reduce IOP in murine models. The experiments of this proposal may facilitate the discovery of new glaucoma therapies that can reduce the burden of blindness."
"9421956","In our NIDA-funded R34 pilot study of pain self-management training for prescription opioid taper support, we demonstrated that 22 weeks of opioid taper support promotes opioid dose reduction more effectively than usual care (43% vs 19% dose reduction from baseline) with no increase in pain intensity and significantly reduced activity interference. We now propose to adapt and test this intervention in a large integrated primary care system. To address patients? fears of opioid taper that limited recruitment into our pilot study, we will begin with randomization to pain self-management training and then offer the option of self-paced opioid taper: Pain Self-Management Training for Opioid Taper (PSMOT). Specifically, we will test the effectiveness of this intervention, compared with usual care, on opioid dose and pain outcomes among patients on high dose (? 50 mg morphine equivalent dose) LtOT in a randomized controlled trial. This intervention will have 4 components: a) telephone-delivered evidence-based pain self-management training, b) web-based video of successfully tapered patients with motivational interviewing debriefing, c) a voluntary, self-paced opioid taper, and d) opioid and non-opioid prescribing guidance for the patient?s primary care provider. Specific Aim 1: To adapt our previously developed prescription opioid taper support intervention into a telephone-delivered pain self- management training that provides the option for supported opioid taper (PSMOT). This will be delivered in multiple primary care clinics by a nurse interventionist trained and supervised by a pain psychologist and will include guidance in opioid and non-opioid medication prescribing. Specific Aim 2: To test in a randomized trial the effects of this PSMOT intervention on: a) opioid outcomes: daily opioid dose (primary outcome), percent dose reduction from baseline, problem opioid use (interview, questionnaire, and electronic health record text indicators), and patient-reported opioid problems; and b) pain-related outcomes: PEG (self-report of Pain intensity, Enjoyment of life interference, General activity interference; primary outcome), pain self-efficacy, and depression symptoms. Hypotheses pertaining to opioid use: Patients receiving LtOT for CNCP randomized to the PSMOT intervention, as compared with those randomized to usual care, will have lower opioid doses, greater percent reduction of opioid dose, lower proportions with problem opioid use, and lower levels of patient-reported opioid-related problems at 6 and 12 months after randomization. Hypotheses pertaining to pain outcomes: Patients receiving LtOT for CNCP randomized to the PSMOT intervention, as compared with those randomized to usual care, will have lower PEG scores, higher levels of pain self-efficacy, and lower levels of depressive symptoms at 6 and 12 months after randomization. The proposed trial will determine whether pain self-management training can promote prescription opioid taper in higher-dose long-term opioid therapy patients without increasing pain levels or activity interference. If this trial is successful, then prescribers and patients may be able to pursue supported opioid taper without fear of escalating pain."

"9495847","Treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly effective, yet dramatically underutilized. Individuals with OUD are frequently hospitalized, but have poor health outcomes and low rates of addiction treatment involvement. Hospital-based addiction consult services have the potential to make a significant contribution to narrowing the OUD treatment gap. These multidisciplinary teams can start medication for addiction treatment (MAT) while patients are hospitalized, and directly link them to ongoing post-discharge outpatient treatment. Such addiction consult services are proliferating in response to the opioid epidemic, but with little research on their effectiveness or guidance on their implementation. There now exists a unique and time-limited opportunity to study an addiction consult model (Consult for Addiction Treatment and Care in Hospitals (CATCH)) as it rolls out in the largest municipal hospital system in the US. The overarching objective of our proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of CATCH as a strategy for engaging patients with OUD in MAT. A pragmatic trial at 4 hospitals, conducted in collaboration with the NYC Health and Hospitals system (H+H) and the NYC Dept. of Health, will study the CATCH intervention in real-world settings and at scale. All intervention costs are borne by H+H. Guided by the RE-AIM evaluation framework, this hybrid effectiveness- implementation study (Type 1) focuses primarily on effectiveness, but also measures implementation outcomes inform the intervention's adoption and sustainability. A rigorous stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design determines the impact of CATCH on opioid treatment outcomes in comparison to usual care for a control period, followed by a 12-month intervention period and a 12-18 month maintenance period, and utilizes existing administrative data to evaluate outcomes. Aim 1 (primary aim) is to evaluate the effectiveness of CATCH in increasing post-discharge initiation and engagement in MAT, defined respectively as receiving outpatient MAT within 14 days of discharge, and having at least 2 additional MAT visits in the first month. Aim 2 is to assess the effectiveness of CATCH for increasing treatment retention, defined as continuous receipt of MAT for 6 months. Aim 3 is to compare the frequency of acute care utilization and overdose deaths, and their associated costs, among patients with OUD who are hospitalized during the CATCH period versus usual care. Aim 4 is to evaluate implementation outcomes at CATCH sites using a mixed methods approach to assess the intervention's Reach (proportion of eligible patients reached); Adoption (utilization by medical staff); and Implementation fidelity (barriers to delivering high-quality MAT). This research will provide the first evaluation of an addiction consult model in a multi-site trial, and promises to generate knowledge that can rapidly transform practice and inform the intervention's potential for widespread dissemination, in NYC and nationally. Ultimately, this knowledge can transform hospitalizations into an opportunity to engage patients with OUD in effective treatment, resulting in immediate and lasting improvements in health and functioning."

"9514143","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has been reported to be associated with glomerular injury and ultimate end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although hypertension or diabetes mellitus in obesity may contribute to the development of ESRD, the molecular mechanisms of obesity-induced renal injury, in particular, the early mechanisms mediating glomerular injury that occur prior to hypertension and diabetes are still poorly understood. In thi grant proposal, we attempt to elucidate an early intracellular molecular mechanism, namely, the Nalp3 inflammasome activation, which may switch on glomerular injury through its inflammatory or non-inflammatory pathway leading to glomerular dysfunction and ultimately sclerosis during obesity. Interestingly, our preliminary studies demonstrated that obesity-induces the Nalp3 inflammasome activation and contributes to the glomerular injury independent of elevated arterial blood pressure and have also shown that beyond inflammation, the activated inflammasomes have direct actions on the podocytes. This may represent a novel pathogenic mechanism of inflammasome activation beyond inflammation. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that obesity increases visfatin production and thereby activates Nalp3 inflammasomes in podocytes to produce IL-1ß stimulating inflammatory response in glomeruli and initiating direct podocyte damage, ultimately resulting in glomerular injury and sclerosis. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine whether obesity-induced Nalp3 inflammasome formation and activation contribute to glomerular injury in vivo prior to hypertension in experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity using Asc-/- mice with or without rescuing Asc gene and wild type mice with and without locally silencing Asc gene. We will then examine how Nalp3 inflammasomes are activated in podocytes with a focus on the role of adipokine visfatin in cultured podocytes and in vivo in mice and to elucidate its functional significance in inflammasome activation. Finally, we will explore the mechanisms by which activated Nalp3 inflammasomes lead to podocyte injury and glomerular dysfunction or sclerosis by studying the actions of inflammasome products such as IL-1ß, IL-18, pyroptosis and DAMPs in cultured podocytes and in mice with obesity induced by HFD. The findings from the proposed studies will provide new mechanistic insights for targeting inflammasomes to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treatment and prevention of ESRD in obese patients."
"9467113","PROJECT SUMMARY  Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) includes a broad range of progressive disease stages: fatty liver, alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.1-3 In spite of being one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the world, there are currently no effective strategies that can prevent, treat or monitor the progress of ALD owing primarily to lack of human and physiologically-relevant research models. At Emulate we have developed proprietary technology to build human microphysiological systems recapitulating tissue architecture to achieve organ level physiological functions. We have recently used this technology and developed a mature, functional human Liver-Chip we can maintain for more than four weeks in culture. Our proposed research will focus on developing the ALD-Chip based on the current model of Liver-Chip. The goal of the proposed Phase I SBIR is to develop a human, physiologically relevant ALD model on chip and recapitulate the different stages of human disease progression from potential for reversibility as it has been well described in human patients1,3-5 to the different stages of the irreversible disease. Along these lines we will develop the ALD-Chip to model the main aspects of ALD, including alcoholic fatty liver and alcoholic hepatitis steatosis (ASH) (Phase I), and eventually (Phase II) the alcoholic fibrotic disease stage. Emulate's developed Liver-Chip is a microphysiological system constructed with primary human hepatic cells (the gold standard in the field) inside a microengineered environment incorporating flow, that emulates the liver sinusoid space architecture and allows for dynamic assessment of liver functions over time. Based on this recent development that provides significant improvements as compared to the previously described in vitro systems for human liver studies,4-6 we are now enabled to apply ethanol concentrations relevant to those measured in human patients blood and monitor development of human ALD on the Chip using clinically relevant endpoints. Combination of ethanol dosing and length of experimentation should recapitulate the different stages in ALD progression including capability for reversibility of the established phenotype. The proposed research for Phase I of this SBIR has two aims: (i) The development and optimization of human ALD-Chip by characterizing the dose-response to physiological relevant ethanol dosing conditions (Aim I), and (ii) to validate the in vivo relevance of human ALD-Chip developed in Aim 1 by the characterization of the progression of different ASH stages in the ALD-Chip: (1) alcoholic fatty liver and (2) alcoholic hepatitis and determine the reversibility of the pathology in association to severity and time as in the human disease. We plan to optimize the ALD-Chip to provide the scientific community with a platform for new drug development and screening for liver injury therapies, treatments for protection of alcohol users from transitioning to more severe disease stages associated with a number of co-morbidities. Further, as all Emulate's Organ Chips are based on human primary cells they can be used to provide insights on patient-specific responses, as needed, and to support targeted diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers discovery. In conclusion, we propose to develop an ALD-Chip to translate ALD preclinical data into a testable and clinically relevant ALD model enabling a better understanding of this disease and support of drug discovery."
"9524420","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older adults will be disproportionately affected by the complications arising from metabolic diseases including diabetes, heart disease and neurodegeneration, predicted to double between now and 2050. However, the fundamental mechanisms that link obesity and metabolic disease with longevity remain poorly understood. The central nervous system is a major driver of lipid metabolism and lifespan. However neuroendocrine signals that specifically control metabolism and lifespan are poorly understood in any system, and cannot be modeled in cell culture. The long-term goal of my laboratory is to decipher the neural circuits and neuroendocrine mechanisms that regulate metabolism and lifespan, and to define the key regulatory principles that govern their relationship. We have uncovered an integrated neuro-metabolic system that underlies communication between the nervous system and the intestine in the C. elegans model system, in which ancient and conserved aspects of neuroendocrine biology can be discovered with state-of-the-art molecular tools. We define two critical nodes for the regulation of this neuroendocrine system: one neuronal, one metabolic. The neuronal node integrates food and oxygen sensory information from the environment, and the metabolic node integrates fat loss with mitochondrial stress. Our central hypothesis is that the neuronal and metabolic nodes counterbalance one another to maintain the integrity of neuroendocrine homeostasis, and that disruption of this counterbalancing mechanism at either node alters lifespan. The objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular mechanisms that regulate the homeostatic balance between the neuronal and metabolic nodes, and to identify the key drivers that protect longevity. Thus, our neuroendocrine pathway defines a unique and powerful model to study the consequences of neuronally-stimulated lipid metabolism, on longevity. Aim 1 will define the neural circuit mechanisms that integrate neuroendocrine signaling, fat metabolism and lifespan. Our goal is to scale multiple levels of analysis from molecular, circuit-level and organismal properties to achieve mechanistic insights how the activity of a multimodal neural circuit gives rise to coordinated physiological shifts in metabolism and longevity. Aim 2 will identify the mechanistic interactions between neuronally-driven fat loss and mitochondrial stress-sensing pathways in the intestine, which ultimately drive lifespan. Using molecular genetic approaches, biochemical analyses, metabolic and lifespan assays, we will uncover the molecular mechanisms that couple fat loss with stress-protective mechanisms that together determine longevity. A major expected outcome of our proposed studies is that longevity is an emergent property, determined by the extent to which mitochondrial stress in metabolic tissues can counterbalance the neuronal drive for fat loss. The experiments proposed in Aims 1 and 2 are expected to pinpoint, at a molecular level, the integrative mechanisms that underlie this neuroendocrine homeostasis. This knowledge is critical for the future design of safe and effective drugs to combat metabolic diseases that accompany aging."
"9640187","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of retinal damage, the leading cause of blindness in Western countries and, as the name implies, a disease of aging. Like other age-related diseases, AMD is particularly challenging to study because it takes decades to develop and so any research model must recapitulate the conditions of an older organism.  Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and linkage analyses have provided the first clues to what might cause AMD. These studies identified three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are strong risk factors for AMD.1 One SNP lies in the 402H allele in the CFH gene and the two others are tightly linked and lie in the neighboring HTRA1 and ARMS2 genes. These SNPs confer the most significant genetic risk factors in the history of GWAS studies in human genetics. People homozygous for these SNPs have a 50-fold increased risk of AMD.  How these mutations might cause sight to deteriorate is unclear, however, because the underlying molecular mechanisms of AMD are unknown. Recently, however, our unbiased proteome analysis suggested super oxide dismutase (SOD) mechanisms are perturbed in affected cells and that, over time, this introduces reactive oxidative species (ROS) mediated cellular insults that eventually manifest as AMD. If ROS metabolism is indeed disrupted in AMD, then we might finally begin to address the causes of the disease.  We believe the hurdles faced in finding causes and treatments for AMD could be circumvented by stem cell technologies. To this end we have found a way to differentiate stem cells from patients into retinal cells. Moreover, we developed a protocol that recapitulates aging in these patient-stem-cell-derived retinal cells. Finally, through gene-targeting technology, we can manipulate the stem cell genome, targeting disease- associated SNPs, to determine the individual contributions of each. By applying these powerful methodologies, we believe we can finally identify the root causes of AMD and so begin to develop new therapies.  Our goals will be accomplished in two specific aims: Aim 1A. Use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to convert HTRA1 and ARMS2 alleles from low-risk to high risk in patient-derived stem cells. Aim 1B. Determine the individual contribution of human HTRA1 and ARMS2 alleles to AMD pathogenesis. Test whether CRISPR conversion from low to high-risk AMD alleles in Aim 1A affects ROS levels in cells. Aim 2. Test the function of patient-stem-cell-derived RPE in a human-mouse chimera, in vivo assay."
"9543158","ABSTRACT: The ability to predict the optimal therapy for an individual patient is a major unmet need in the treatment of cancer and other diseases. The majority of therapies in clinical cancer treatment, particularly cytotoxics as well as combinations of multiple drugs, have no reliable predictor of response. This uninformed therapy selection is highly inefficient and likely leads to reduced therapeutic success rates, increased side effects and excessive economic expenditures. I develop novel ?lab-in-a-patient? technology to probe, monitor, and eventually treat disease in real time within human tissue. A tiny, minimally invasive device will provide continuous output of information that reveals disease biology and informs treatment options. ?Lab-in-a-patient? technology has the potential to act as a micro-pathology laboratory by allowing the real-time measurement of response to multiple therapies or other chemical perturbagens simultaneously within the patient. We have achieved proof-of-concept for release of microdoses of a large number of distinct drugs or molecular ?sensors? in parallel into native tissue, with analysis of the effect for each such compound (Science Translational Medicine, 284ra57, 2015). We are augmenting this technology with miniaturized detection methods that enable optical in situ real-time monitoring of disease state and the effects of small molecules and biologics near each drug reservoir. This blend of high-throughput chemical perturbation and optical detection in a single instrument will, for the first time, enable diseased tissue to be monitored and functionally characterized in a continuous and noninvasive manner. It will thus provide unprecendented detail, precision and speed of analyzing response and resistance to therapeutics through live in situ readouts of signaling pathways, metabolites and other molecular markers. This approach may eventually push medicine away from trial-and-error treatments with longer-term macroscale endpoints and towards precision management of disease by probing, treating and monitoring locally at the microscale level. Use of the technology for local delivery of biological (non- therapeutic) probes into native tissue creates the capability for fundamental insights through direct stimulus-response measurements with real-time in situ monitoring, particularly in the areas of immunology, metabolism and cancer formation where the local tissue microenvironment plays a key role in the molecular processes underlying disease biology. In the fullness of time, these devices may enable individualized and real-time selection of optimal therapies and could facilitate rational design of more effective, personalized therapeutic regimens in numerous cancer indications. The proposed project spans continued technological and translational development that support eventual commercialization."
"9493891","PROJECT SUMMARY Vanderbilt requests funds for the purchase of a Nanion SynchroPatch 384 automated ?planar patch clamp? electrophysiology system. Patch-clamp electrophysiology is considered the ?gold standard? for measuring the activity of ion channels. Electrophysiology excels at measuring key functional properties of ion channels that are difficult or impossible to measure by other techniques, such as activation, inactivation, and deactivation kinetics, unitary or macroscopic conductance, and voltage dependence. Being able to measure these properties is critical for understanding mechanisms involved in modulation of ion channels by pharmacological agents, cell signaling pathways, and by disease-related mutations. Until recently, patch-clamp electrophysiology was an exceedingly slow, technically challenging, one-cell-at-a time technique. The advent of so-called ?planar patch clamp? technology has revolutionized patch clamping by replacing the pipette-based electrode with a planar glass substrate that avoids the technically challenging and slow spatial positioning of the pipette relative to the cells. The planar substrate is adhered to the bottom of a multi-well plate and is designed to catch a single cell or multiple cells for recordings. In 2008 Vanderbilt obtained a first-generation automated device, the Nanion PatchLiner. While useful, the 8-channel PatchLiner lacks the throughput to significantly impact the bottlenecks faced by Vanderbilt investigators. In the intervening years, devices that take advantage of the planar approach married with a traditional 384-well assay plate format stand have dramatically increased the throughput of patch clamp largely eliminating electrophysiology as a rate-limiting step in the advancement of our understanding ion channels? function in normal and pathophysiological settings. Vanderbilt has a history of excellence in ion channel research. Over the past decade Vanderbilt ion channel investigators have developed research programs focused on the discovery and development of small molecule ion channel modulators and the identification and characterization of disease related ion channel mutations. Although Vanderbilt investigators have been successful using fluorescence-based approaches to discover small molecules that modulate the activity of ion channels, these fluorescent approaches have substantial limitations that can be overcome by the strengths of the SynchroPatch. The sizeable disconnect between the throughput of fluorescence-based HTS approaches and traditional, one-cell-at-a-time patch clamp presents a bottleneck that severely limits our ability rapidly develop the potent and selective small molecule ion channel modulators. Similarly, Vanderbilt investigators who study a wide-range of mutations which are associated with disease are limited by the sheer number of mutations and complex phenotypes found in the human population. Applying the benefits of the SynchroPatch to both of these problems will decrease timelines by tens of folds."

"9452144","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bioinformatics and genomics are transforming medicine and basic research at a rapid pace, challenging K-12 students and teachers to keep up. There have been several calls to introduce these concepts earlier in the curriculum. However, it is not just modern science that is failing to reach our students. Our students are not succeeding in basic science, particularly students who are traditionally underrepresented in scientific fields. Teachers who do not have comprehensive or up-to-date scientific background contribute to this problem, as does a steep decline in student science interest during middle school. The result is a scientific workforce that does not mirror U.S. diversity and a population that does not appreciate the importance, relevance, or excitement of science. This project reinforces basic science concepts, sparks interest and prepares students for personal, academic and professional encounters with bioinformatics and genomics (e.g. tumor profiling, personalized medicine and/or science careers). The project provides a partnership model involving teachers, scientists and pedagogy experts to develop bioinformatics-enhanced instructional units.            Teachers will work collaboratively with scientists and pedagogy experts to design bioinformatics-based units, and then implement the units in their classrooms. As the project matures, the teachers and project team will tailor the bioinformatics-based units to the local community, focusing on cultural and local relevancy. A mixed methods approach will be used to analyze and evaluate outcomes. Teacher and student learning will be analyzed quantitatively, and qualitative methods will be used to assess the impact on teacher and student interest and engagement.            Specific Aims      1. Provide teacher professional development through intensive, collaborative workshops.      2. Field test and evaluate the innovative bioinformatics-enhanced activities in classrooms with a high proportion of URM students.     3. Disseminate tools and inform scientific, science education, and outreach communities about the impact of this approach.

"9444354","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become the most widely used high-throughput technology in biology. Today, NGS applications go far beyond genome sequencing and studies of DNA sequence itself to include the measurement of quantitative and dynamic outcomes underlying genomic function in development and disease. These measurements, specifically, RNA abundance, protein binding, DNA methylation, and microbiome composition, are at the core of studies undertaken by large consortia and individual labs alike. However, when measuring these quantitative outcomes, NGS data are subject to severe technological and biological biases, systematic errors, and unforeseen variability which can greatly impact downstream analyses. Only when these issues can be readily identified and addressed will the technology maximally benefit science and medicine. Our group has extensive experience developing statistical methods that transform raw high- throughput data into the ultimate measurements relied upon by biologists and clinicians. Our gene expression array preprocessing methods are practically an industry standard and our recent work on NGS applications is widely cited and used. Furthermore, Dr. Irizarry co-leads the Bioconductor project, one of the most widely used open-source projects for the development and dissemination of state-of-the-art statistical methodology. We propose to continue to leverage our experience with high-throughput technologies to develop indispensable analysis tools for NGS data in four critical, widely used applications urgently requiring reliable statistical analysis tols. At the core of our methods is the common need, across these four applications, to overcome bias, systematic error, and unforeseen variability. To aid in the development and assessment of these tools we propose experiments specifically designed to serve as benchmarks. These problems are matched well to our specific expertise and we will address them with the following aims. 1) Develop statistical methods for RNA transcript estimation that are robust to sequencing artifacts. 2) Develop statistical methods that estimate heterogenous cell composition in DNA methylation data. 3) Develop statistical methods for unbiased quantification in microbial community 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies. 4) Develop methods that account for protocol-induced bias in genome-wide enrichment scans (e.g., ChIP-seq and DNase I-seq)."
"9542588","PROJECT SUMMARY Carotenoids are C40 isoprenoid pigments synthesized by plants and microorganisms with essential photoreception and photoprotection roles in photosynthesis. Plant apocarotenoids - derived from cleavage of carotenoids ? are also important regulators of development and physiological responses. Animals absorb carotenoids from the diet and use them for pigmentation, protection from oxidative stress and as vitamin A precursors upon conversion into retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives). In addition, apocarotenoids possess potent biological activities in mammals, functioning as nuclear receptor ligands that regulate numerous pathways of cell signaling. Thus, dietary carotenoids impact on human health and disease development with multiple mechanisms, throughout the life cycle. Dietary carotenoids ? lutein, in particular - are emerging as important modulators of infant and child visual and cognitive development. As precursors of vitamin A, carotenoids - mainly beta-carotene - are also important contributors to human embryonic development and growth. A major effort in carotenoid research has focused on the biofortification of staple crops, including rice, with provitamin A carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, for global prevention of VAD which remains an overwhelming public health issue, affecting millions of pregnant women and children in over half of all countries worldwide. Dietary carotenoid consumption has long been associated with decreased risk of a variety of human chronic diseases, such as cancer and more recently neurodegenerative diseases. A vibrant community of researchers has advanced our knowledge on the above research areas in recent years. Comparative research between plants and animals has revealed an impressive conservation of key enzymes that catalyze the various transformations of carotenoids and apocarotenoids. The carotenoid Gordon Conference is the only meeting that addresses the full spectrum of carotenoid research ?from ?nature to bedside?. The main objectives of the 2018 edition are: (1) To further promote the integration of the different research fields, fostering interdisciplinarity and transfer of research methods between different experimental systems. Accordingly, the majority of the sessions will be organized to include speakers from different fields (microbial/plant biology and biomedical research). (2) To promote integration of early career scientists into the community, by reserving 30- 40% of the speaker slots to early career scientists and 12 ?poster preview? talks, selected from poster presentations. The formal scientific program, limited attendance and organized but informal opportunities for interaction will make this meeting a ?must go? conference, promoting deeper understanding of the biosynthesis and physiological roles of carotenoids in living organisms and human health."
"9414635","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of cancer cells rely on a specific type of metabolism characterized by a high level of glycolysis occurring in aerobic conditions and leading to a high amount of lactate production. This so-called Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis is also observed during specific stages of embryonic development such as the preimplantation embryo, or in embryonic stem cells. The physiological significance of this unusual type of energy metabolism during development and in cancer is not understood. Our preliminary observations in mouse and chicken embryos indicate that precursor cells of muscles and vertebrae exhibit aerobic glycolysis with high levels of lactate production much as is observed in cancer cells. Skeletal muscles and vertebrae derive from an embryonic tissue called paraxial mesoderm, which is produced as the body axis forms by posterior elongation. One striking characteristic of the paraxial mesoderm is it segmentation into repeated structures called somites that give rise to the vertebrae and associated structures. While aerobic glycolysis is often considered to be associated to fast proliferating cells, the situation appears more complex as in the paraxial mesoderm, only cells experiencing high levels of Wnt and FGF signaling exhibit aerobic glycolysis.  Blocking glycolysis in developing chicken embryos leads to axis truncation as is observed in the Wnt or FGF pathway mutants. In the posterior paraxial mesoderm, FGF signaling controls glycolysis which in turn controls Wnt signaling. In this project, we propose to explore in detail the role of energy metabolism in the control of body formation and segmentation in vivo in chicken embryos and also in vitro in mouse and human pluripotent cells differentiated toward a paraxial mesoderm fate. More specifically, we want to characterize the aerobic glycolysis taking place in the posterior paraxial mesoderm to see how it relates to the Warburg effect of cancer cells. The physiological significance of Warburg effect in cancer is not understood. The identification of the counterpart to this physiological state in the embryo might help shed light on the role of this particular metabolic strategy and lead to a better understanding of cancer physiology. We will also explore the crosstalk between FGF, glycolysis and Wnt signaling in the developing paraxial mesoderm, and the role of this specific type of glycolytic metabolism as an effector of signaling. Finally, we observed that inhibiting respiration blocks segmentation and we propose to take advantage of in vitro systems of the developing paraxial mesoderm that we have developed to analyze in depth the role of metabolism in the control of the oscillations of the segmentation clock. This work could shed light on the origin of segmentation defects of the vertebral column such as hemi-vertebrae in humans which have recently been proposed in some cases to be associated to hypoxia acting on the segmentation clock. Our research is expected to have a strong impact in the field of congenital spine anomalies, currently an understudied biomedical area, and will be of utility in elucidating the etiology and eventual prevention of these disorders."
"9573806","Our laboratory's long-range goal is to develop new approaches to eradicate HIV-1. Unlike most viral infections, HIV-1 is able to overcome the host innate and adaptive immune response to establish a life long infection in nearly every infected person. Moreover, standard approaches to develop vaccines have not succeeded in providing protection from initial infection and antiviral drugs have not yet provided a cure. Thus, novel approaches are needed that will more effectively counteract the unique ability of HIV-1 to establish a persistent infection in nearly every host. We expect that a greater understanding of viral strategies will inform the design of therapeutic approaches that will result in prevention of infection, long-term remission or cure. As the next step towards this goal, the objective of this application is to understand how the HIV-1 accessory protein, Vpr, allows HIV-1 to evade innate immune responses. We have shown that Vpr counteracts a macrophage-specific Env degradation pathway in primary monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) and MDM-T cell co-cultures and that Vpr limits induction of interferon (IFN) gene expression following infection. Determining how Vpr evades these responses will provide crucial knowledge that may reveal approaches that will help clear infection. To accomplish this goal, we will test our central hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this application by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Identify the IFN-induced macrophage-specific restriction factor that promotes Envelope degradation and (2) Determine how Vpr allows HIV to evade the innate immune response in macrophages. At the completion of these studies we expect to have identified the IFN-induced restriction factor and we expect to establish that Vpr interacts with host DNA repair proteins to limit sensing of DNA intermediates and innate immune responses in MDM. These outcomes are expected to have an important contribution to the field by identifying the pathways that are most important to target for anti-HIV drug development."
"9416612","Project Summary/Abstract: Role of O-GlcNAc Transferase-Mediated Innate Immune Response in Colonic Inflammation and Tumorigenesis Ulcerative colitis is a common form of inflammatory bowel disease that affects about 1 person per 600 in the U.S. Patients suffering from colitis demonstrate a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). A common feature of colitis and CRC is enhanced activation of immune signaling and inflammatory cytokine production. Studies of immune system metabolism (immunometabolism) in recent years have identified a tight link between metabolic reprogramming and inflammation. It has been shown that activation of immune cells is accompanied by robust metabolic changes towards increased glucose utilization. However, the role of individual glucose metabolism pathways in colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis remains unknown. The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is a unique glucose metabolism pathway that leads to the generation of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). O-linked GlcNAc (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is a key enzyme that utilizes UDP-GlcNAc to modify its target proteins, a process called O-GlcNAcylation. In this Proposal, we aim to study the role of O-GlcNAc signaling in innate immune activation of colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis. Our preliminary studies revealed increased OGT and decreased cullin 3 (Cul3) E3 ubiquitin ligase expression in inflamed colon tissue during chemically-induced colitis. Deletion of OGT or Cul3 in myeloid cells attenuated or exacerbated disease severity during colitis, respectively. The underlying mechanism may involve O-GlcNAcylation-mediated inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a central transcription factor in the regulation of intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis. Through microarray and biochemical analyses, our recent study (JEM, In Press) identified Cul3 as a negative regulator of OGT expression and STAT3 O-GlcNAcylation by inhibiting nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Our studies further revealed lysine-63 (K63)-linked ubiquitination of OGT mediated by TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating immune signaling. Based on the known effects of STAT3 in colitis and CRC, and the well-established cross-regulation between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, we propose that altered signaling through a Cul3-OGT axis leading to aberrant STAT3 O- GlcNAcylation plays an essential role in innate immune activation during colitis and associated colon cancer. We hypothesize that 1) increased OGT expression and STAT3 O-GlcNAcylation in myeloid cells exacerbates colonic inflammation and inflammation-driven colon cancer; 2) myeloid-derived Cul3 negatively regulates OGT expression and promotes activation of a STAT3-IL-10 axis; and 3) TRAF6-mediated OGT K63 ubiquitination is important for STAT3 O-GlcNAcylation. We will employ both a chemically-induced model and the IL-10 deficiency model in mice to investigate acute colitis and inflammation-driven colon cancer. It is our expectation that this work will bring about a better understanding of metabolic regulation of intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis and contribute to the generation of new strategies for the treatment of these diseases."
"9486327","PROJECT SUMMARY ? PROJECT 1  Consistent with the aims of the OPAL center, this project will explore adaptations of treatments for schizophrenia, with the goal of optimizing their effectiveness in real-world clinical settings and readiness for broad deployment. Schizophrenia is associated with cognitive deficits that negatively impact essential areas of daily functioning. NY State Office of Mental Health (OMH) is the first and largest state system of care to implement a statewide program of cognitive remediation (CR), an evidence-based practice for improving cognition and aiding functional recovery. Through Cognitive Remediation to Promote Recovery (CR2PR), CR is now offered in outpatient programs, with plans to expand to more services and further adapt implementation to improve treatment outcomes. This project will work directly with OMH clinics and clinicians, and draw on the resources of the Center's trans-disciplinary expertise to build upon and improve current CR delivery methods.  This project will study the impact of two adaptations. One adaptation focuses on increasing the accessibility of the program, which participants report is limited by the requirement of twice weekly attendance. This project will therefore compare the feasibility and acceptability of delivering CR in either two clinic-based sessions (Clinic) or one clinic and one remote session (Hybrid) per week. Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted with stakeholders to explore the impact of the adaptation. The second adaptation is intended to improve personalization of CR by systematically accounting for individual differences in neurocognitive needs. Drawing upon convergent evidence for tailoring CR based on need for early auditory processing (EAP) training, this project examines whether integrating a measure of EAP into the current baseline assessment facilitates personalization of the menu of restorative computer-based exercises used in CR. The team's expertise in CR implementation and dissemination, clinical trials, and integrative quantitative and qualitative methods altogether support the aims of this project. Feasibility parameters and qualitative/quantitative data analyses of facilitators and barriers to Hybrid CR delivery will together inform further treatment refinement and the design of a larger effectiveness trial of Clinic versus Hybrid CR. We will study how EAP assessment is employed by practitioners to personalize the CR treatment plan and examine if EAP improvement is associated with cognitive outcomes in public practice CR settings. Finally we will compare cognitive, functional, and service use outcomes in Hybrid versus Clinic CR and use exploratory methods to test whether subgroups of patients benefit more from Hybrid or Clinic delivery approaches. This project supports the mission of the Center, to rapidly translate laboratory evidence to clinical practice in a manner congruent with the realities of publically funded clinics. By improving CR utilization and treatment outcomes in large systems of care, this project has the potential to impact the lives of many people with schizophrenia."
"9494076","PROJECT SUMMARY: ?A BIODESIGN PROGRAM IN REAHABILITATION ENGINEERING? The development of ?A Biodesign Program in Rehabilitation Engineering? structured to train interdisciplinary undergraduate students in the design, innovation and commercialization of assistive and rehabilitative medical devices for the disabled is proposed here. With a substantial disabled population (one in five in some states) in the United States and an emerging amputee (~12000) and geriatric population (~ 3.3 million) in Florida alone, smart and effective assistive and rehabilitative devices that can impact the lives of the disabled are imperative in the current biomedical devices market. We propose to team teach rehabilitation engineering design through an experiential and meticulous teaching model which includes four stages: Inspire, Identify, Invent and Implement. We believe that the University's optimal location, supporting environment and infrastructure, partnerships with the medical community, extensive network of industry representatives and excellence in online education will all serve as precursors for the success of the proposed training program. The proposed Biodesign program is designed as a sequence of two courses with an intermediate clinical immersion and spans across four semesters of the junior and senior years of undergraduate students in different engineering disciplines and in the biomedical sciences discipline. The program presents a plan to integrate physical therapy doctoral students in the Biodesign capstone process. The multi-disciplinary teaching team involves engineering faculty and clinical faculty from the College of Engineering and Computer Science, College of Medicine, College of Health and Public Affairs and from UCF partners such as the Orlando VA Medical Center and mentors and industry experts from the UCF Business Incubator and UCF ICorps Teams. The Biodesign program plans to inspire and introduce students to the cutting edge advances in the field of rehabilitative science and engineering through an introductory course in the spring semester of the junior year, which is followed by a six-week summer clinical immersion where student teams identify unmet user-oriented needs through clinical rotations organized in rehabilitation facilities at medical centers, prosthetics clinics, physical therapy, internal medicine and sports medicine clinics. In the following fall and spring semesters of the senior year, student teams pursue the identified design problems from the summer immersion in a two- semester long capstone design course defining the invent and implement stages of the program. Extensive training on device commercialization and business planning is integrated into the design innovation and implementation phases of the program. The program concludes with a summer mentoring to nurture entrepreneurial dreams and academic research aspirations of students completing the program. The long term objectives of the program are: to inspire students in the field of rehabilitation engineering, to enhance team-based design education through a novel mixed-mode teaching model, to contribute to a broad community of disabled individuals and to promote collaborative and inter-disciplinary education and research."
"9654988","PROJECT SUMMARY Ewing sarcoma is a rare tumor that occurs in children and young adults. While Ewing sarcoma is relatively rare, the biology of this disease is also relevant to non-Ewing sarcomas, and to other cancer subtypes, due to the presence of the EWS/FLI translocation, the driving event in this disease. Similar translocations involving ETS transcription factors occur in other malignancies, including prostate cancer. Thus, understanding the biology of Ewing sarcoma may provide insight into many cancer types. We will investigate the role of secondary genetic events in the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma. These secondary events have been identified through next-generation sequencing of primary tumors and cell lines. Specifically, we will evaluate the role of STAG2 in mediating epigenetic and transcriptional changes induced by the driving oncogene in Ewing sarcoma, EWS/FLI. In Aim 1, we will use genomic approaches (RNAseq, ChIPseq, WGS, etc.) to assess the mechanistic role of STAG2 in the regulation of chromatin architecture, transcription, and aneuploidy in Ewing cells. In Aim 2, we will study the role of STAG2 in progression, maintenance and metastasis in Ewing sarcoma, using functional studies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In Aim 3, we will determine whether there is a synthetic lethal dependency on STAG1 when STAG2 is absent in Ewing sarcoma cells. Our central hypothesis is that STAG2 loss plays a key role in the epigenetic reprogramming that drives the oncogenic function of EWS/FLI."
"9523126","Project Summary Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from stress-related affective disorders, and as a result, are also at a greater risk of developing comorbid cardiovascular disease. This proposal investigates the estrogen (E)- mediated neural mechanisms that we suggest are initiated in the central amygdala (CeA) to promote innate stress vulnerability to both the emergence of negative valence and exaggerated cardiac sympathetic activation. The proposed series of studies relies on the use of a witness stress paradigm whereby a male or female rodent is located in a protected region of a dominant resident's cage and witnesses a social conflict between the resident and a smaller male intruder. Following stress exposure, females with either intact ovarian hormones, or ovariectomized with E replacement (OVX+E) exhibit negative valence (decreased sucrose preference, increased burying) and exaggerated cardiac sympathetic levels (elevated resting blood pressure) while OVX with vehicle replacement (OVX+V) and intact males are resilient, making this model ideal to study the role of estrogen on increased stress susceptibility. Aim 1 expands upon preliminary data that support the hypothesis that ovarian hormones, in particular E, exacerbate stress susceptibility. These studies will identify sex differences and estrogenic effects on behavioral and sympathetic indices of stress-related pathology. Aim 2 utilizes direct intra-CeA administration of an E receptor (ER) agonist (DPN) or antagonist (PHTPP), to activate or block, respectively, the ERs in the CeA. We hypothesize that inhibiting the ER in this brain region will enhance stress resiliency in the innate susceptible (intact-cycling) and induced susceptible (OVX+E) female groups, while activating the receptor will promote vulnerability in the induced resilient group (OVX). One known effect of E is its ability to increase the stress-related neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a peptide that is abundant in the CeA and is capable of inducing enhanced behavioral and sympathetic fear responses. Our data indicate that intact females exhibit increased CRF in the CeA, but only if they have a history of stress exposure. Therefore, Aim 2 will also identify if these ER treatments affect CRF expression in the CeA. Finally, Aim 3 will use virus-mediated gene transfer to reduce CRF levels in the CeA to determine whether the susceptibility-enhancing effects of the E are dependent upon CRF. Moreover, using in vivo microdialysis, studies in Aim 3 will identify whether increased CRF in the CeA has consequences on the major stress sensitive target the locus coeruleus (LC). CRF release and neuronal activity will be measured in the LC during stress/control and will identify if intact females exhibit increased CRF release in the LC and whether this translates to elevated activity. The ability of shRNA CRF knockdown in the CeA to affect LC activity and CRF release will also be assessed. Together, these studies will provide evidence of a targeted mechanism increasing susceptibility to affective disorders and comorbid cardiac dysfunction in females. These studies propose a novel and ?translatable? pathway by which E may regulate innate stress vulnerability in women."
"9396427","Project Abstract/Summary1  Family-based research has established a foundational understanding that parenting practices facilitate school readiness (e.g., child social skills, academic competence).1?3 This evidence has been used to develop prevention programs that facilitate successful entry into formal schooling.4?8 However, prevention programs focused on school readiness are not universally effective.7,9?12 Programs must account for multiple contextual factors that shape the development of social skills and academic competence (e.g., child characteristics, parent?child interactions, peer relationships) and include genetic influences to be effective.13 Genetically informed designs have the potential to contribute to the development of effective prevention programs by providing information about the distinct genetic and environmental influences on child development in two majors ways. The first is by accounting for genetically influenced child characteristics that have been shown to moderate the effectiveness of prevention programs.14?16 Social skills,17 academic competence,18 parent?child relationships,19,20 and peer relationships21?23?all critical to school readiness?have known genetic influences. The second is by accounting for genetically influenced characteristics that have been found to evoke responses from parents and peers and influence the peers children select.24?33 The activities in this application will disentangle genetic and environmental influences on children?s positive parent and peer relationships and apply these findings to an existing prevention program. Analysis of a longitudinal prospective adoption design will clarify gene?environment interplay by examining (1) the extent to which positive parent and peer relationships are child, parent, or peer driven; (2) the extent to which genetic influences on child characteristics affect positive parent and peer relationships; and (3) how positive relationships affect later social skills and academic competence. Findings from the first study will then be used to formulate hypotheses for the second study. This translational approach will use an existing randomized prevention program to test whether child characteristics and/or positive relationships (previously identified as genetically and/or environmentally influenced) serve as mechanisms of change for the development of social skills and academic competence. Advanced longitudinal analytic strategies, including structural equation modeling and complier average causal effect, will be used to achieve the proposed aims. The interdisciplinary approach of this proposed study will refine a conceptual model that integrates genetic and environmental influences on child characteristics, parent?child relationships, peer relationships, and child social and academic development. The proposed work will also provide training in child development, gene?environment interplay, translation of findings to prevention science, and prevention methodology. As such, it will facilitate my long-term goal of using a developmentally sensitive and genetically informed framework that can be translated to prevention science to elucidate salient mechanisms to develop, adapt, and evaluate future prevention programs."
"9396773","PROJECT SUMMARY While much is known about the maintenance of information in working memory (WM), how we prioritize information in WM, and how prioritization changes representations of uncertainty, remain unexplored. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem because a host of psychiatric and neurologic disorders stems from a primary WM dysfunction. The long-term goal of this work is to understand how neural architectures place limits on WM representations. The overall objective of the proposed research is to test a probabilistic population coding model for how neural activity patterns carry information about WM uncertainty, and elucidate how a network of interacting brain regions sculpt WM representations to satisfy task demands, which is the next step towards my long-term goal. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that noisy neural activity patterns encode a probability distribution over feature values, whereby greater width of the distribution reflects greater uncertainty about a remembered stimulus feature, and that executive control processes can dynamically prioritize items in WM by sculpting their neural activity pattern to reduce uncertainty. The rationale for the proposed research is that, as we better understand neural constraints limiting WM behavior, a theoretical framework will emerge that can enable strategies for understanding, diagnosing, and treating cognitive dysfunction. Across two specific aims, this research will test the hypotheses that: (1) prioritized items in spatial WM are represented in neural population activity patterns consistent with decreased uncertainty and (2) topographic maps of retinotopic space in frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex, along with non-topographic executive control regions of frontal cortex, contain graded representations of behavioral priority and WM contents. Pariticipants will remember multiple items in visual spatial WM, each assigned different behavioral priority values. Neural activity patterns measured using functional MRI will be used to infer representations of feature values in WM, as well as representations of their uncertainty using a Bayesian generative model of neural activation. Additionally, causal experiments using TMS stimulation and parallel studies in patients with focal lesions to visual, parietal, and frontal cortical regions with topographic maps of space will be conducted to determine the relative role of each region in representing and prioritizing information in WM and its uncertainty. Overall, the proposed work will produce data necessary for testing theories relating neural activity patterns to representations of WM uncertainty across behavioral priority conditions, and the causal involvement of different regions in prioritized WM behavior. The proposed research will be significant because it will uncover how neural representations of uncertainty guide behavior, and how behavioral priority can optimize neural representations of remembered information."
"9461676","Previous neuroimaging research suggests that age-related decline in the functioning of specific neural systems contributes to decline in cognitive performance, even in the absence of significant disease. Previous imaging studies, however, have typically focused on the magnitude of mean activation, rather than functional connectivity (FC) of activated regions, and have relied on extreme-group designs comparing younger and older adults. Building on the findings from the previous project period, we propose to investigate age-related differences in visual attention with a multimodal imaging methodology comprising both resting-state and task- related FC, as well as white matter integrity as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Each of four experiments will include 90 healthy, community-dwelling adults sampled continuously across the age range of 18-79 years. Critically, the research will use graph theoretical analyses of structural connectivity (SC) and FC, which will provide a unifying methodology and specific metrics (e.g., strength of FC within and between network modules) that can be applied to both structural and functional imaging.  Each of the four experiments will involve a visual search task, and behavioral assessments of visual search performance will implement a mathematical model of reaction time that yields separate parameter estimates for the rate of information accumulation towards a decision (drift rate), as distinct from visual encoding and response execution processes (nondecision time). We propose to elicit differential engagement of functional modules, by varying the attentional demands of the search task related to: the enhancement of target information versus suppression of irrelevant but salient information (Exp. 1), the spatial selectivity of attention (Exp. 2), the activation of a motor response (Exp. 3), and the response to visually degraded targets (Exp. 4).  Graph theoretical analyses of the structural and functional imaging data will test the overall scientific premise of this project: that aging is associated with a shift in the dynamic balance of within-module and between-module task-related FC (Aim 1), that this pattern is related to the degradation of visual information as reflected in SC and FC of visual sensory regions (Aim 2), and that task-related FC will reflect the participation of specific modules as a function of attentional task demands (Aim 3). We expect an age-related decline in the graph theoretical measures of within-module connectivity, but an increase with age in measures of between- module connectivity. Further, we hypothesize that the increase in between-module FC with age will be more prominent during task performance, relative to a resting-state, reflecting older adults? increased reliance on top- down attention to support task performance. The four studies and associated network analyses, with healthy adults, are designed to improve current theories of neurocognitive aging and provide information relevant for diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease."

"9619130","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic islet transplantation (Tx) has a lifesaving potential for Type 1 diabetes patients. However, even with introduction of the immunosuppressive regimen known as Edmonton Protocol, insulin independence was only transient in most recipients due to significant islet loss that starts early after the procedure. Allogeneic immune rejection, one of the major reasons for islet death, requires permanent use of immunosuppressive drugs, which are toxic to islets and cause serious side effects including cancer and infection. Moreover, in addition to its significant short and long-term side effects, there is direct evidence that immunosuppression leads to reemergence of autoreactivity, the condition that Tx is supposed to treat. New strategies to reduce the dose of immunosuppression by providing alternative defense approaches to transplanted islets are urgently needed. RNA interference is a technique that offers great potential for therapeutic gene silencing and could be employed for improving islet graft resistance to damaging factors after transplantation. We have previously demonstrated the utility of siRNA-conjugated iron oxide-based magnetic nanoparticle (MN) probes for siRNA delivery to pancreatic islets prior to transplantation in immunodeficient rodents. siRNA directed towards genes responsible for islet damage silenced these genes and provided islet protection prior to transplantation. By the use of a magnetic reporter, labeled pancreatic islets could be monitored after transplantation by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These preliminary studies in rodents showed significant improvement in graft outcome after the silencing of genes responsible for apoptosis and immune rejection. In this application we propose to extend these studies to the next level and investigate the effectiveness of MN-siRNA in a pre- clinical immunocompetent non-human primate model of islet transplantation. The experimental design will include synthesis of the MN-siRNA probes targeting caspase-3, caspase-8, Fas and beta2-microglobulin genes, which will then be incubated with pancreatic islets. This will lead to mRNA silencing and simultaneous magnetic labeling of islet cells. Allogeneic islets pre-incubated with these MN-siRNA probe(s) will be transplanted into diabetic baboons that will be monitored long-term using magnetic resonance imaging while tapering immunosupression. In vivo MRI will allow us to follow graft outcome and compare it with non- manipulated control grafts. We anticipate that siRNA treatment of the islets will allow for significant improvement in long-term graft outcome and reduction of the effective dose of immunosupressants. Due to the module design of the nanoparticles siRNA molecules to additional targets can be introduced if necessary."
"9525874","7. Project Summary/Abstract  The class of prenylated indole alkaloids known as the ambiguines represents a structurally intriguing class of compounds with interesting biological activity including promising antibiotic and anti-fungal properties. Ambiguine E is arguably the most potent of these natural products with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus comparable to that of the FDA approved antibiotic gentamicin (1.5 and 1.4 ?g/mL respectively). Perhaps a more fascinating feature of these natural products is their biosynthesis, which is suggested to involve the class of non-heme C?H functionalizing enzymes known as the Rieske-oxygenases. It has been proposed that these enzymes are responsible for the final oxidative diversification among the ambiguines including cyclization, epoxidation, and dihydroxylation. In addition, a novel class of non-heme C?H chlorinating enzymes have been identified as responsible for a late-stage stereoselective sp3 chlorination leading to the chlorine-containing ambiguine natural products. While a synthesis of tetracyclic (+)-ambiguine H was recently reported by Baran and coworkers, a synthesis of any of the pentacyclic ambiguines has not yet been accomplished. We envision that a divergent total synthesis of these densely functionalized indole alkaloids will help elucidate mechanisms for the final Rieske mediated oxidations in addition to exploring the promiscuity of the C?H chlorinating enzymes. In light of this goal, we have completed a synthesis of the pentacyclic core of the ambiguines utilizing a novel strategy in a four-step sequence. The completion of the natural products and subsequent biosynthetic studies are proposed here.  "
"9572644","Project Summary/Abstract  This application seeks funding to purchase an Illumina MiSeq system. This instrument is a cutting- edge, next generation benchtop DNA sequencer that will support studies of the gut microbiome by our VA funded investigators. The MiSeq system includes integrated software for automated generation of DNA clonal clusters by bridge amplification, sequencing, primary and secondary analysis. The system includes an embedded touchscreen monitor and on-instrument computer, dual surface imaging capability, MiSeq Software Suite, installation kits and standards, installation and training, and 12 months warranty (including parts and labor). The MiSeq system is capable of generating up to 15 Gb per run using Nextera kits in combination with Illumina's validated TruSeq chemistry. The instrument footprint requires less than 2 square feet of benchtop space and is a stand-alone instrument that does not need dedicated ancillary amplification or computing/IT input. Metagenomic surveys of microbial populations are performed using the prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, which contains conserved and variable regions that facilitate sequencing and phylogenetic classification of the gut microbiome. Using the MiSeq system, 16S metagenomics studies can achieve bacterial species-level identification efficiently. The MiSeq system will allow expansion of ongoing and currently funded research on the following projects of our 5 major users: 1) The Kuhn lab is studying the role of serotonin in the non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and it was recently demonstrated that the gut microbiome plays a very critical role in the development of this neurodegenerative disorder. Studies of the gut microbiome in a mouse model that lacks brain serotonin (developed in the Kuhn lab for these studies) will add a new dimension to this project; 2) the Majumdar lab is studying colorectal cancer and how alterations in the gut microbiome can define racial disparities in this malignancy. Dr. Majumdar has carried out limited sequencing of the human gut microbiome already and the MiSeq system will allow his lab to expand these interesting studies in Veterans with colorectal cancer; 3) the Kowluru lab is studying diabetes and the islet cells function. In light of emerging work that has demonstrated that the pathological path followed by diabetes is significantly influenced by the gut microbiome, Dr. Kowluru will use the MiSeq to study how currently used therapeutics for diabetes changes the gut microbiome and improves outcomes: 4) The Mateika lab is studying the role of serotonin in respiratory function in spinal cord injury. A single published paper has recently suggested that spinal cord injury causes a significant alteration in the gut microbiome and Dr. Mateika will study how respiratory and sleep alterations associated with spinal cord injury are modulated by the gut microbiome; and 5) the Rishi lab is studying new therapeutics for the treatment of malignancies and a very recent publication revealed that cancer cell resistance to selected chemotherapeutics is mediated by specific bacteria in the gut microbiome. Dr. Rishi's research is focusing on cancer cell multidrug resistance using in vivo models. With the MiSeq system, the Rishi lab will be able to expand its approach to the study of cancer treatment. Together, these five investigators study some of the most prevalent clinical conditions affecting Veterans (i.e., Parkinson's disease, diabetes/obesity, cancer and spinal cord injury). Emerging studies are showing clearly that these same diseases are significantly modulated by the gut microbiome. The ability of our investigators to carry out 16S rRNA sequencing in their studies will not only add new and innovative dimensions to the individual projects, it will also enhance our ability to translate these findings to the clinic and improve the health care delivered to our Veterans."
"9606567","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABC transporters govern distribution of drugs, lipids, and peptides throughout the human body and play a critical role in multidrug resistance. This proposal aims to understand the entire transport cycle of an ABC transporter and identify rules governing how different ABC transporters select substrates by using a powerful combination approach combining x-ray crystallography and cryo electron microscopy. The approach outlined here examines the mechanistic cycle of an ABC transporter, from substrate binding to conformational changes using a cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) approach that has yielded an unprecedented subnanometer resolution structure of an ABC transporter in a collaboration Dr. Tomasiak was part of with Dr. Yifan Cheng. The ultimate goal is a comprehensive model of several human transporters to reveal a quantitative model of human pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics that will give a clearer understanding of how these biologically critical molecules are distributed. The candidate, Thomas Tomasiak, has an interest to use the K99 to launch an independent career weaving several biological disciplines and approaches to studying distribution of drugs, lipids, and other hydrophobic compounds. Dr. Tomasiak hopes to become an innovate assistant professor at a leading institution, contributing to our knowledge of drug disposition and multidrug resistance in microbial pathogenesis and cancer. This proposal is centered on a training program in cryo-EM that will help Dr. Tomasiak become an expert in this field and combine it with his background in x-ray crystallography. The combination of membrane protein crystallography and cryo-EM will make a powerful hybrid approach to answer biological questions concerning conformational state changes and complexes in membrane proteins difficult for either technique alone. Part of the proposed research is in development of new tools for the validation of structural models from cryo-EM. The proposal is designed to supplement Thomas's training by integrating his current knowledge of membrane proteins and x-ray crystallography with the burgeoning field of cryo-electron microscopy. Dr. Tomasiak's mentor, Dr. Stroud, and co-mentor, Dr. Cheng are internationally recognized in their fields and Dr. Stroud has supported numerous postdoctoral researchers into the transition to independence. In addition to the co-mentors, Dr. Tomasiak has assembled an advisory committee of senior scientists who will be able to help guide his research and are ideally situated to guide his career progression to an independent position."
"9461979","Project Summary/Abstract  Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality however few effective therapies exist. Treatment is limited to surgical or percutaneous revascularization, which provides modest benefit without improving long-term outcomes. PAD may present as either intermittent claudication (IC), with exertion-induced pain, or as critical limb ischemia (CLI), defined by rest pain or tissue necrosis. While CLI was historically believed to represent the natural progression from IC in patients with PAD, CLI and IC are now understood to be distinct phenotypic manifestations of PAD driven by genetic susceptibility to ischemic tissue necrosis. Identifying factors that predispose to the development of CLI will be critical to reducing morbidity, mortality, and health care costs however the specific mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to tissue necrosis remain unclear. The long-term goal of our research is to determine the mechanisms by which CLI develops and to identify potential therapeutic targets for this disease. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the mechanism by which endogenous muscle progenitor cells provide an adaptive response to ischemia and limit tissue necrosis.  While the vast majority of studies investigating PAD focus on the contribution of the vasculature to this process, our lab has demonstrated that skeletal muscle, and endogenous muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) in particular, serves as a key determinant in the development of tissue necrosis in response to limb ischemia. Preliminary studies using a murine model of subacute hind limb ischemia (HLI) have suggested that ablation of MPCs results in severe tissue necrosis even in typically necrosis-resistant strains of mice and that MPCs incorporate into new blood vessels in response to ischemia. Taken together, these findings suggest a model in which MPCs incorporate into neovessels in order to support tissue perfusion while also directly contributing to muscle regeneration. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that endogenous muscle progenitor cells mediate both skeletal muscle neovascularization and myofiber regeneration in response to ischemia. The specific aims of this proposal are:  1. Define the role of MPCs in skeletal muscle myofiber regeneration and neovascularization in  response to ischemia  2. Characterize the number and function of MPCs in patients with CLI and IC  These experiments will improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which vascular disease develops and provide novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, the skills I will acquire during this fellowship will help to establish me as an independent investigator and a surgeon-scientist focused on the development of translational PAD therapies."
"9539849","PROJECT SUMMARY Influenza infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. About a third of influenza transmission occurs within households, with household members of infected persons at highest risk of becoming infected. Better understanding of the patterns and timing of influenza infection within households is important to guide policies to prevent and control influenza during both seasonal epidemics and in the event of a pandemic. The aim of this project is to estimate the infection risk and factors associated with infection and transmission among household contacts of persons with confirmed influenza infection. Persons with confirmed influenza infection (index cases) will be identified through ongoing studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness among patients with medically-attended acute respiratory illness of ?7 days duration. Index cases and their household contacts will be eligible for this study if there is at least one other person in the index case?s household and the first person in the household with onset of respiratory illness was in the household in the past 10 days (of study enrollment). Eligible household will have two scheduled home visits (first visit within 2 days of notification of positive results and second visit 5 days after the first visit) and a follow-up phone call. Trained research staff will obtain nasal and throat swabs from all consenting household contacts during the home visits and administer a brief questionnaire to assess demographics, general health status, onset and presence of respiratory symptoms, and relevant exposures. The follow-up call will assess illness resolution and impact on daily activities in ill participants. Influenza immunization status will be determined by a validated immunization registry. The combined nasal and throat swabs from each home visit will be tested for influenza using RT-PCR. Annual risk of secondary transmission in households will be calculated for different age groups and influenza subtypes when possible. Household serial intervals and duration of infectiousness will be estimated using transmission models. Data will be provided to CDC for combined analyses of other participating sites. Respiratory specimens from household transmission pairs will be sent to CDC for genetic characterization and analysis of influenza viral evolution."
"9555296","Project summary: This project is designed to evaluate a new class of anti-cancer agents for treatment of invasive melanoma, pancreas, lung, and colon carcinomas. The study compounds are small, synthetic molecules that have not previously been used in people, and bind to a surface receptor on tumor cells that has not previously been targeted in cancer. Strong preliminary results indicate that the study compounds potentiate the efficacy of the new immune checkpoint inhibitors that are now the standard of care for metastatic melanoma. In this proposal, we will determine dosing regimens that will maximize the anti-cancer effects, define biomarkers that correlate with tumor response, and determine whether the anti-melanoma synergy between G-1 and ?PD-1 extends to other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Completion of the proposed work will contribute to the completion of IND-enabling work necessary to translate these discoveries to first in human trials."
"9404041","Secure and Private Collaborative Environments for Biomedical Analytics Privacy and confidentiality are critical to healthcare. However, preserving privacy is a non-trivial task because any protection scheme essentially involves a tradeoff with data utility. Furthermore, lack of access to biomedical data can lead to fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, higher safety risk from avoidable drug interactions side-effects, and is a significant impediment to biomedical research. The primary aim of this project is to facilitate biomedical research in collaborative environments by developing technologies for secure and privacy-preserving exploratory analysis. This is critical to the big data to knowledge (BD2K) initiative since it can facilitate biomedical research in collaborative environments. The proposed work addresses two complementary aims. First, we will develop technologies that enable exploratory analysis of data to determine its usability and relevance to the specific biomedical research task. We will also develop technologies to enable the measurement and mitigation of additional privacy/security risk due to accessing this data, thus enabling proper control over the data. The proposed solutions will utilize and enhance the state of the art technological solutions such as privacy-preserving sampling and analysis algorithms, risk-based access control, and query auditing. By doing so, the proposed work will enhance biomedical study design, exploratory data analysis, and hypothesis discovery without compromising on privacy. The project will result in open-source, freely available software tools to perform utility analysis and risk analysis. These will be integrated into REDCap, a data collection and management system used widely for providing translational research informatics support. Several ongoing projects at Rutgers and UCSD will serve as initial pilot customers for the proposed work, with other research groups also being involved at a later stage."
"9443680","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Observational learning, defined as learning by observing others' actions, is a fundamental behavior of human and animals and is impaired in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). How the neurons and circuits in the brain accomplish this remarkable function is unknown. In observational learning, the observer needs to actively understand and store others' actions from his own personnel perspective, and then utilize the information in later self-actions. This proposal studies the role of hippocampal neurons in this process of action understanding and how they mediate the learning effect of observation. We will test a hypothesis that observing others' actions triggers the hippocampal neuronal activity patterns that encode the observer's own execution of the same actions. According to the hypothesis, observation leads to learning by facilitating and strengthening the activity patterns encoding self-actions. Our main approach is to simultaneously record a large number of neurons in freely moving rats performing observational tasks. We will determine what activity patterns occur during observation and how they compare with the patterns during the observer's own actions. We will then determine whether the observation-induced activity patterns enhance the observer's learning behavior and whether the disruption of these patterns reduces the enhancement. In addition, we will determine whether the observation-induced neural activity patterns and their learning effects are impaired in a transgenic rat model with social dysfunction. The outcome of this proposal may reveal a novel neural circuit mechanism of observational learning and generate insights into how observational learning is impaired in ASDs at the neural circuit level in vivo."
"9442820","PROJECT SUMMARY Every year, more than 500,000 patients in the US have coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) to treat coronary artery disease. However, postoperative outcomes are complicated by a significant incidence of stroke and cognitive impairment. Postoperative cognitive impairment results in decreased quality of life for these individuals and higher hospital readmission rates. There is a clear unmet medical need to find treatments to attenuate or prevent cardiac disease and CABG induced cognitive impairment. Although the precise triggers are debated, CABG increases brain hypoxia and circulating cytokines. Increases in circulating inflammatory cytokines and brain hypoxia result in increased brain reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, activation of brain inflammatory pathways leading to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Recent work by our group and others have shown in animals that Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7) can inhibit ROS production, increase nitric oxide production and reduce inflammatory cytokines in the brain, microvasculature and peripheral tissue via activation of the Mas receptor. The ideal therapeutic candidate to treat CABG induced cognitive impairment would be designed to interrupt this cascade by working at both sides of the blood-brain barrier, the brain vascular endothelium and neuronal cells. Ang-(1-7) meets these criteria because Ang-(1-7), acting at the Mas receptor, is known to have anti-inflammatory effects at both endothelial cells and neurons. In Q2 2014, we received regulatory support from the NHLBI SMARTT program to submit an IND to the FDA for the use of Ang-(1-7) to treat cognitive impairment in CABG patients and this IND was approved in August 2015. The present UO1 application is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ang-(1-7) to enhance cognitive function in participants undergoing CABG surgery. Further, by teaming with the unique capabilities of the NIH Clinical Center, these studies will measure, for the first time, post CABG surgery brain inflammation and microglia activation as measured by PET imaging of [11C]PBR28 and the test the hypothesis that Ang-(1- 7) will result in a decrease in brain inflammation and microglia activation in CABG patients. When completed, this clinical study will have advanced development of a new therapy with potential to treat cognitive impairment in CABG patients."
"9460016","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon guidance is a critical step in the development of the central nervous system. Mounting evidence suggests that axon guidance is disrupted in many patients suffering from several neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. The guidance cue netrin-1 and netrin receptor DCC regulate axon guidance by modulating the growth cone cytoskeleton, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. We recently identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM9 as a novel binding partner of DCC and a regulator of axon guidance and the cytoskeleton. We also have preliminary data showing that the highly similar protein TRIM67 interacts with DCC and the actin regulatory protein VASP, and is necessary for netrin-dependent axon branching. This proposal will test our hypothesis that TRIM9 and TRIM67 coordinate to regulate the downstream effects of netrin-1 dependent axon guidance. Our first aim will be to identify and confirm TRIM67 direct interactions with DCC and Ena/VASP actin regulatory proteins and their colocalization at filopodia tips. Our second aim is to define the role of TRIM67 in netrin-dependent axon morphogenesis. Our third aim will focus on identifying axon guidance defects that occur upon deletion of TRIM67 in vitro, using novel microfluidic devices, as well as defects that occur in vivo using histological analysis. These experiments will help to further elucidate mechanisms of neuronal development."
"9554759","Project Summary/Abstract Crude mortality has been used by the public health community as a cornerstone for defining a public health emergency. Typically mortality in emergencies is monitored by surveillance processes that are incomplete or surveys which are often done poorly and ignored where that is politically expedient. This project will attempt to establish two different techniques, both simpler than surveys, and less likely to be dismissed by critics. 1) The process of multiple source triangulation, or establishing the sensitivity of IDP and death tallies will draw upon methods used widely in TB programs and the monitoring of homeless populations in large cities, but is rarely used to assess mortality. This process of constructing a summary of all known deaths or IDP's, collecting an independent sample, and examining the overlap between the two listings can be rapid, and can potentially transcend the biases typical in death and registration records. The project will select places to enumerate and measure mortality in at least one population displaced by an acute disaster, and at least one population that is persecuted or associated with significant stigma'. 2) A statistically representative community-based surveillance network was established by RHA with the Ministry of Health in Fizi Health Zone, DRC. Community health workers recorded birth, death, and migration events. Preliminary analyses suggest that the surveillance system detected 93% of births and 87% of deaths, with a specificity >99% for both measures, and positive predictive values of 98% (births) and 91% (deaths). This project will attempt to see if a similar system can be established in the city of Goma, to monitor IDPs in an urban setting. While not applicable to all crises, IDPs in Nairobi and Jordan and other large urban centers where IDPs remain stable over months or years could potentially be monitored with this approach. Once established, collection of other desired information from a statistically representative sample could easily be added into the surveillance process. To maximize policy impact, the later years of the project will involve extensive coordination with CDC, OFDA, and other donors in an attempt to establish procedures for mortality measurement in the locations and with partners of priority to donors. Without a widespread and credible capacity to measure central outcomes like income, malnutrition, and mortality, funding of humanitarian emergencies will continue to be based more on political interests than on public health need, and successful life-saving relief operations will remain indistinguishable from ineffective efforts. By adding two new simple and inexpensive options to the toolbox of the humanitarian community, we can help develop a community focused on outcomes instead of processes."
"9526699","PROJECT SUMMARY Loss of metabolic homeostasis is a hallmark of aging and many age-related chronic diseases. This is accompanied by dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics (fusion and fission) and morphology. Conversely, dietary restriction (DR), reduced food intake without malnutrition, slows aging in every organism tested thus far and protects against multiple chronic diseases, in part by maintaining metabolic health. However, cellular processes causally linking aging, DR and mitochondrial network state with aging remain unclear. Moreover, whether manipulating mitochondrial dynamics might promote healthy aging is unknown. Our long- term objective is to elucidate how DR promotes healthy aging to allow the development of novel therapeutics to treat age-related disease. Key barriers currently restricting progress on our understanding of how mitochondrial dynamics affect healthy aging are 1) a lack of non-interventional tools to study cell biology/organelle structure and function in live, multicellular animals as they age and 2) the current paradigm that specific mitochondrial states are universally ?youthful/pro-longevity? or ?aged/pro-aging?. Unpublished data from our lab challenge this paradigm: We show three conserved longevity pathways that all require mitochondrial dynamics to increase lifespan in C. elegans. Crucially however, each pathway has opposing requirements for mitochondrial network state. Here, we will develop new in vivo tools in the model organisms C. elegans to be able to fully define mitochondrial dynamic state in different tissues during normal aging and in the three pathways with differential mitochondrial requirements. Mitochondrial network state can impact multiple physiological and cellular processes including mitophagy, metabolic plasticity and inter-organelle interactions. Using C. elegans we will develop non interventional in vivo read outs of each of these outputs in a transparent multicellular organism, allowing us to define how interventions that remodel mitochondrial networks affect healthy aging."
"9443580","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural killer T (NKT) cells are an evolutionarily conserved subset of T cells that are developmentally and functionally distinct from conventional T cells. The ability to quickly secrete large quantities of a variety of cytokines upon activation enables NKT cells to be potent regulators of diverse immune responses. The deficiencies in NKT cell number and function have been linked to the development of many diseases. However, a significant gap remains in our understanding of how the development and function of NKT cells are precisely regulated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a recently discovered class of evolutionarily conserved small non-coding RNAs, negatively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes and thereby control essential biological functions and contribute to the development of many diseases. We were the first to report that the deletion of Dicer (a key enzyme for miRNA biogenesis) during hematopoiesis results in a significantly reduced NKT cell number and impaired NKT cell maturation and function, without alternating conventional T cell development in the thymus, suggesting that miRNAs are required for NKT cells. Our long-term goal is to understand how miRNAs regulate NKT cell development and function. While more than 1000 experimentally reported miRNAs, very few specific miRNAs are linked to NKT cells so far. Our objective here is to define specific miRNAs and their targets that regulate NKT cell development and function. Using miRNA arrays, we recently identified dynamic expression of miRNAs, including miR-155, and miR-17-92 cluster, during NKT cell development and activation. These findings plus our recent other reports lead to our central hypothesis that the dynamically expressed miRNAs serve as critical regulators controlling NKT cell development and function through fine-tuning specific target genes. Here we will further test this hypothesis t investigate how dynamic expression of miR-155 and miR-17-92 regulate NKT cell development and function using specific miRNA mutant mice with the gain or loss of miRNA function. The results from proposed studies may not only illuminate the new immunological and molecular mechanisms underlying NKT cell development, but may also facilitate the development of new and more efficient intervention strategies for autoimmune diseases, infection, and cancer based on the NKT cell therapy."

"9452967","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world, but, with proper treatment, blindness can be avoided in the overwhelming majority of individuals. Our long-term goal is to improve the detection of early glaucomatous damage, as well as the detection of progression of such damage. We focus in large part on damage to the macula, the most important retinal region for everyday visual activities. The lack of knowledge about the nature and prevalence of glaucomatous damage of the macula is a major barrier to progress in this field.  In Aim 1a,c, we test hypotheses about the nature of macular damage using a combination of visual field perimetry, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and a cutting-edge imaging technique, adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO). In both Aims 1b and 2a, we use AO-SLO to directly view the retinal nerve fiber (RNF) bundles so as to better understand glaucomatous damage and its progression at the level of individual RNF bundles.  A second barrier to progress in the field is the sub-optimal clinical use of OCT. We attack this barrier in 4 ways. First, as part of Aim 1b, we compare AO-SLO images to OCT scans so as to improve the clinical utility of both spectral-domain (sd) and swept-source (ss) OCT, the widely available noninvasive, clinical techniques for assessing the integrity of the RNF layer. Our working hypothesis is that OCT scans contain information about local RNF bundle damage and that this information is currently going undetected. Second, in Aim 3c, we test the hypothesis that this damage can be better visualized with an en-face analysis of OCT scans than with the commonly used RNF layer thickness analyses. Third, in Aim 2b, we test the hypothesis that we can improve the detection of glaucomatous progression by focusing on local regions of damage, as seen on OCT scans of the optic disc. Finally, in Aim 3a, we test the hypothesis that the detection of glaucomatous damage can be improved if: 1. the OCT scans are carefully examined for local defects and algorithm failures; and 2. local thinning of both RNF and retinal ganglion cell layers, as seen with OCT cube scans, are topographically compared to local loss of visual field sensitivity, as seen with standard automated perimetry. In aim 3b, we compare this approach, which can be summarized in a single page, to other methods, including current clinical methods that use commercial reports and summary statistics."
"9416608","Project Summary/Abstract: High-Throughput Screening and Computational Chemistry Core (Core 1) The objective of the High-Throughput Screening and Computational Chemistry Core (HTSCC) is to contribute to the mission of the Nebraska Center for Molecular Target Discovery and Development (MTDD) by providing the critical functional infrastructure, reagents, instrumentation, technical expertise, and training necessary for MTDD investigators to conduct their research projects. By conducting high-throughput siRNA, chemical, and virtual in silico screening experiments, investigators have a novel and powerful tool to rapidly and efficiently generate accurate information about gene pathways and functions, as well as to identify small molecule inhibitors that can serve as reversible chemical probes to dissect these signaling pathways, along with the possibility of identifying lead compounds for drug discovery. These activities are generally not practical for the individual research laboratory to carry out for reasons of cost or lack of specialized technical skills and/or equipment. For MTDD investigators interested in using HTS and high-content imaging (HCI) services, the ability to add automation, miniaturize assays, and incorporate instrumentation designed for high-throughput can greatly reduce reagent, plastic-ware, and labor costs for a vast array of screening and non-screening experimentation performed in their laboratories. An additional benefit is that the scope of investigator experimentation can be greatly broadened and performed with greater precision, typically enhancing the quality and reproducibility of data. Throughout this process, on-site staff provides expertise, training, support, and feedback in the performance of screening technologies that will minimize costs, enhance throughput, and maximize the generation of interpretable results. Moreover, the core will continually develop and implement new technologies as needed and work to obtain and/or upgrade necessary instrumentation. By these means, the core will help to make MTDD investigators more competitive for research funding and to facilitate the long- term goal of performing research that ultimately results in the improvement of the health of patients."
"9471430","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Candidate: I am an infectious diseases epidemiologist committed to reducing HIV incidence in resource- limited settings through combination HIV prevention. My career goal is to be an epidemiology professor with a robust combination HIV prevention research portfolio. As an epidemiologist with behavioral science exposure, I am well positioned to achieve this goal. However, to compete successfully for R01 funding, I would benefit from a brief period of mentored training and research. I have extensive experience in the design and analysis of behavioral research, but limited experience in the design and delivery of theory-driven behavioral interventions. In a two-year mentored phase, both my training and research activities will focus on cultivating skills for designing and delivering theory-driven behavioral intervention. I have assembled an exceptional team of mentors to support this goal: Dr. William C. Miller (primary mentor), Dr. Mina Hosseinipour (primary co- mentor), and Drs. Nuala McGrath, Carol Golin, and Suzanne Maman (co-mentors). All members of the team have prolific scientific accomplishments and extensive experience in the design, implementation and evaluation of combination HIV prevention approaches in sub-Saharan Africa. They are committed to supporting me and collaborating with each other. Mentored Phase Research (K99, years 1-2): In sub-Saharan Africa, strategies to increase HIV testing among men and engage them in HIV prevention, care, and treatment are urgently needed. Such engagement can have treatment benefits for HIV-infected men, prevention benefits for HIV-uninfected men, and treatment benefits for their HIV-infected female partners. Option B+, Malawi s program for providing immediate, lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to all HIV-infected pregnant women at the time of diagnosis, is a promising setting for engaging male partners in care. Within Option B+, I will develop an intervention that uses contract partner notification to recruit male partners and then engage them in a couple-based intervention with their HIV-infected female partner (Aim 1). The intervention will be guided by formative research and the dyad-level Interdependence Theory and aimed at improving linkage to care for HIV-infected male partners, preventing HIV acquisition for HIV-uninfected male partners, and promoting cART retention for HIV-infected female partners.     Independent Phase Research (R00, Years 3-5): I will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=500 couples) to assess intervention effectiveness at one year. I will assess whether the intervention increases HIV testing and linkage to care among HIV-infected male sex partners (Aim 2); identifies HIV-discordant couples, and decreases the likelihood of HIV exposure for HIV- uninfected male sex partners (Aim 3); and improves cART retention and viral suppression for all female partners (Aim 4). Future Directions: The R00 results will inform an R01 with longer-term viral suppression and HIV-incidence outcomes. I will transition from a mentored postdoctoral research associate to an independent investigator capable of designing behavioral interventions and leading combination HIV prevention trials."
"9469952","Project Abstract  Physical activity (PA) is broadly established as vital for preserving health and an effective method to manage and eliminate cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS) risk factors and symptoms. Hispanic or Latina (H/L) women have disproportionally lower PA rates and higher risk of CMS compared to white women. PA levels decline with the advent of motherhood, a time of greatest influence on offspring and future generations, making this time in the lifespan uniquely challenging. Active transportation (AT) is defined as using any type of human powered activity for any part of a commute to a destination, and improves levels of PA and related CMS risk factors. AT is enhanced by neighborhood walkability, improving CMS risk factors in white samples. AT could provide a culturally appropriate method to increase PA levels and improve CMS risk factors in H/L mothers, but to date, research on this topic among H/L mothers is absent from the literature.  The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between AT use in H/L women and the presence of CMS risk factors, whether a dose-response exists, and the association of neighborhood walkability with CMS risk factors and AT use. This proposed study will be a correlational study to investigate the relationship between AT use and neighborhood walkability on cardiometabolic risk factors among H/L women. This will be a sub-study capitalizing on an ongoing, NIH funded cooperative agreement: Partnering for PA in Early Childhood: Sustainability via Active Garden Education (SAGE; Sponsor Lee, PI; U01 MD010667-01). H/L mothers (N=100) of children participating in SAGE will be recruited from the ten early care and education centers (ECEC) in cohort 2 during baseline assessments. AT will be measured using the transport-related activity subscale from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and neighborhood walkability will be calculated through geocoding and Geographic Information Systems. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and waist circumference will be measured during SAGE baseline assessments. Fasting blood glucose, high density lipoproteins, and triglycerides will be measured using CardioChek Plus. Logistic and multiple regression will be used to test hypotheses.  The candidate's history as a registered nurse, combined with this proposed research and training will extend the candidate's knowledge and skills in PA and health disparities among H/L women. It will ensure the achievement of the short term goal of attaining the knowledge and skills of the scientific process to conduct ethical, high-impact research as a nurse leader, understand the physiologic mechanisms involved between PA and CMS, and provide evidence to inform an AT intervention to increase PA among H/L mothers. The long- term goal is to become an independent, externally-funded nurse researcher with a program of study aimed at developing culturally appropriate interventions to promote health equity among H/L populations. Results will help to inform efforts to prevent disease and disability and inform best practices for this vulnerable group."
"9498885","Kinase suppressor of RAS (KSR) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) scaffold that is subject to allosteric regulation through dimerization with RAF. Studies in model organisms suggest that direct targeting of KSR could have important therapeutic implications for cancer therapy; however, testing this hypothesis through pharmacological approaches has been difficult owing to a lack of small molecule antagonists of KSR function. We have recently identified a promising set of lead compounds that bind directly to KSR to antagonize oncogenic RAS-MAPK signaling (Dhawan et al., Nature, 2016). This unique class of small molecules, which operate through stabilization of the KSR inactive state (KSRi), antagonize RAS-MAPK signaling by impeding RAF-KSR heterodimerization and conformational changes required for activation of the RAS-effector kinase MEK. Furthermore, we have found that KSRi has the potential to increase the efficacy of currently available MAPK inhibitors (including MEK inhibitors) by increasing therapeutic index, thereby expanding the potential utility of currently available MAPK inhibitors to treat patients with RAS-mutant cancers. Our preliminary studies have been based on in vitro studies, including reconstitution assays, cell line studies, and crystallographic analysis. In this proposal, we build upon our early leads so to create novel chemical probes that would be suitable for in vivo experiments. Compounds that emerge from this work will be valuable tools for the investigation of RAS-MAPK mechanisms, targets, and therapeutics. Furthermore, we will investigate direct targeting of KSR as a mechanism to inhibit deregulated RAS-MAPK pathway signaling within patient-derived and drug resistant cancer models. The RAS-MAPK pathway is activated in approximately 25% of human cancers, most often through point mutations in K-RAS. Deregulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway in patients is believed to be a major determinant of cancer initiation, progression, metastases, and often resistance to targeted therapies. Certain subtypes of cancer show a high percentage of RAS mutations; it is estimated that 95% of pancreatic cancers, 35% of colorectal, and 25% of lung cancers are dependent on mutant RAS-MAPK signaling. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options for these large patient populations. Small molecule targeting of KSR offers a novel approach to modulate RAS signaling pathways in disease, which if successful, could impact a high number of cancer patients."
"9573163","The objective of this ShEEP proposal is to request Simoa SR-Plex Digital Immunoassay Platform (HD-1 Analyzer),which will offer researchers access to ultra-sensitive biomarker detection capabilities in a compact and affordable system. It is a digital immunoassay instrument capable of analyzing samples using the proprietary single-molecule array (Simoa) technology, and delivering ultra-sensitive measurements of proteins of interest over a wide dynamic range and with low coefficient variations (CV's). The Sioma Analyzer will aid in establishing ultra-sensitive immunoassays to serve VA-funded projects to study mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatments in various fields of study such as: inflammation, metabolism, neurology, oncology and cardiovascular disease. The projects cover an array of specialties as described below. Each Principal Investigator (PI) will benefit from Simoa Single Molecular Immunoassay Platform HD-1 Analyzer, which will establish an ultra-sensitive method for the detection and quantification of biomarkers previously difficult or impossible to measure. These applications are of great use for VA Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development Service (BLR&D) and Rehabilitation Research and Development (RR&D) funded investigators. Bingren Hu, M.D., Ph.D. will serve as the Project Director (PD)/ Principal Investigator (PI) for this proposal. Each investigator?s studies are vital to Veteran Health Care. Dr. Hu (PD/PI) will use the analyzer to test a novel hypothesis that brain ischemia- reperfusion leads to a cascade of events resulting in inactivation; as well as study novel mechanisms underlying brain ischemia-reperfusion injury and identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of brain IR injury. Tibor Kristian, Ph.D.?s study focuses on understanding injury mechanisms that lead to mitochondrial and ultimately cellular bioenergetic failure in stoke victims. Using this new system will establish the role of cell-type-specific disruption of mitochondrial dynamics of acute brain injury in animal brain ischemia models. Bogdan Stoica, M.D. will use this new system to investigate neuro-inflammatory processes in Traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is a major cause of death and long-term disability in both active-duty and Veterans military populations. Sergei Atamas, M.D., Ph.D. will use this system to investigate immunue- mediated tissue fibrosis. Tissue fibrosis is a major health issues in Veterans populations. Newly funded VA investigator France Carrier, Ph.D.?s research involves delineating the role of Dual Oxidase 2 (DUOX2) as a mediator of hyper-radiosensitvity in gastric cancer. An ultra-sensitive instrument such as the Simoa HD-1 will be particularly valuable to measure low levels of protein carbonylation in mice serum following radiotherapy. Tapas Makar, Ph.D. has a VA project that studies the effects of 7, 8-dihydroxyflavone DHF, which has potent brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) agonist activity that can be given orally and readily crosses the blood brain barrier as a potential treatment in a model of Multiple sclerosis (MS). This is currently being studied in a murine model of MS, and Dr. Makar will use the machine?s ultrasensitive assays for his award. Finally, Leonardo Tonelli, Ph.D.?s project studies the stress of deployment and exposure to traumatic events that puts soldiers at a greater risk than the general public for the development of psychological disorders- including anxiety and depression, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. He will use the analyzer to test preliminary results that strongly indicate that cluster of differentiation 8 positive (CD8+) cytotoxic T cells are a major source of systemic and brain inflammation, and promote susceptibility to develop maladaptive behavioral responses to stress."
"9454429","Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most lethal and aggressive form of breast cancer, and metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with IBC. To date, there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies that are specific for patients with IBC, and the molecular mechanism underlying IBC?s aggressiveness is not well understood. The long-term goal of the applicant?s group is to decrease the mortality associated with IBC by developing a novel therapy. The overall objectives of this application are to determine how the EGFR pathway promotes the progression of IBC and, through understanding the pathway, to identify novel therapeutic targets that could enhance the efficacy of EGFR targeted therapy. The central hypothesis is that the EGFR pathway is highly exploitable as a therapeutic target in IBC because this pathway promotes inflammation and cancer stem-like cell (CSC) self-renewal. The rationale for the proposed research is that identifying and validating novel targets will lead to the development of an efficacious combination-therapy approach to prolonging the survival of patients with IBC. On the basis of strong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine how the EGFR/COX-2 signaling axis regulates the CSC population in IBC cells; and 2) Determine predictive biomarkers of response to EGFR targeted therapy in patients with IBC. In the first aim, the effect of EGFR/COX-2 activation or inhibition on the IBC CSC population through the mediation of Nodal/TGF? signaling and the involved mechanism will be investigated. Further, potential combination approaches that could enhance the efficacy of EGFR targeted therapy will be identified. In the second aim, the role of EGFR/COX-2/TGF? axis molecules in predicting the response to PmAb will be determined, and the impact of PmAb on regulating the cross-talk between tumor cells and the adjacent microenvironment will be investigated. In addition, for patients receiving EGFR targeted therapy, RNA sequencing of before- and after-treatment samples will be performed to compare the differential gene expression profiles between patients who achieve pathological complete response and those who do not. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on the unique molecular features of IBC and uses a novel approach of targeting CSC in IBC through EGFR and/or inflammatory-related pathways; also, it utilizes a novel multiplexed immunostaining imaging technology that allows multiple sets of markers to be visualized within the same cells or tissue section. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to fundamentally advance the understanding of IBC and facilitate the development of a novel personalized therapy, leading to much more effective clinical trials for IBC and ultimately, reduced mortality from IBC. The regimen established from this work will also be adopted in a clinical trial for chemoresistant primary non-inflammatory breast cancers with triple-negative receptors, thus extending the clinical impact of this work for breast cancer patients."
"9496067","Infantile spasms is a severe childhood seizure disorder. The incidence is 1 in every 2000 -3000 live births. The spasms are only a few seconds in duration but occur in clusters of up to 100 in a few minutes. The EEG correlates of the disorder are unique. Coincident with each behavioral spasm is a brief ictal event and the interictal EEG is dominated by a chaotic pattern called hypsarrhythmia. The majority of children are intellectually disabled later in life and most of them develop other forms of drug resistant epilepsy. ACTH and vigabatrin can abolish spasms and hypsarrhythmia in 30-80% of patients - depending on the study. However, both drugs can have significant side effects and usually do not prevent the development of the intellectual disabilities and severe epilepsy seen later. Thus better treatments are needed and the hope is that with the advent of relevant animal models, the discovery of underlying mechanisms will lead to new therapies. Our laboratory has developed a model of infantile spasms that recreates the critical features of the disorder. Like infants, the majority of these animals respond to both ACTH and vigabatrin. However, our work has also pointed to a potential new therapy for this disorder. We have found that the expression of Insulin-like Growth Factor -1 (IGF-1) is suppressed in the neocortex of animals with spasms as is signaling through the PI3K-AKT- mTOR growth pathway. At the same time, the expression of parvalbumin and synaptotagmin 2, biomarkers for an important class of inhibitory interneurons and their presynaptic nerve terminals, are also reduced. This has led us to hypothesize that reduced signaling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway impairs inhibitory interneuron growth which results in an imbalance in synaptic excitation and inhibition and epileptic spasms. Remarkably, treatment with (1-3)IGF-1, a tripeptide derivative of IGF-1, rescues the inhibitory interneurons and abolishes spasms and hypsarrhythmia in over 60% of animals. Moreover, (1-3)IGF-1 dramatically augments the anticonvulsant effects of vigabatrin, reducing the dosage needed to abolish spasms and potentially eliminates its retinotoxicity. This synergy is likely produced by (1-3)IGF-1?s increase in the number of GABAergic nerve terminals and vigabatrin-induced increase in GABA levels in the same synapses. However, very little is known about (1-3)IGF-1 and experiments proposed here focus on understanding its mechanism of action. We plan to test 2 hypotheses. The first is that (1-3)IGF-1 acts through the IGF-1 receptor to activate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR growth pathway. The second is that (1-3)IGF-1 stimulates the growth of parvalbumin interneurons and thereby adds new GABAergic nerve terminals to the neocortex. Lastly, we will attempt to show that (1-3)IGF-1 acts via the IGF-1 receptor when it augments the anticonvulsant effects of vigabatrin. Our results will advance an understanding of the actions of a novel, naturally occurring neuropeptide that likely plays an important roles in neurodevelopment and neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, the combination therapy of (1-3)IGF-1 and vigabatrin has significant potential as a better way to treat infantile spasms."
"9566042","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant Environmental exposures are major causes of death and morbidity globally, and both outdoor and household air pollution are increasingly recognized as major contributors to years of life lost and disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Rapid urbanization In India has resulted in some of the world's worst air pollution, which contributes to the deaths of more than 620,000 Indians annually. Despite the known health effects of indoor and outdoor pollution, data are lacking on the dose-response relationship between exposures and specific causes of death and intermediate variables such as cardiometabolic factors in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India. Generation of data on the unique characteristics of environmental exposures in LMICs is urgently needed in order to mitigate the health effects. Not only is there a need to understand more about exposures in LMICs, but there is also a need to improve training of environmental health professionals who can translate this information into interventions to decrease exposure and improve health. The number of public health professionals in India is 1-2 orders of magnitude less than the estimated need, and the situation is particularly dire in the areas of environmental and occupational health. A sustained effort to increase the number of public health professionals with both deep training in environmental and occupational research methods and broad training in these areas as part of MPH or diploma degrees is urgently needed in India. In this proposed project, entitled Air Pollution and Health GeoHealth Hub Research and Capacity Building-US, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of researchers, mentors and program faculty from the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) to generate data needed to address the unique characteristics of exposures in India and to build the capacity of public health professionals in India to conduct high quality research and knowledge that can be translated into policy improvements. The training program will include a robust platform of short, medium, and long-range training components, including: Master's level training at HSPH, an intensive summer training and mentored research program, curriculum that will support the institution of an environmental health concentration in PHFI's existing Master's level training, and support for PHFI faculty involved in the U01 to complete mentored research activities at HSPH. The project will be led by Dr.Cash and Dr.Schwartz from HSPH and by Dr. Prabhakaran and Dr. Reddy from PHFI, who will be assisted by the: 1) Administrative Oversight Committee; 2) Training Oversight Committee; 3) Program coordination personnel at HSPH and PHFI; and 4) Supervisory teams to provide oversight for individual trainees. Evidence from the research conducted under the linked U01 will directly inform Indian government agencies and policy makers on how to reduce air pollution levels in order to reduce the consequent burden of disease. The proposed training of PHFI scientists will give build capacity to apply for future funding and fully understand and address this environmental threat."
"9443648","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell death and clearance are vital processes throughout development and in maintaining homeostasis. Apoptosis, autophagic cell death, and necroptosis are the most well characterized forms of programmed cell death; however, alternative cell death pathways are being discovered and characterized. During oogenesis in Drosophila, fifteen nurse cells support the oocyte through development. During late stages of oogenesis these fifteen nurse cell die and are cleared in a developmentally regulated form of cell death. This application aims to identify the mechanism of developmentally regulated cell death and clearance of nurse cells in late oogenesis. Preliminary data suggest a non-autonomous cell death induced by the surrounding stretch follicle cells. The first aim consists of characterizing the role of lysosomes in nurse cell death and clearance. Ex vivo live imaging and an RNAi screen of lysosomal processing genes will be utilized. The second aim is to determine how the stretch follicle cells surround the nurse cells. More specifically, I will use a genetic construct, Flybow, that expresses different fluorophores in a homogenous cell population; this will allow for tracking of individual stretch follicle cells through confocal microscopy. I will alo inhibit stretch follicle cell extension by pharmacological agents and dominant negative GTPases to test the requirements of stretch follicle cells surrounding nurse cells for their death and clearance. The third aim is to identify signaling molecules necessary for death and clearance of the nurse cells. This will be accomplished by identifying the secretome, the sum of all secreted molecules, of the stretch follicle cells by mass spectrometry. An RNAi screen of the secretome will be conducted in parallel. Altogether the goal of this application is to understand the mechanistic process of nurse cell death and clearance. The information gained from this work will be beneficial to better understanding non-apoptotic cell death in humans."
"9539798","Project Summary/Abstract The vestibular inner ear supplies information about head motion and position to the brain, driving powerful reflexes that stabilize gaze and posture during head motions, and contributing to our sense of heading and orientation as we move through the world. Although we are not normally aware of these functions, their loss severely affects mobility by destabilizes vision and causes vertigo. Loss of vestibular function often originates in damage to hair cells and their synapses with the afferent vestibular nerve fibers that project to the brain. These hair cells, synapses, and afferent fibers have striking properties that are only partly understood. The longterm goal of this program of research is to build a comprehensive understanding of how vestibular information is generated and encoded in the inner ear. The current proposal focuses on the synaptic transfer of head motion signals from hair cells to primary vestibular neurons (Aim 1) and the subsequent initiation of action potentials (spikes) (Aim 2) in the mouse utricle, a model preparation for genetic, developmental and physiological studies. Principal methods are whole-cell patch clamping of hair cells and afferent neurons; immunolocalization of voltage-gated ion channels, pumps and synaptic markers; and computational modeling of the hair cells, synapses and afferent nerve fibers, incorporating current information on ion channels, pumps, and morphology. Vestibular afferent neurons make conventional bouton synaptic terminals on type II hair cells and unique calyceal contacts on type I hair cells. At both boutons and calyces, hair cells release vesicles of glutamate (?quantal? synaptic transmission) into the synaptic cleft, activating glutamate receptor-channels in the postsynaptic membrane to produce excitatory postsynaptic potentials and initiate spikes. At calyceal contacts, an additional ?non-quantal? transmission mechanism depends not on vesicular release or gap junctions, but rather on flow of ions from the hair cell through ion channels into the synaptic cleft and into the calyx through different ion channels. Postsynaptic responses to controlled stimulation of individual hair bundles show that quantal and non-quantal transmission modes can occur at the same calyceal synapse and that the non-quantal mode provides a fast signal that may be important for high-speed vestibular reflexes. Proposed experiments and modeling will investigate the impact of key hair cell ion channels on non-quantal transmission and delineate how quantal and non-quantal transmission are integrated in individual calyces and afferent nerve fibers. Other experiments will test how specific voltage-gated potassium and sodium channels in calyces and boutons shape the postsynaptic voltage response and spikes in the axonal initial segment. Immunolocalization has revealed remarkable concentrations of ion channels in microdomains of the calyx ending and nearby spike initiation zone. Experiments focus on channels with the potential to shape salient differences in response dynamics and spike timing between afferents of different connectivity (hair cell inputs) and different zones of the sensory epithelium."
"9534369","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular Dystrophy surveillance, tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet) was established in 2002 to conduct population-based surveillance and long-term follow-up of individuals with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD). Longitudinal surveillance for DBMD has been ongoing since 2004. Active follow-up commenced in 2007 by administering telephone interviews to primary caregivers of DBMD cases to determine medical interventions and influence of family characteristics, geography, insurance status, and social support on clinical outcomes. Additional follow-up administered included mailed surveys to adult DBMD cases and their caregivers to examine needs and quality of life for these individuals and, most recently to describe transitions from pediatric to adult clinical care and other life experiences for late-adolescent and adult DBMD cases. In 2012, the MD STARnet was expanded to include cross-sectional surveillance for seven additional MDs (congenital, distal, Emery-Dreifuss, facioscapulohumeral, limb-girdle, myotonic, and oculopharyngeal). Our Iowa Site was one of four charter awardees for the MD STARnet in 2002 and was successfully refunded in 2006 and 2011. The Iowa Site has also served as the national MD STARnet Data Coordinating Center (DCC) since it was established in 2003. As the DCC, we successfully created and implemented an infrastructure that provided informatics expertise and support for all population-based DBMD longitudinal surveillance and research activities and for population-based cross-sectional surveillance for the additional MDs. We propose to continue as the DCC to provide expert informatics support for surveillance and research of MDs and selected neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop and maintain software applications, databases, and related documentation for surveillance data collection and analysis; 2) manage the pooling, cleaning, and dissemination of surveillance data collected by each project site; 3) distribute and provide support for application and databases required for surveillance data collection, clinical review, and data analysis; 4) provide technical assistance through participation in workgroups, committees, and in-person meetings; and 5) participate in the planning and implementation of the project evaluation plan. The Iowa Site has been successful with funding received to establish and operate the DCC, and we are enthusiastic about continuing such work. Continued use of our experienced DCC infrastructure will permit an efficient use of project resources for informatics expertise and support for surveillance and research activities for MDs and expansion of surveillance activities to selected NMDs."
"9442674","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is compelling evidence that accumulation of A? aggregates plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD); thus, multiple strategies targeting A? are being developed as therapeutics. Numerous preclinical studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting A? by active or passive immunization paradigms. Although anti-A? immunotherapies remain mainstays of disease modifying therapies being tested in humans, it is our general premise that current agents represent first generation therapeutics with suboptimal properties and that the therapeutic potential of immunotherapy can be dramatically improved by both enhancing the understanding of how immunotherapies work and by developing alternative biological immunotherapies. Indeed, there remain a number of unanswered questions regarding both mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of A? immunotherapies that are critical to address in order to optimize the approach. Herein, we propose three distinct, but interrelated, aims that will further explore aspects of A? immunotherapy. The experiments in Aim 1 represent a shift from previous studies in the area of AD immunotherapy. As opposed to using antigen specific antibodies targeting A? we will harness soluble Toll Like Receptors (sTLRs) as decoy innate immune pattern recognition receptors to therapeutically target amyloid and amyloid-like aggregates. The studies in Aim 2 stem from data showing that pro-inflammatory stimuli attenuate and anti-inflammatory stimuli promote A? deposition. We, therefore, propose that preexisting alterations in the innate immune activation state that are present in the aged human brain, but not as much in APP mice, might dramatically alter the efficacy of anti- A? immunotherapy. We will evaluate this hypothesis by exploring how pro- or anti-inflammatory preconditioning of the brain alters efficacy of anti- A? immunotherapy. In Aim 3 we will determine the cycling time of anti- A? antibodies between the brain and periphery and identify parameters that regulate this process. Establishing the cycling time is critical to understand the pharmacokinetics that regulate antibody exposure in the brain and has major conceptual ramifications regarding development of immunotherapies for A? and other CNS targets."
"9617038","Project Summary ?Exosome LRRK2 in Predicting Parkinson Disease Phenotypes? There is a critical need for quantitative biomarkers that predict Parkinson disease (PD) susceptibility and progression. Such biomarkers would aid the development of new therapies that slow or halt disease. PD has a clear genetic component that contributes to disease susceptibility. One gene in particular, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), harbors pathogenic missense mutations prevalent in some populations. LRRK2 is further linked to PD susceptibility through genome-wide association studies. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations upregulate LRRK2 kinase activity and increase levels of the autophosphorylated residue serine S1292 (pS1292). In our previous project ?Exploratory Laboratory and Analysis Projects in PDBP? (U18 NS082132), we focused our efforts on analyzing and measuring LRRK2 in clinical samples. We discovered that autophosphorylated LRRK2 (pS1292-LRRK2) could be detected and quantified in exosome fractions from both cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) and urine. We found elevated levels (~5 fold) of pS1292-LRRK2 in urinary exosomes from G2019S-LRRK2 mutation carriers with PD. In G2019S-LRRK2 mutation carriers, pS1292-LRRK2 levels successfully predicting clinical PD manifestation. We further analyzed pS1292-LRRK2 in a large cohort of cases and controls (n=160) from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Parkinson?s Disease Biomarker Program (UAB PDBP) and found that pS1292-LRRK2 levels predicted PD phenotypes in patients. Here we will determine the potential of exosome pS1292-LRRK2, purified from urine and CSF, in predicting PD susceptibility and progression in both early and mid-stage idiopathic PD cases as well as in LRRK2 mutation carriers. Project success will include the discovery of novel insights into the role of LRRK2 in the pathogenesis of PD and the development of a novel biomarker (exosome pS1292-LRRK2) that may predict PD manifestation in LRRK2 mutation carriers. The successful prediction of LRRK2 mutation carriers that will go on to develop PD would aid in future clinical trial design for LRRK2-directed therapies. Finally, we predict that the novel biomarker exosome pS1292- LRRK2 may help stratify idiopathic PD patients that will experience rapid progression of PD symptoms from those with more benign disease courses. Identification of PD cases with a poor prognosis would assist physicians in making treatment choices and clinical trial design for novel neuroprotective therapies."
"9493769","Project Summary Although flow cytometry has become a critical tool for analyzing immune cell populations in tissues, the technique is limited to approximately 18-20 parameters due to a number of technical issues. To address those limitations, an alternative technology has been developed. This technique ? Cytometry by Time Of Flight (CyTOF) employs heavy-metal labeled probes instead of traditional fluorescent-labeled probes. In this technique, cells are nebulized into a single-cell stream before being vaporized by an argon laser, and the resulting ion cloud analyzed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This is a relatively mature technology, whose application has resulted in fundamental new discoveries in the biological mechanisms underlying human immune responses in cancer, infectious diseases and basic immunology. Currently, this cutting-edge technology is not readily available to the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) research community. While an instrument is in place at Mount Sinai School of Medicine across town, it is both fully utilized and geographically challenging for CUMC to access this equipment. Based on a prospective survey of CUMC scientists, we have identified at least 6 NIH-funded major users as well as a large number of minor users. The proposed applications are diverse, leveraging the various scientific strengths of a number of CUMC labs. Some examples include Dr. Dalla-Favera?s work on understanding the phenotype of Large B Cell Lymphoma, Dr. Donna Farber?s ongoing studies of the tissue localization of human T cells, and Dr. Syke?s investigations into the basic cellular mechanisms of allograft rejection. The leadership of CUMC is strongly supportive of the acquisition of this instrument, and will provide significant additional funds beyond those requested in the S10 application. In addition, dedicated space has been allocated within the well-established CCTI Flow Cytometry Core where the instrument will be located and managed. Overall we hypothesize that the establishment of a CyTOF instrument on the CUMC campus will be pivotal in driving new scientific insights across a number of projects and disciplines."

Infants who have myelomeningocele (MM), a type of SB, often have bladder problems resulting from their SB. These problems, if not managed properly, can lead to serious kidney damage. A new protocol for bladder management for children with SB has been developed. This proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the bladder management protocol in newborn infants with myelomeningocele. The objectives of this project are: 1) To implement this protocol at for all newborns with MM receiving inpatient care at SCH, 2) To evaluate the effectiveness of the protocol in preventing bladder and kidney problems in the first five years of life. Newborn infants who are receiving inpatient care at SCH for myelomeningocele and have not been hospitalized before will be eligible to participate. Data will be collected for each participant at their follow up visits, using data recorded in the hospitl electronic and paper medical record. Information about the child's diagnosis, treatment, and health outcomes will be collected. Data analysis will be guided by the study coordinating committee, and will be to identify how well the protocol was implemented and how often children develop kidney and bladder problems."
"9513771","Aging is characterized by the development of systemic inflammatory changes, organ dysfunction and frailty. Aging is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation, which leads to impaired vascular repair, increased inflammation and increased monocyte adhesion. This is accompanied by the development of senescent (Sen) endothelial cells (EC), which originally were thought to be benign, but are now known to be a source of a sustained inflammatory output known as the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and other deleterious effects that contribute to the overall decline and frailty seen with aging. The vasculature has been under investigated as a contributor to the development of Alzheimer?s and other dementias, all of which are diseases predominantly associated with aging. We hypothesize that senescent (Sen) endothelial cells (ECs), which accumulate with aging, create a pro-inflammatory environment that adversely affects the blood brain barrier (BBB) and contributes to neuropathology implicated in age-associated dementias such as Alzheimer?s disease (AD). To this end we will use an established, well-characterized in vitro model of human Sen EC to study the effects of the SASP and exosomes derived from Sen EC, on human BBB integrity and neurons in culture. We will also analyze the content, including miRNA, of exosomes produced by Sen vs. early passage (EP) EC derived from the same donor, and determine whether co-culture with Sen ECs, SASP or exosomes increases the susceptibility of different neural cells to the toxicity of A?42 peptides. Lastly, we will investigate whether exogenous administration of exosomes derived from Sen EC compromises BBB integrity and promotes AD-relevant neuropathology in vivo in male and female TgF344-AD rats, which are an early onset Alzheimer's model. Age- and sex-matched congenic wild type rats will be used as controls. BBB integrity, neuroinflammation, neuronal connectivity, neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques will be studied using state of the art imaging modalities as well as biochemical and cellular analysis. This work has the potential to identify new mechanisms contributing to the development of dementias, such as Alzheimer?s, which is approaching epidemic proportions in our aging population. Such findings have the potential to lead to new therapeutic targets."
"9573837","Requested Equipment: The PerkinElmer Quantum GX microCT scanner is a high speed, three dimensional computed tomography (CT) scanner with a high voxel resolution of 4.5 microns. The scanner achieves images using low-dose ionizing radiation, making it ideal for longitudinal studies. The scanner can obtain images in a phase-locked manner to reduce the effects of respiratory or cardiac motion. The scanner is designed for in vitro and in vivo imaging and is able to accommodate animals up to the size of small cats. The requested microCT scanner will integrate with the PerkinElmer IVIS Lumina XR 2D spectral scanner that we already have available as a shared resource, allowing our researchers to acquire co-registered molecular optical signals with anatomical microCT data. Justification for the Equipment: The Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center (LSCVAMC) has approximately 200 active research projects. Several of these research projects require or could benefit from the requested microCT. The microCT affords several in vivo and ex vivo imaging opportunities. The data provided by a microCT is of interest to several of our researchers. Indeed, there are over 60 researchers in the Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and Advanced Platform Technology (APT) Centers who could expect to see improved outcomes in their research if they had more detailed knowledge of the nerves they were stimulating. Both of these Centers were designated ?Centers of Excellence.? Because of the broad application of the microCT scanner, there is a diverse range of researchers that can benefit from this equipment. The microCT scanner is intended to improve productivity and provide researchers at the LSCVAMC with a much-needed imaging system that is otherwise unavailable. Projection for Usage: There are several researchers at the LSCVAMC who would benefit from this system. We have identified 10 laboratories whom we believe will be the largest users during Year 1. Major users are supported by career development awards, merit reviews, research career scientist awards, and a small projects in rehabilitation research (SPiRE) award. Usage during Year 1 is expected to approach 40 hours per week with a goal to extend usage to 60 hours per week by the end of Year 2. VA-supported (major) users constitute nearly 80% of the usage time. Imaging targets include the nerve, muscle, bone, blood vessels, other tissues and organs, and airways. Imaging targets also include implanted devices. Benefit to Veterans: Collectively, there are several million Veterans with diminished quality of life due to obesity, sleep apnea, bladder/bowel incontinence and/or dysfunction, lost sensation, Alzheimer?s disease, osteoporosis, and mandibular defect. This microCT scanner will contribute to research in the area of neuroprosthetics that are being used to treat obesity, sleep apnea, bladder and bowel dysfunction, as well as the restoration of sensation in amputees. In a related area, the microCT will provide in vivo images of the body?s response to implants and allow investigators to develop new implants that produce less tissue insult. Regarding bone, the scanner will provide critical data to studies that are investigating the links between Alzheimer?s disease and osteoporosis as well as provide guidance on the optimal methods for surgical mandibular reconstruction and repair. Finally, the microCT will provide data on internal changes in tissues following application of regenerative therapeutics."
"9500513","Appetite is a basic drive that is essential to survival. The olfactory system can have potent effects on appetite in mammals, with certain odors stimulating appetite in humans, and either increasing or decreasing food intake and body weight in rodents. In the mouse, as in other mammals, olfactory sensory signals travel from olfactory sensory neurons in the nasal olfactory epithelium through the olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex and then to other brain areas. Odorants are detected in the nose by ~1000 different odorant receptors (ORs), each expressed by a different subset of sensory neurons. Neurons with the same OR are scattered in one nasal spatial zone, but their axons converge in a few specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, creating a semi- stereotyped sensory map in which each glomerulus and its associated mitral and tufted relay neurons, which project to the cortex, appears dedicated to one OR. Signals from each glomerulus travel to multiple distinct areas of the olfactory cortex. How the vast array of sensory information generated by this organization might impact appetite is unexplored. To begin to investigate this question, we conducted preliminary studies on olfactory inputs to two subsets of neurons linked to appetite, both of which are located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus: AGRP (agouti related peptide) neurons, which can enhance appetite, and POMC (pro- opiomelanocortin) neurons, which can suppress appetite. We found that only some odors affect the activity of AGRP or POMC neurons and that different odors activate AGRP versus POMC neurons. Using a Pseudorabies virus (PRV) that travels retrogradely across multiple synapses, we found evidence for neurons upstream of AGRP and POMC neurons in the olfactory cortex, but only in certain olfactory cortical areas. These observations are consistent with the idea that some olfactory sensory inputs can have innate effects on appetite and that those effects involve genetically programmed neural circuits that convey signals from specific ORs in the nose through the olfactory system to hypothalamic neurons that regulate appetite. In the studies proposed in this application, we will test the hypotheses that 1) AGRP and POMC neurons can receive input from selected ORs that are similar among individuals and recognize odorants that affect the activity of the appetite neurons and appetite behaviors, 2) neurons within specific areas of the olfactory cortex can influence AGRP or POMC neuron activity and appetite-associated behaviors, and 3) odor-responsive neurons in other brain areas can relay signals from the olfactory cortex to AGRP or POMC neurons to modulate their activity and regulate behaviors associated with appetite. Together, these studies should provide significant new insights into the molecular mechanisms and neural circuits that govern the impact of olfactory sensory signals on appetite."
"9427417","PROJECT SUMMARY RELEVANCE: About 1/3 of adults and 1/5 of children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese, with socially disadvantaged individuals being disproportionately affected. Rapid, excessive weight gain in early life often translates into persistent obesity, which may be in turn be associated with earlier onset of several health complications. Differences in obesity timing thus may be a vital way in which race-ethnic, socioeconomic and regional disparities in health widen over the life course. OBJECTIVES: Our study will measure the dynamics of weight status during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood and link these dynamics with subsequent health outcomes. A key contribution of our study is the careful and judicious use of statistical techniques to combine existing high-quality national longitudinal cohorts into a synthetic cohort of over 90,0000, followed from birth to age 55, reflective of recent experiences. AIMS: 1) Estimate the overall and sub-population dynamics of obesity, including the age and timing of obesity onset, age-specific incidence, obesity duration and intensity, weight fluctuations, and cumulative exposure to unhealthy weight. 2) Calculate the sub-population cumulative exposure to high BMI during childhood, adolescence and young adulthood for contemporary U.S. cohorts. 3) Estimate individual associations between exposure to high BMI across the first decades of life and adult health, specifically diabetes, cardiovascular, metabolic, and gastrointestinal diseases and quality of life, to quantify the health effects of early-life obesity dynamics. 4) Estimate the contribution of disparities in obesity dynamics early in life to disparities in other health outcomes across race-ethnic, SES, and urbanicity groups. 5) Develop a simulation to model the effects of interventions to reduce childhood obesity on national burdens of adult disease and disparities in disease. DESIGN: We will integrate 7 datasets into a single nationally- representative synthetic cohort. We will use recently-tested approaches to model multiple dimensions of weight dynamics. We will estimate the average number of years spent obese, as well as a continuous measure of BMI-years. We will link an individual?s obesity history with health complications using additive, duration, peak BMI, and weight change models. We will evaluate obesity dynamics separately in underserved race-ethnic, SES, and rural populations and will use decomposition approaches to quantify the contributions of these dynamic to disparities in health conditions. We will develop a ?macro-simulation? that allows us to assess the impact of reductions in obesity incidence at key points in childhood and adolescence on the national prevalence of obesity in adulthood, health complications in adulthood, and race, ethnic, socioeconomic and urbanicity disparities in obesity and other chronic conditions. SIGNIFICANCE: The creation of a synthetic national cohort addresses the critical absence of nationally representative data to track obesity from childhood into adulthood. Our research will provide the first comprehensive set of estimates of exposure to obesity during the first decades of life and their contribution to health and disparities in health over the lifespan."
"9657966","The filoviruses are NIAID/CDC Category A biodefense pathogens that cause severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever with 50-90% human lethality. There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or therapies for filovirus infection. Among the filoviruses, the Zaire Ebola virus species (EBOV) has been most extensively characterized. However, outbreaks of the Sudan Ebola virus species (SUDV) and Marburg virus (MARV) have been occurring with increased frequency and can be just as lethal as EBOV. Further, the pathogenic Bundibugyo Ebola virus species (BDBV) re-emerged in 2012 with increased lethality. Immunotherapy was recently demonstrated to provide post-exposure protection to EBOV challenge in nonhuman primates (NHPs). For MARV, convalescent sera from immunized NHPs can provide similar protection, suggesting that immunotherapy for all filoviruses will be tractable in humans. A robust pipeline of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting EBOV exists and will be developed in Project 1, but the pipeline for SUDV and MARV mAbs is less complete. Not a single SUDV or MARV mAb or mAb cocktail therapy has been evaluated in NHPs. Currently, there are no neutralizing BDBV mAbs. The goal of Project 2 is to fill these gaps in the filovirus therapeutic mAb portfolio. Among consortium investigators, a total of 216 murine mAbs against SUDV or MARV are available but have not been completely characterized; we will develop these mAbs and evaluate them for protection in rodent models and NHPs. In addition, we will identify new SUDV and MARV mAbs from human survivors of infection from outbreaks in Uganda, especially those in 2012. The consortium investigators have unprecedented access to four separate survivor cohorts of SUDV and MARV infection, and have demonstrated recently that neutralizing mAbs exist in peripheral blood of survivors. In addition, we will identify and characterize new anti-BDBV and broadly reactive anti-filovirus mAbs. Preliminary ELISA studies indicate that antibodies with cross-reactivity for the envelope glycoprotein (GP) from SUDV, BDBV and (in some cases) EBOV exist in peripheral blood of survivors who have been exposed to only a single filovirus species. We will use human hybridoma and antibody phage display technologies to screen the lymphocytes of survivors of filovirus infection for new BDBV and cross-neutralizing filovirus mAbs. The most promising candidates will be further evaluated in rodent and non-human primate challenge models. The end-point of this work will be a robust pipeline of mAbs for these understudied and re-emerging filoviruses."

"9616350","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the successes of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), important challenges remain that still limit their impact on human biology and medicine, especially for non-coding variants which remain poorly understood. In this proposal, we exploit recent advances (many pioneered by our group) to overcome these challenges and gain a systematic understanding of the role of non-coding variants in human disease and complex traits. First, we develop new statistical methods that utilize high-resolution regulatory annotations to predict disease-relevant tissues, chromatin states, and regulatory motifs, and to prioritize non-coding variants more likely to have regulatory effects within regions of genetic association using epigenomic state information, comparative genomic information, and regulatory motif analysis (Aim 1). Second, we develop a new Bayesian methods for linking regulatory regions to their upstream regulators and downstream target genes by integrating genetic information across all associated regions in the context of regulatory networks that link regulators and regulatory regions using their correlated activity, regulatory motifs, and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) information (Aim 2). Third, we validate our methods and predictions using massively-parallel enhancer assays to test the effect of large number of regulatory variants in isolation; using genome editing technologies to test the effects of regulatory variants in their endogenous context; and using cellular phenotypes and animal models to test the physiological effects of regulatory variants at the cellular and organismal levels (Aim 3), and use the results to refine our computational methods and models. Even though our experimental validations are only performed for a small number of traits and cell types that are amenable to such studies, our methods are general and will be applied to all genetic studies available through ongoing collaborations and public catalogs."
"9506010","Abstract Kidney dysfunction can precipitate serious medical conditions including proteinuria, osteoporosis, and formation of kidney stones. These conditions occur more frequently, and progress faster, in crewmembers stationed on the International Space Station. Current static models of the proximal and distal tubules are unable to recapitulate cellular functions including protein reabsorption via megalin, vitamin D metabolic bioactivation, and micro-crystal mediated injury response. We have developed a microphysiologic model of the proximal tubule using primary proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs) that has successfully demonstrated physiologic cellular structure/polarization, transport of glucose and drug substrates, bioactivation of inactive 25- hydroxy vitamin D to 1?,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (which promotes beneficial bone remodeling), and physiologic injury response to toxic exposure. We will expand this technology to develop a distal tubule epithelial cell model (DTEC) which will be used to explore the pathophysiologic response to oxalate microcrystals. Studying the proximal and distal tubules in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station presents the unique opportunity to observe accelerated disease processes (proteinuria, osteoporosis, kidney stones), which will facilitate the discovery of factors that contribute to the development and progression of kidney diseases that cannot be observed on a conventional time scale. Therefore, the aims of this project are: to determine the effects of microgravity on the polarized structural aspects (eg., ion and solute transporters) of the kidney proximal and distal tubule epithelium in a 3D microphysiological system, to determine if Vitamin D bioactivation/homeostasis within the kidney proximal tubule is compromised in response to extended exposure to microgravity, and to create a disease-state models of proximal tubule proteinuria and distal tubule kidney stone formation to evaluate the harmful or adaptive modulating effects of microgravity. A better understanding of the factors and pathways that underlie proper cellular structure and the development and progression of kidney diseases will uncover novel therapeutic targets that can be used in the development of pharmacologic agents that can improve the health of Space Station crewmembers as well as the health of the general public by preventing or reversing proteinuria, osteoporosis, and kidney stones."
"9470342","Project Summary/Abstract  Excessive alcohol use accounts for 88,000 deaths and nearly $225 billion in costs in the U.S. annually. Marriage is protective for alcohol use: married couples report less alcohol use than their unmarried counterparts. One pathway through which spouses influence each other is marital quality; marital quality is then inversely associated with alcohol use. Sexual minority people report elevated rates of alcohol use compared to heterosexuals, yet almost all past research on marital quality and alcohol use has been based on experiences of different-sex couples. We do not know if marriage is protective of alcohol use for same-sex couples as for heterosexual couples and whether these processes follow similar patterns when marriages consist of two men or two women. There is a need to understand marital quality and alcohol use in same-sex marriages to inform prevention and intervention programs to decrease sexual minority alcohol use disparities. In the proposed project, Ms. Pollitt's major objective is to assess how marital quality in same- and different-sex marriages relates to alcohol use and how these associations differ for men and women in these marriages. She proposes to address this objective through the following aims: (1) Compare the association of day-to-day marital quality with alcohol use in same- and different-sex marriages; (2) Identify non- marital stressors that exacerbate the estimated effect of marital quality on alcohol use in same- and different- sex marriages; (3) Examine the impact of marital quality and alcohol use on physical and mental health symptoms for same- and different-sex couples.  With the proposed research plan, Ms. Pollitt will address significant sexual minority population health concerns related to alcohol use and physical and mental health. To accomplish the goals of the research plan, Ms. Pollitt needs training in relationships and health, family demography, the etiology and epidemiology of alcohol use, and dyadic daily diary analysis. The training plan combines formal coursework with one-on- one mentoring with her sponsors and consultants to develop these substantive skills in addition to lengthening her publication record, enhancing her professional development, the completion of a federal grant application, and preparing her for an independent research career."
"9437760","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over 90% of breast cancer (BC)-related deaths are attributed not to the direct growth of the primary tumor, but rather to the spread of these malignant cells to distant organs, a process known as metastasis. Despite decades of investigation, a complete understanding of the molecular forces vital to metastasis remains incomplete, a gap in knowledge that has hindered the development of therapeutics that specifically target metastatic lesions. Contributing to this failure is the ability of disseminated tumor cells to enter a state of dormancy upon arrival to their metastatic microenvironment, wherein they remain viable and resistant to many standard-of-care chemotherapies, especially those that target rapidly dividing cells. Indeed, these cells do not persist indefinitely in a stat of dormancy, as they possess the capability to reinstate proliferative programs to provide the source for deadly metastatic recurrences years after clinical remission is initially achieved. The pathways underlying the initial instatement of dormancy and, more importantly, those crucial to subsequent escape from dormancy, are poorly understood and must be further interrogated in an effort to develop maintenance therapies that specifically target these undetectable cells. Since genetic changes are, by nature, less prone to arise and be selected for in a non-proliferative niche, it is natural to assume that dormant phenotypes are most susceptible to epigenetic alterations. We therefore seek to delineate epigenetic alterations critical to manipulating metastatic BC dormancy. In doing so, we will focus on a specific member of an emerging class of RNA, long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA), that has been shown to induce global changes in chromatin modification patterns and confer metastatic features to a dormant BC cell line. Using powerful epigenomic techniques in an established model of BC dormancy, we will map the epigenetic landscape modified by this lncRNA in concert with its molecular binding partners. These experiments will provide crucial insight into the mechanisms underlying BC dormancy both dependent and independent of this pro-metastatic lncRNA, thereby establishing the molecular foundation necessary to develop therapies that improve long-term outcomes for BC patients."
"9668976","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care."
"9503932","The goal of this study is to investigate the mechanism by which RIPK1 mediates the pathology of endothelial cells and its contribution to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a multifactorial and multifaceted disease with majority of demented patients display mixed AD and vascular pathology. While amyloid pathology has been recognized as a hallmark of AD, there is an increasing appreciation of the contribution from cerebrovascular pathology to AD. However, the mechanism that mediates the cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD is unclear. Most importantly, we have scarce knowledge regarding druggable targets that can be safely targeted to remedy the cerebrovascular defects for the treatment of AD. Recent studies have demonstrated that endothelial cells are able to undergo necroptosis, a form of programmed necrotic cell death that requires RIP1 Kinase (RIPK1) activity as well as RIP Kinase 3 (RIPK3) and MLKL. Furthermore, necroptosis has been implicated in mediating atherosclerosis and plaque rupture and can be targeted for both therapeutic and diagnostic interventions. RIPK1 is a key mediator of the innate immune response that regulates both inflammation and necroptosis. This study will provide important new insights into the mechanisms by which RIPK1 mediated inflammation and necroptosis contribute to the cerebrovascular pathology in AD as well as important biomarkers for the human clinical trials on RIPK1 inhibitor targeting AD.  The specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To investigate if pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 activity can rescue cerebral microvascular pathology and functional deficits in APP/PS1 mice as that of genetic inactivation of RIPK1 that we have shown. Specific Aim 2: To investigate the mechanism of RIPK1 in mediating cerebrovascular pathology in AD. This is to investigate the cell-non-autonomous role of RIPK1 mediated inflammation and cytokine release in microglia, and the cell-autonomous role of RIPK1 in regulating the gene transcription and the release of cyclophilin A (CypA) from endothelial cells in mediating cerebrovascular pathology of APP/PS1 mice. Specific Aim 3. To investigate if blocking necroptosis in brain endothelial cells can ameliorate cerebral vascular pathology in APP/PS1 mice. This is to knockdown the expression of RIPK3 and MLKL in cerebral vascular endothelial cells of APP/PS1 mice by shRNA using an endothelial specific AAV delivery system and examine their impact on the release of CypA and vascular pathology mediated by amyloid ?."
"9561622","Project Summary In pathogenic HIV and SIV infection innate and adaptive immune responses fail to control viral replication and, coupled with persisting immune activation, lead to the progressive depletion of CD4+/CCR5+ T cells and AIDS. Numerous HIV and SIV vaccines have also failed to elicit immune responses that can broadly prevent or control infection. Although immune control of HIV and SIV can occur, the determinants are unclear, as is the ability to induce these responses with vaccines. There is thus, an urgent need to identify and understand immune responses that can broadly prevent or control HIV/SIV infection and to elicit these responses with vaccines. A model is described in which deletion of a Gly and Tyr within a highly conserved trafficking motif in the SIVmac239 envelope (Env) cytoplasmic tail produces a virus (?GY) that in pigtail macaques (PTM) replicates acutely to wildtype levels, but becomes highly controlled by cellular immune responses in the absence of neutralizing antibodies. Remarkably, animals that control ?GY infection are able to prevent or control diverse challenges with homologous SIVmac239, heterologous SIVsmE660 and SHIV-SF162P3N, which are all highly pathogenic in PTM. Recent studies of mutations acquired in rare ?GY animals that progressed to AIDS and of viral evolution in PTM depleted of CD8 cells prior to ?GY infection, have implicated the loss of polarized trafficking of Env in infected cells as a driver for ?GY's altered pathogenesis. These findings have suggested that Env trafficking plays a critical dual role in promoting both cell-cell spread of virus in tissues and in evading CD8 cellular immune responses. As these events are mediated by virologic and immunologic synapses, respectively, we hypothesize that this motif is critical in vivo in promoting infectivity and modulating viral susceptibility to cellular immune attack. Findings with the ?GY model suggest that disrupting this motif can not only alter pathogenesis but also enable potent and broadly protective immune responses to occur. This testable hypothesis and its implications for vaccines will be assessed in 4 Aims: 1) To identify the immune correlates of ?GY control and responses that are shared during control of diverse challenges; 2) To provide a mechanistic understanding of this model by characterizing differences in virologic and immunologic synapses during ?GY and SIVmac239 infection; 3) To assess the impact of alterations in Env trafficking on immunogenicity in the context of a novel mRNA vaccine; and 4) To extend findings for the immunomodulatory role of this conserved trafficking motif in SIV to an HIV-1 Env. These highly novel observations are positioned to provide new insights into protective immunity for the SIV and HIV vaccine fields."
"9624938","Project Summary/Abstract Recent advances in genomic technology have led to quantitatively measuring the transcript abundance in a single cell, creating an unprecedented opportunity to investigate important biological questions that can only be answered at the single-cell level such as early cell development, cell identity and changes in cell state. This technology has already led to new biological discoveries by associating changes in the transcript profiles of individual cells with phenotypes including immune response, treatment and disease.  However, this technology also presents new statistical and computational challenges that need to be addressed to accurately interpret this data. While some methods developed for measuring transcript levels in bulk populations of cells can be used for single-cell data, such as aligning raw sequencing reads to the genome, other steps in the processing, such as normalization and quality control, require new methods to account for the additional sources of variability visible only at the single-cell level. Failure to account for the additional cell-to-cell variability leads to systematic errors and biased results in downstream analyses including differential expression detection, classification of cell types and quantification of transcriptional heterogeneity. The overall goals of the proposed research are to develop novel statistical methods that will 1) remove these systematic errors induced from this high-resolution technology by accounting for variability visible only at the single-cell level and 2) quantify biological variability such as transcriptional heterogeneity within and between populations of cells.  My long-term goal is to obtain the skills necessary for me to become a highly capable, independent scientist poised to bring significant statistical and methodological advances to the rapidly evolving field of genomics and transcriptomics at the single-cell level. Specifically, this award will provide the training, mentoring and career development to accomplish my research goals and transition to a tenure-track faculty at a research university with independent funding. At the completion of this award, I will become part of a new generation of researchers, proficient in statistics, computational biology and functional genomics, enabling me to work closely with biomedical researchers profiling the transcriptomes of individual cells."

"9437830","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Depression is a major public health problem for which the majority of patients are not effectively treated. This problem is exacerbated further in children and adolescents for whom only two antidepressant drugs are currently approved. Both belong to the selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of antidepressant, and act by blocking high-affinity uptake of 5-HT from extracellular fluid via the serotonin transporter (SERT). The therapeutic utility of SSRIs is thought to be triggered by downstream events that occur in response to their ability to increase extracellular levels of 5-HT. However, our studies using adult mice show that the ability of SSRIs to inhibit 5-HT uptake is greatly limited by the presence of non-SERT, decynium-22 (D22) sensitive transporters for 5-HT. Thus, by preventing extracellular 5-HT rising to therapeutically useful levels, non-SERT transporters provide a mechanistic basis for limited therapeutic efficacy of SSRIs. D22 inhibits activity of organic catio transporters (OCTs) and the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT). OCTs and PMAT are expressed in adult brain, but their impact on serotonergic neurotransmission may be even greater in juvenile and adolescent brain, particularly if their expression and activity is disproportionately greater than SERT. However, little is known about expression or function of SERT in juvenile and adolescent brain, and nothing is known about the expression and function of OCTs and PMAT at these young ages. Not surprisingly, nothing is known about the relation among SERT, OCTs and PMAT in juvenile, adolescent, and adult brain and antidepressant response. The goals of the proposed studies are to fill these critical gaps in knowledge by (1) providing a systematic profile for SERT expression and function in juvenile, adolescent, and adult mice and importantly, determining how expression and function of OCTs and PMAT varies with that of SERT, and (2) determining how the antidepressant-like response to blockers of these transporters differs among juvenile, adolescent, and adult mice. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that OCTs and/or PMAT play a more prominent role in 5-HT uptake during childhood and adolescence than in adulthood, and may be useful targets for antidepressant drugs, especially in this young population. Studies proposed here will afford new insight into mechanisms regulating 5- HT uptake in brain during childhood and adolescence, compared with adulthood. Given the strong link between dysfunction in 5-HT signaling and many psychiatric disorders, depression being prominent among them, elucidating mechanisms controlling 5-HT uptake in children and adolescents compared with adults will further our understanding of the etiological bases for these disorders and importantly, will guide the development of improved treatments."

"9658261","Abstract:  Project 3 addresses two approaches to inducing human immune tolerance to the pig, namely mixed xenogeneic chimerism and porcine thymic transplantation, in a humanized (HU) mouse model. We have demonstrated that each approach can centrally tolerize human T cells to the donor pig and we hypothesize that the combination of both approaches will ultimately be optimal. During the current funding period, we have obtained evidence that mixed xenogeneic chimerism leads to specific tolerance or global unresponsiveness of human NK cells. We have obtained evidence that mixed xenogeneic chimerism tolerizes human T cell- independent B cells producing anti-pig xenoantibodies. We have shown that human T cells developing in human and porcine thymus grafts are functional and dependent on human APCs in the periphery for homeostasis. Human T cells developing in porcine thymus grafts, while tolerant of the donor pig, have reduced homeostatic expansion and reduced responses to antigen presented by HLA. We hypothesize that such abnormalities may be corrected while optimal protective immunity and tolerance to the pig and the human will be achieved by injecting autologous thymic epithelial cells (TECs) into the porcine thymic graft and combining transplantation of this ?hybrid? thymus with mixed xenogeneic chimerism. We will: 1) Engineer a pig/human ?hybrid? thymus to mediate positive and negative selection of human T cells on both pig and human MHC molecules. We will evaluate the impact of a pig/human TEC-containing hybrid thymus and of mixed xenogeneic chimerism on tolerance, homeostasis and function of human T cells. These studies will be directly relevant to the baboon studies in Project 1 and are expected to achieve optimal tolerance and protective immunity; and 2) Determine the impact of duration of mixed xenogeneic chimerism on tolerance of human T, B and NK cells to the pig. We will determine the extent to which human CD47 expression on pig bone marrow prevents pig bone marrow rejection by human macrophages and enhances porcine chimerism in HU mice. We will then separately examine the impact of the duration of chimerism on the persistence of T cell, B cell and NK cell tolerance. We will examine the mechanism of persistent T cell tolerance if observed after loss of chimerism. We will also determine the impact of duration of mixed xenogeneic chimerism on human NK cell tolerance and of transgenic expression of HLA-E by pig bone marrow cells on induction of mixed chimerism in HU mice and on tolerance and function of human NK cells. Collectively, the studies will continue to guide the tolerance studies in Projects 1 and 2 and the development of optimal transgenic pigs in Project 4."

Dr. Joy Tsai is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Assistant in Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. She is well supported by the institution and will devote the majority of her time to clinical investigation. She will have full access to the rich resources of the Endocrine Unit, the Bone Density Center, Clinical Research Center, and Harvard Catalyst CTSC. She has chosen mentors with complementary expertise: Dr. Benjamin Leder is a leading clinical investigator in the field of bone and mineral metabolism. Dr. Mary Bouxsein is a leader in the field of biomechanics and cutting-edge imaging techniques. Both investigators have a strong record of mentorship with trainees progressing to academic independence. Both mentors are well-funded and are invested in this candidate's career development. The Scientific Advisory committee members (Dr. Henry Kronenberg, Dr. Joel Finkelstein, and Dr. Miriam Bredella) have expertise in skeletal physiology, clinical trials, and advanced musculoskeletal imaging and will provide scientific advice and career guidance during the transition to independent investigation. The research proposed in this grant aims to mechanistically define the effects of anabolic and antiresorptive therapy on bone quality. Current agents are unable to completely restore skeletal integrity in most patients with severe osteoporosis and are inadequate to match the anticipated rise in fracture incidence in our country's aging population. Thus, continued efforts to develop innovative evidence-based osteoporosis treatment strategies are crucial. This research plan proposes to utilize advanced high-resolution non-invasive imaging of bone and direct in vivo assessments of bone strength to assess changes in skeletal integrity. These techniques will allow for 1) the characterization of the changes in microarchitecture and estimated strength in women assigned a novel combination treatment strategy; 2) the characterization of the changes in bone material properties in women receiving the above combination therapy; and 3) the direct comparison of microarchitecture and estimated bone strength in women who have been previously exposed to bisphosphonates as compared with bisphosphonate-naïve women. In so doing, this proposal will help define the effects of diverse therapies on bone quality, an understanding of which is crucial in the design of rational therapies for osteoporosis. The candidate's research activities will be complemented by structured career development activities. She will be trained in skeletal physiology concepts, principles of conduct of clinical research, biostatistics, and ethics of human research through formal coursework, national conferences, workshops, and daily interactions with her mentors and colleagues. In summary, this proposed K23 award will allow the candidate to gain the experience and training necessary to achieve her goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator."

"9442735","PROJECT SUMMARY   Decades of research suggest nicotine is the primary psychoactive constituent of tobacco that results in  dependence. Consistent with this extensive literature and their regulatory authority to reduce (but not eliminate)  nicotine, the Food and Drug Administration has identified nicotine products standards that target the appeal and  addictiveness of cigarettes as a top research priority. Evidence to date suggests that smokers who are switched  to reduced nicotine cigarettes reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke, reduce their exposure to nicotine  and toxicants, and report less cigarette dependence. However, the implications of these observations are  complicated by the fact that few smokers actually quit smoking and most supplement their use of reduced  nicotine cigarettes with commercially available, non-study cigarettes that contain normal amounts of nicotine. If  normal nicotine content cigarettes were largely unavailable as a result of regulation, many smokers may turn to  alternative products, particularly e-cigarettes. The degree to which e-cigarettes facilitate further reductions in  smoking, or cessation, will likely depend on characteristics of e-cigarettes that impact their reinforcing effects  relative to conventional cigarettes. In particular, both nicotine concentration and availability of a variety of flavors  may affect the degree to which e-cigarettes substitute for cigarettes. Consequently, Project 2 examines how  three factors ? the nicotine content of cigarettes, the nicotine concentration of e-cigarettes, and the availability  of both tobacco and non-tobacco flavors of e-cigarettes interact to determine whether current smokers reduce  or stop smoking. Participants (N=480) at two sites will be randomized in a 2x2x2 design to receive A) cigarettes  with 0.4 mg/g vs. 15.8 mg/g nicotine; B) e-cigarettes in tobacco only vs. tobacco and non-tobacco flavors; and  C) e-cigarettes with 2 vs. 18 mg/ml nicotine. For 7 weeks, participants will be given a full supply of both cigarettes  and e-cigarettes. During the last week, participants will be given monetary incentives to abstain from smoking  tobacco. Equal numbers of younger (18-24) v. older (25+) and male v. female smokers will be recruited. We  hypothesize that reducing nicotine in cigarettes will reduce cigarettes smoked, cigarette dependence, and  exposure to toxicants while increasing use of e-cigarettes and the ability to abstain from smoking. We further  predict that these effects will be greater when participants are provided e-cigarettes with higher nicotine  concentration and both tobacco and non-tobacco flavors. We will also test the impact of condition on the  subjective effects of each product and explore whether the behavioral and subjective effects vary as a function  of age and gender. In summary, the proposed study will provide the Food and Drug Administration with critically  important information directly related to potential products standards for the nicotine content of combusted  tobacco. The results will determine how reducing nicotine in cigarettes impacts tobacco product use and effects  when e-cigarettes with different characteristics are available as alternatives.  0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 08/12) Page Continuation Format Page"
"9493631","PROJECT SUMMARY  A group of six NIH-funded investigators requests funding for the purchase of a Union Biometrica BioSorter, a large particle sorter, for installation in the Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core at Baylor College of Medicine. A primary application of the instrument will be the sorting and measuring of samples that cannot be handled by traditional flow cytometry based sorters. Samples of interest include the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, primary human organoids, and large and fragile cells such as adipocytes, skeletal myocytes, hepatocytes, or Schwann cells. The instrument will overcome sorting limitations by increasing viability of the samples as well as providing high-throughput for sorting, a tedious and time-consuming task currently done by hand under a microscope. In addition to the six major users, another group of seven minor users has expressed interest in using the BioSorter to sort cardiomyocytes, adult stem cells, and tumor spheroids.  The instrument will be located and managed by the Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core at Baylor College of Medicine. There is currently no such instrument in Houston, or even in the state of Texas. The major users are located at Baylor College of Medicine. Other users are both at Baylor College of Medicine and other institutes within the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas. In addition to greatly advancing the individual research programs of the users, the instrument will be available to all investigators at institutes within the Texas Medical Center and in the greater Houston area, fostering collaborative research and providing an important regional resource."
"9521256","Abstract To address the emergence and spread of multi?drug resistant tuberculosis, a novel semisynthetic series of spectinomycin analogs was generated with bacterial selective ribosomal inhibition and excellent narrow?spectrum antitubercular activity. These analogs, the spectinamides, lack cross? resistance with existing tuberculosis therapeutics, maintain activity against MDR? and XDR? tuberculosis, retain spectinomycin?s high selectivity index, and synergistically reduce lung bacterial burdens in chronic in vivo mouse models when used in combination with other TB therapies. The potent antitubercular and selective properties of spectinamides is the result of their ability to avoid intrinsic efflux by the Rv1258c pump, demonstrating that synthetic modifications to classical antibiotics can overcome the challenge of intrinsic efflux pump?mediated resistance. Detailed SAR has been developed for protein synthesis inhibition and efflux avoidance, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo efficacy of the spectinamides. The most notable result is the synergy observed when spectinamides are combined with rifampin and pyrazinamide in C3HeB/FeJ mice bearing tubercular lesions with similar pathology to those found in humans. In this renewal, we aim focus the development of the spectinamides as combination agents capable of working synergistically with other TB agents to clear infections in necrotic lesions through 3 iterative aims: (i) Combination studies. The goal of this aim is to evaluate and define spectinamide combination treatments that specifically target synergistic activity in the necrotic granuloma. (ii) Generation of second generation antitubercular spectinomycin analogs. The design and synthesis of the next generation of spectinomycin antitubercular antibiotics with the primary goal of increasing the therapeutic window of lead compounds via improved host tolerability, bioavailability, distribution into the granuloma, and efflux avoidance. (iii) Evaluation of second generation spectinamides ? Compounds synthesized in aim 2 will progress through three iterative stages of tests that include microbial assessment, pharmacokinetic testing, toxicologic and in vivo efficacy experiments."
"9451931","Project Abstract Hypothalamic hormones regulate multiple physiologies, and changes in their signaling to a variety of pathologies including obesity, growth and metabolic abnormalities, and sexual dysfunction. Prominent neuroendocrine pathways that regulate physiologies of metabolism, growth, and stress, all rely on hypothalamic input for their control. Little is known about extra-hypothalamic inputs that control these pathways. Towards this goal, we have discovered a novel projection from the basal forebrain cholinergic system to the hypothalamus and median eminence. Furthermore, we have shown that an increase in the activity of these cholinergic neurons leads to a novel hormone-driven weight loss phenotype. Using innovative techniques in conditional viral genetics, cell-type specific neuronal manipulations, cell-type specific labeling, optogenetics, and ultrastructural imaging we propose to determine the role of basal forebrain cholinergic signaling on hypothalamic hormone release. Specifically, we propose to (1) determine which hypothalamic- pituitary axis hormones are altered by changes in cholinergic tone and (2) determine how cholinergic signaling alters the release of hypothalamic hormones."
"9668008","ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our research is to determine if exposure to contaminants from the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster of September 11, 2001 caused neuropathic symptoms, and nervous system injuries in the WTC ?Survivor? population. Our preliminary findings demonstrate a high prevalence of neurologic symptoms among both Survivors from the general community and first responders. There are numerous causes of neuropathic symptoms, however, such as diabetes, anemia, anxiety, and exposure to non-WTC-related neurotoxins. Neuropathic symptoms thus need to be investigated to understand whether they are due to WTC exposures. The first objective of this project is to explore the connection between WTC exposure and neuropathic symptoms through use of existing longitudinal data and neurological studies. Our second objective is to refine our understanding of neurologic symptoms with more complete questionnaires, neurological examination and objective testing (electromyography/nerve conduction velocity [EMG/NCV]; histopathologic evaluations; and blood tests for HgbA1c, B12, exposure to neurotoxic infectious agents, and neuron-specific enolase) in the context of a case-control study of patients with and without neuropathic symptoms. Our specific aims are (1) to analyze longitudinal data to describe the evolution of paresthesias in the survivor population; and (2) to analyze EMG/NCV data in order to investigate the pathophysiology of the reported paresthesias; and (3) to examine whether neuropathic symptoms among Survivors and Responders are associated with abnormalities in nerve fiber densities or EMG/nerve conduction studies. Already- performed EMG/NCV studies neurologic studies (n=80) will be analyzed to determine their relationship to neuropathic symptoms and to explore correlates of persistence, deterioration or improvement over time in these symptoms. We will evaluate nerve fiber densities as risk factors for neuropathic symptoms as part of the case-control study. Cases will be 40 patients with persistent neuropathic symptoms on at least 2 study visits drawn from patients enrolled in the Bellevue WTC Environmental Health Center (WTC EHC). Controls (n=40) will be drawn from the same WTC EHC population; individually matched to cases on age, race, gender and absence of histories of diabetes, cancer and paresthesias or neurologic disorders prior to 9/11/2001; but free of paresthesias on all study visits. A community-based, non-WTC-exposed control group (n=20) also will be enrolled, frequency-matched to cases on the same matching variables as the WTC EHC controls, in order to determine the prevalence of abnormalities in the general population without WTC-exposure. Case-control study participants found to have neuropathic symptoms will be referred for optional EMG/NCV studies to elucidate mechanisms underlying neuropathic symptoms. Successful completion of this project will clarify whether exposure to WTC toxins caused the observed neuropathic symptoms."
"9530248","Project Summary/Abstract Human polyomaviruses have been implicated in disease arising in multiple organs. In skin, polyomaviruses have been linked to both cancer (Merkel cell carcinoma) and a hair follicle disorder (trichodysplasia spinulosa) which is seen almost uniformly in immunosuppressed patients, and is strongly linked to trichodysplasia-associated polyomavirus (TSPyV). The clinical findings in trichodysplasia spinulosa include numerous minute follicular papules, most commonly on the face, with prominent hyperkeratotic spicules in place of hair shafts. The affected follicles are distended and comprised almost exclusively of hair matrix cells, inner root sheath-like cells, and masses of abnormally keratinizing cells, with a poorly formed or inapparent dermal papilla. Essentially nothing is known about how TSPyV infection leads to these profound alterations in hair follicle biology. In this exploratory proposal, we will use mouse models to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying development of trichodysplasia spinulosa. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that one or more TSPyV transforming antigens (TAgs) drive aberrant proliferation of hair matrix cells, leading to disproportionate expansion of inner root sheath cells at the expense of cell lineages comprising the hair shaft. We propose to generate Cre-inducible mouse models to express TSPyV TAgs in a spatially and temporally restricted manner in adult mice. We will characterize resultant changes in proliferation, cell death, and lineage marker expression; and screen for alterations in candidate signaling pathways. The proposed studies will yield novel insight into the molecular and cellular basis of trichodysplasia spinulosa and may identify new targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9668357","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spina Bifida clinic standards are not well described or standardized. While multi-disciplinary clinics are considered the standard of care for children with Spina Bifida, evidence to support this model in adults is lacking. Good, seamless health care delivery is important for people with Spina Bifida; however, current systems of care designed to meet the needs of children with Spina Bifida end when a child becomes an adult. Finding good care for adults with Spina Bifida is difficult because of the number of specialists needed, the limited number of practitioners serving this growing population, systems of care that is unprepared to deal with their needs, their growing chronic adult needs, and the lack of knowledge about them. This group is facing a precarious future unless a collaborative approach is initiated to identify their needs and create a health care system that offers uniform, adequate multi-disciplinary care. The creation of the Clinical Care Monitoring and Tracking (CCMT) infrastructure is about looking for problems and needs and about assessing and harnessing the strengths and resources that promote better health and well-being in the Spina Bifida community. Research efforts into the Spina Bifida clinic network resulted in a National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NSBPR), the compilation of the clinics list, a clinic classification schem, and the creation of the World Congress on Spina Bifida Care and Research. The Spina Bifida Association (SBA) is currently leading the Spina Bifida Collaborative Care Network (SBCCN) in developing a strategic plan to close the health care gaps that have been outlined. The goals of the SBCCN are to identify the needs of people living with Spina Bifida, develop and implement approaches to connect and communicate with adults living with Spina Bifida, address health care needs as well as gaps in care, improve the availability of information on health and community resources, identify and promote research priorities for the NSBPR, develop a quality-based Spina Bifida clinical structure using the (2008) classification scheme, describe and disseminate the list of Spina Bifida care sites that meet the quality-based clinical structure, and develop, implement, and disseminate a comprehensive evaluation plan that measures the effectiveness of the activities of this funding announcement. Expected Outcomes are creation of a public health infrastructure that monitors, tracks, and evaluates Spina Bifida care across the lifespan, development of health outcomes for people with Spina Bifida, and the improvement of a high performing Spina Bifida clinic structure."
"9445430","Kaposi?s  sarcoma-­associated  herpesvirus  (KSHV)  is  the  etiologic  agent  of  several  cancers.  Despite  highly  active  anti-­retroviral  therapy,  Kaposi?s  sarcoma  (KS)  remains  as  a  dominant  cancer  in  AIDS  patients.  The  hallmark  pathological  features  of  KS  are  excessive  deregulation  of  angiogenesis  and  extreme  invasiveness  manifested as multifocal tumors and involvement of visceral organs. Thus, understanding the molecular basis  of  KSHV-­induced  angiogenesis  and  cell  invasion  could  serve  as  the  basis  for  developing  novel  therapeutic  approaches. Our US-­China collaborative team funded by previous cycle of the US-­China Program has made  significant  progresses  toward  this  goal  by  1)  developing  a  novel  model  of  KSHV  infection  of  human  primary  mesenchymal  stem  cells  (MSCs),  in  which  KSHV  induces  angiogenesis,  cell  invasion,  malignant  transformation and tumorigenesis closely mimicking human KS tumors;? 2) demonstrating the essential roles of  KSHV microRNAs (miRNAs) in KSHV-­induced angiogenesis and cell invasion;? 3) identifying KSHV miR-­K6-­3p  as  a  pro-­angiogenic  miRNA  that  induces  angiogenesis  by  targeting  SH3  domain-­binding  glutamic  acid-­rich  protein (SH3BGR) to activate the STAT3 pathway;? and 4) demonstrating that KSHV miR-­K3-­5p promotes cell  invasion by targeting G-­protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) to activate the AKT signaling. We propose to  extend  these  exciting  discoveries  with  the  objective  to  further  dissect  the  molecular  mechanisms  by  which  KSHV  miRNAs  promote  tumorigenesis  by  inducing  angiogenesis  and  cell  invasion,  and  to  explore  the  therapeutic application of these discoveries. The central hypothesis is that KSHV encodes specific miRNAs  to  activate  angiogenic  and  invasive  pathways  contributing  to  KSHV-­induced  tumorigenesis,  and  as  a  result,  targeting  these  pathways  can  effectively  inhibit  the  development  of  KSHV-­induced  cancers.  We  will  identify  KSHV  miRNAs  that  mediate  KSHV-­induced  angiogenesis  and  define  the  mechanisms  of  action  (Aim  1);?  identify KSHV miRNAs that mediate KSHV-­induced cell invasion and define the mechanisms of action (Aim 2);?  delineate  the  roles  of  pro-­angiogenic  and  pro-­invasive  miRNAs  in  the  development  of  tumors,  and  in  tumor  angiogenesis  and  invasion  (Aim  3);?  and  explore  the  therapeutic  application  of  targeting  angiogenic  and  invasive  pathways  activated  by  KSHV  miRNAs  in  KSHV-­induced  tumorigenesis  (Aim  4).  This  application  will  further reinforce the collaborative efforts of the two US and China teams with highly complementary expertise  to accelerate the advancements of the proposed project that are otherwise difficult to achieve by the individual  laboratories. The results from this project will be highly significant and innovative because they will, for the  first time, define the functions and mechanisms of action of KSHV miRNAs in tumor angiogenesis and invasion  in a genuine KS model, and identify novel targets for developing innovative therapeutic approaches. The study  will also establish a novel paradigm of oncogenesis mediated by viral subversion of the miRNA pathway, thus  providing insights into the oncogenesis of other cancers.      "
"9416610","Project Summary/Abstract: Target Validation Core (Core 3) With the explosion of new technologies, biomedical research has been moving at a very fast pace in generating novel links and suggesting promising therapeutic avenues. The research proposed in the MTDD COBRE application is expected to identify a number of exciting molecular targets. However, before further efforts and resources are devoted to these targets, it is crucial to have validation for physiological relevance and functional significance. With the common goal of achieving target validation, we propose to establish two key resources at UNMC, the Genome Editing facility and the Mouse Model and Imaging facility. Together, these facilities will comprise the Nebraska Center for Molecular Target Discovery and Development Target Validation Core. The newly developed genomic editing technology, CRISPR, allows researchers to examine the relevance of their target proteins or processes in a clean genetic background within a significantly shorter time frame. As we have accumulated extensive experience in the CRISPR technology, we propose to establish a core facility to provide the MTDD researchers with knockout or knockin cell lines for their genes of interest, thus allowing them to validate their findings in a reliable and efficient fashion. Another essential component of target validation is to determine the effect(s) of novel genetic, pharmacological, and environmental interventions on patient outcome. Mouse orthotopic xenograft models are ideal systems for the initial assessment of the impact of clinical interventions on disease outcome. To support the studies proposed in the MTDD COBRE application, we propose a core facility, which will focus on mouse models and feature state-of-art, advanced imaging capabilities to detect and monitor tumor development and progression non-invasively and effectively. Investigators with access to this core service will thus be better poised to understand the functional impact of specific genetic and pharmacologic interventions. Additional core strengths will include mouse metabolic assessment (by indirect calorimetry). The Core co-leaders have many years of experience in the field. Core staff are highly trained. We propose to ensure rigorous core quality at both an experimental (operator training and formalized equipment maintenance) and a systematic (input resulting from an annual external advisory board meeting) level. Together, the Target Validation Core is expected to provide the necessary technical input in target validation, and support MTDD investigators in achieving their goal of conducting high-impact research."
"9435547","PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), characterized by the deposition of amyloid-? protein (A?) in the basement membrane of small arteries and capillaries of the leptomeninges and cerebral cortex, occurs sporadically or as a result of genetic mutations. CAA plays an important role in the multimorbidity of aging brains. In the early stages, CAA triggers cerebrovascular inflammation and causes microhemorrhages, vascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment; in advanced stages, CAA often leads to massive lobar hemorrhages. The incidence of sporadic CAA increases with age and it is a common pathological feature of brains with Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Currently there are no approved therapies to treat CAA. Blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and impaired vascular health cause diminished A? clearance at the BBB and trigger CAA/AD. Strategies that remodel cellular trafficking at the BBB and improve vascular function are expected to enhance brain A? clearance, mitigate CAA/AD, and improve cognitive function. High levels of circulating high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its main protein component, apoA-I, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Compelling evidence indicates that HDL/apoA-I also modulates neurobiological functions. High levels of HDL/apoA-I are associated with superior cognitive function in the elderly, whereas low levels of HDL/apoA-I increase the risk for AD and intracerebral hemorrhage. In animal models, manipulation of HDL biogenesis pathways modifies the development of AD-like pathology and behavior. In particular, we have shown that overexpression of human apoA-I rescues cognitive function in AD mice by attenuating CAA and neuroinflammation. Consistently, others have shown that deletion of apoA-I increases CAA and exacerbates cognitive deficits in AD mice. In preliminary studies, we found that a unique HDL/apoA-I mimetic peptide known as 4F, which has advanced into clinical trials for cardiovascular disease, augments HDL function of AD mice, effectively inhibits A? aggregation, protects cultured neurons against A?-induced cytotoxicity, efficiently penetrates the BBB, and promotes the efflux of A? across the BBB. Thus, we propose to repurpose the peptide for CAA/AD and hypothesize that treatment with the HDL mimetic peptide facilitates the clearance of cerebrovascular A?, mitigates CAA and other AD-related pathologies, and improves cerebrovascular and cognitive functions. Three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis by using a combination of innovative in vivo and in vitro approaches. Aim 1 is to determine the mechanisms by which the HDL mimetic peptide modulates cerebrovascular A? clearance. Aim 2 is to evaluate the impact of the HDL mimetic peptide on cerebrovascular function using non-invasive imaging/tonometric technologies in both wild type and CAA/AD mice. Aim 3 is to assess the efficacy of the HDL mimetic peptide to mitigate CAA- associated cognitive deficits and neuropathologies in CAA/AD mouse models. Results from these proposed studies are expected to provide a novel approach to combat CAA/AD."

"9443682","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) results in a three-fold increase in progression to end stage liver disease and cirrhosis compared to HCV alone. Although curative treatments exist, less than one quarter of people with HCV are linked to care and even fewer have received treatment. The proposed study is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial to improve the HCV treatment cascade among people coinfected with HIV. This study will test whether a nurse case management intervention can 1) improve linkage to HCV care and 2) decrease time to HCV treatment initiation among people coinfected with HIV. Participants will be recruited from an urban HIV clinic that serves a primarily low income African American population with 50% of patients coinfected with HIV/HCV. Barriers to HCV linkage and treatment among people with HIV include low knowledge, competing demands, and HIV/HCV drug interactions, which can be addressed with nurse case management. The nurse case management intervention will be conducted in two phases. The first phase includes nurse-initiated referral, strengths-based HCV education, patient navigation, and appointment reminders. The second phase includes care coordination of antiretroviral modifications to minimize the impact of HIV/HCV drug interactions. The intervention components are guided by the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, which will be used to explain why participants engage or do not engage in HCV care. The findings from this study will ensure that the most effective linkage to care and treatment approach is integrated into care of this population. This study supports the President's Care Continuum and Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis, as well as the latest Guidelines for Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-infected Adults and Adolescents. This study's purpose is directly aligned with the NINR's strategic plan to improve health in minority and underserved populations through evidence-based interventions that promote wellness and self-management."
"9451219","Abstract of the Research Plan Despite significant research effort to understand the aging process, we are still not able to confidently answer fundamental questions: Why do we age and can we delay it in humans? Recent studies suggest that various age-related pathophysiological conditions may have common underpinnings, the so-called hallmarks of aging that include mitochondrial defects, cellular senescence and inflammation. Our research group has worked for more than a decade on NAD+-dependent lysine deacetylases known as the Sirtuins (SIRT1-7). Thanks to this grant, we discovered a new cause of aging that explains why mitochondrial function declines with age, a process we call ?Genome Asynchrony?. Genome asynchrony manifests in heart and muscle tissue (and possibly other tissues) as a breakdown in nuclear-mitochondrial communication due to a decline the NAD+ levels and loss of SIRT1 activity. The result is the stabilization of the hypoxia factor HIF-1? in the absence of hypoxia (a phenomenon we call ?pseudohypoxia?) and a potent inhibitory effect on nuclear- mitochondrial communication. Importantly, by feeding old mice the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), for one week, thus restoring NAD+ to youthful levels, the mitochondrial defects of old muscle can be rapidly reversed, demonstrating that NAD+ is a key regulator of aspects of aging in mice and that aspects of aging are reversible. During the study we discovered that the NMN treatment was able to rapidly reverse key markers of aging in the muscle, suggesting declining NAD+ levels may underlie inflammation during aging. We find that NAD+ levels and HIF-1? specifically control the secretion of IL-18 and IL-1? by regulating the activity of the inflammasome, a key regulator of healthspan in mammals. In the next phase of the grant, we will determine the NAD+-dependent mechanisms that regulate inflammation along with its role in the secretory phenotype of senescent cells (SASP) and test interventions to counteract these pathways. Aim 1 is to use primary macrophages from genetically modified mice (GEMMs), along with novel epigenetic manipulation technologies and clinic-ready small molecules to test our hypotheses. In Aim 2, we will perform a comprehensive study of this pathway in vivo using young and old mice from colonies of both wildtype and GEMMs with altered levels of NAD+ and HIF-1? throughout the body or in specific tissues such as muscle and brain. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the efficacy of the best NAD+ modulating compounds (from Aim 1) to prolong healthspan and lifespan in mice. We will also test the best compounds for their efficacy in a gold- standard model of acute gout (a common age-associated inflammatory disease for which there are no effective treatments) thereby paving the way for rapid human clinical trials. The work will have far-reaching implications by changing our understanding of why aging occurs and creating novel therapeutics to prolong human healthspan and longevity."
"9435066","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have identified a functional role for Myc-related transcription factors of C. elegans in the process of aging. This family consists of two different heterodimers, the MDL and MML complexes, respectively, which have opposing roles in transcription and longevity control. The MML complex can extend lifespan and activate target gene transcription, whereas the MDL complex shortens lifespan and represses gene activity. These complexes interact genetically and molecularly with both insulin/IGF signaling and with dietary restriction. Thus, the Myc family of transcription factors represents a newly discovered convergence point for these central aging related pathways. We will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the MML and MDL complexes influence longevity. Orthologous mammalian transcription factors have been linked to nutrient sensing, metabolic control, and disease. We will use metabolomics to discover the specific metabolic pathways that are altered by the MDL/MML complexes and link those metabolic changes to longevity using genetic and functional genomic approaches. The MML and MDL transcriptional complexes represent an evolutionarily conserved entity for coupling nutrient sensing, metabolism, and aging. Characterizing the newly discovered role of Myc transcription factors in the dynamic interplay between distinct longevity signals, in the experiments proposed here, may facilitate the development of rationale strategies for the treatment of age-associated disease and metabolic disorders (e.g. diabetes, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance) to promote human health."
"9468220","PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BPD) is an affective disorder causing life-long cycling between mania and depression, afflicting 1-2% of the population and resulting in suicide in 15% of patients. The etiology of BPD is unknown, and first-line treatments such as lithium have no known mechanism of action. Our lab has shown that lithium directly inhibits GSK-3, that lithium activates Wnt/?-catenin?a signaling pathway inhibited by Gsk3?in the brain, and that GSK-3 inhibition mediates the behavioral effects of lithium in mice. This proposal combines behavioral analysis with cutting-edge brain imaging techniques and modern mouse genetics to define with cellular resolution the cells that are directly targeted by lithium in the brain, track cell fate decisions following lithium-induced neurogenesis, and test the requirement for Gsk3, using conditional genetic deletion, in mediating the behavioral and neurogenic effects of lithium. The first specific aim takes an unbiased approach to identify which neurons and other cell types in the brain directly respond to lithium using a novel fluorescent reporter for Wnt/?-catenin activity as a surrogate for GSK-3 inhibition. We will further identify the cell fate decisions of adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) undergoing lithium-induced neurogenesis to determine whether the pro-neurogenic effect of lithium is likely to play a direct role in its therapeutic mechanism of action. The second specific aim asks whether Gsk3 loss specifically in postnatal forebrain neurons is required to mimic lithium's effects on behavior, which was not tested in previous studies of GSK-3 inhibition on behavior. Furthermore, we will determine whether deletion of Gsk3 in specifically adult NSCs phenocopies lithium's effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and NSC fate decisions. The research strategy described in this proposal will provide the applicant, Dr. Melinda Snitow, comprehensive training in the field of neurogenesis, mouse neurobehavioral testing, and state-of-the-art imaging techniques, which are critical to develop a career studying the etiology and treatment of BPD.

"9527630","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improper food handling practices in the food service setting are important risk factors for foodborne illness. New Yorkers eat out nearly one billion times each year, and two-thirds eat meals from a restaurant, deli, coffee shop or bar at least once per week, so the potential public health impact of unsafe food handling practices in New York City (NYC) restaurants is enormous.  NYC is home to over 24,000 restaurants and 5000 mobile vendors. The NYC Department of Health & Mental Hygiene is responsible for permitting and inspecting these entities for compliance with food safety and hygiene rules. With support from CDC EHS-Net, we will develop and evaluate a series of food safety interventions to be distributed to the NYC food service industry. We will use data collected during routine inspections to inform content of interventions and assist in targeting the poorest performing restaurants. We will integrate a systematic collection of environmental assessment data into our foodborne outbreak investigation protocol to better understand the environmental factors associated with foodborne illness. These data will be reported to the National Voluntary Environmental Assessment Information System to support national surveillance initiatives. We will also participate in multisite food safety studies proposed by CDC EHS-Net.  We will promote food safety in NYC restaurants and mobile food vending settings using three types of interventions: 1) restaurant operator and food worker education, 2) enhanced training of Health Department inspectors who educate operators during inspections, and 3) regulations and policies. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the food safety promotion tools in use in NYC to inform restaurant and mobile vending food safety programs both in NYC and nationally."
"9517297","Project Summary The overall goal of this proposal is to examine feed-forward laryngeal adaptation in speech and swallowing. Over several decades, the research literature on laryngeal function in speech and swallowing has primarily assumed that sensory feedback drives laryngeal modulation to maintain adequate laryngeal function. In feedback control, sensory input can be used to adjust ongoing movements. In feed-forward control, however, input from previously completed movements are used to predict, plan and execute future movements that have not yet occurred. We posit that a feed-forward paradigm deserves more attention and might be more effective in rehabilitation programs because many aspects of speech and swallowing are inherently under feed-forward control. This is because feedback modifications may not be possible in (a) swallowing laryngeal movements that are ballistic or in (b) very short speech sounds or early voicing periods. We hypothesize that laryngeal function in healthy adults is remarkably accurate in speech and swallowing because errors can be avoided before they occur due to feed-forward control. However, in individuals with neurogenic dysarthria and dysphagia, we hypothesize that continued dysfunction could be due to impaired laryngeal feed-forward adaptation. We will test this hypothesis with 2 Aims. Aim 1 is to differentiate feed-forward laryngeal adaptation among cerebral stroke, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), and healthy controls when (1A) speech is perturbed with respiratory loading to restrict vocal loudness and (1B) swallowing is perturbed with neck electrical stimulation to restrict laryngeal elevation. Aim 2 is to examine whether laryngeal adaptation outcomes in patients with cerebral stroke and ataxia correlate with dysphagia and/or dysarthria severity over a period of one year. Our preliminary data suggest that feed-forward laryngeal adaptation is fine-tuned in healthy adults. This is characterized by adaptation of only laryngeal functions that are essential to overcoming the perturbation, while other non-essential laryngeal functions remain stable. Conversely, patients with cerebral stroke and SCA6 do not have fine-tuned laryngeal adaptation. Instead, extraneous movements during the perturbation might be interfering with ongoing error-reduction processes. These two patient groups offer a unique opportunity to examine the differential effects of cerebral versus cerebellar contributions to laryngeal adaptation and control in naturally occurring human models of disease. This grant is the first step in our long- term goal to establish that speech and swallowing rehabilitation might be more effective if feed-forward control principles are incorporated. The scientific rigor of this study and the strength of the team assure that outcomes will impact future directions of sensory-motor adaptation across several other systems of the body."
"9418039","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young MSM, are more likely to contract HIV than White MSM. Research thus far has been unable to account for the mechanisms driving this racial disparity, as HIV research has largely targeted individual risk factors, but Black MSM consistently report comparable or fewer of these behaviors than other MSM. In addition, little research examining racial disparities acknowledges that substance use and other HIV risk behaviors are socially and spatially dependent; thus, differences in network and venue affiliation may shape the risk environments and behaviors of YMSM of different racial groups, and may be key in understanding differences in HIV. Emerging research with Black MSM documents racial differences in the network, venue, and neighborhood affiliations of YMSM. These findings suggest that although rates of drug use and other HIV risk behaviors may be lower among Black YMSM than other racial groups, their consequences may be different due to the nature of the risk environments experienced by these young men. The overall objective of this project is to contribute to knowledge about structural mechanisms (e.g., stigma and discrimination) that shape these risk environments, which in turn shape consequences of substance use and other HIV risk behaviors for young Black MSM. However, appropriately interpreting the empirical data describing these social and cultural contexts (i.e., the structure of social, sex, drug, venue, and neighborhood affiliation networks) i problematic without the incorporation of the voices, lived experiences, and knowledge of participants. Therefore, the innovative mixed methods approach proposed by this project will guide the interpretation of network-level structures captured within an existing NIH-funded cohort of YMSM. Three phases will occur in which network and geographic data is visualized (Phase 1) and used to guide interviews with YMSM, leading to a theory of mechanisms and functions in this population (Phase 2), which will be subsequently tested using multilevel modeling (Phase 3). The overall project has two aims: 1) identify how networks, venues, and neighborhoods operate as risk environments that shape the consequences of substance use and HIV risk behavior for YMSM of different racial groups, and 2) identify how structural mechanisms, such as stigma and discrimination, influence the networks, venue attendance, and neighborhood affiliations of YMSM of different racial groups."
"9545976","PROJECT SUMMARY Currently over 5 million people are living with Alzheimer?s disease (AD) in the US. Unfortunately, no disease modifying therapies are yet approved, resulting in an enormous unmet medical need and burden on society. Genetic studies on patients with Late Onset AD (LOAD), which accounts for the vast majority of AD, point to defects in microglial function as the cause. Recently, we and others have identified mutations in the gene encoding TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) that correlate with a significantly increased risk of developing LOAD. In particular, the TREM2 R47H variant is associated with a risk similar to that of APOE4, previously the only well-established risk factor for LOAD. In the central nervous system, TREM2 is selectively expressed on microglia and is recognized to regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines, phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons and cell survival. TREM2 is a type 1 membrane protein of the Ig superfamily with a short cytoplasmic tail that interacts with?and signals through?DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12). In an exciting development, we and others have shown that TREM2 binds APOE and Clusterin (another apolipoprotein linked genetically to AD) and that mutations in TREM2 (e.g. R47H) reduce the binding of these ligands and also of oligomeric A?. Our current hypothesis is that impaired signaling through TREM2- DAP12 results in an altered immune response by microglia and this contributes to AD pathogenesis. In this revised application, we propose a high throughput screen of a large chemical library to identify compounds that bind to and modulate the function of TREM2 as a first step in translating these new biological insights into therapeutics. An innovative protein thermal shift (PTS) assay has been established that uses purified TREM2 to identify compounds that bind. This assay has been fully optimized in a 384 well format and as a demonstration of assay readiness, 45,000 compounds have been screened (Z?-parameter >0.7). Multiple hits from pilot screens were identified that dose dependently stabilized TREM2-but not control protein. A battery of downstream assays has been developed to establish a critical path-testing funnel. Specifically, orthogonal biophysical assays to confirm that hits physically bind TREM2 and secondary cellular assays to evaluate if hits affect the shedding of TREM2, alter the phosphorylation state of DAP12, and/or affect the activation state and properties of microglia. This proposal builds on data from the applicants, an established team from Sanford Burnham Prebys (Drs. Jackson, Sergienko and Xu) and Tanz CNRD, University of Toronto (Dr. St. George- Hyslop) who have been working together for the past 2 years, supported by philanthropic funds. The overall goal of this proposal is to generate a ?toolbox? of chemical probes (agonists, antagonists, allosteric modulators) that can be used to explore the biology of TREM2 and its role in LOAD. As the critical path assays are all in place, we anticipate we can rapidly obtain such probe molecules and start to explore their activity and ultimately their suitability for hit-to-lead and future in vivo evaluation in animal models and eventually patients."
"9449433","Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent and endogenous antimicrobial/antiviral agent normally present at moderate levels (200-1000 ppbv) within the upper airways/sinuses of healthy patients, helping to prevent chronic upper airway infections. Patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and other conditions with difficult-to-treat lower respiratory infections?chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF) and others?could potentially benefit from home treatment with inhaled NO therapy (iNO). While iNO at much higher levels (10- 50 ppmv) is used routinely in hospitals for neonatal pulmonary hypertension and adult acute respiratory distress syndrome, the extremely high cost of current iNO systems ($3,000 per day) precludes their use for home treatment of respiratory tract infections associated with CRS, COPD and CF. For such disorders, administration of doses of NO that mimic levels normally found in the upper airways of healthy individuals could be a safe and effective method of preventing or treating upper and lower respiratory infection. Herein, we propose to study a new low-cost delivery strategy to generate pure nitric oxide (NO) for iNO therapy, which could be used in the hospital or at home for certain clinical situations where no standard chronic treatment currently exists (e.g., CF, COPD, and CRS). We hypothesize that by encapsulating the stable NO-donor, S- nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), into common polymeric tubing for iNO therapy, light-activated release of NO can be achieved to yield controlled therapeutic NO levels in the carrier air gas. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will characterize the variables of light active NO release from SNAP-loaded tubing into an airstream. We will load SNAP into polymeric tubing and ambient air will be delivered through the tubing while initiating photolytic NO release with a flood lamp. NO will be monitored to assess how formulation variables in the SNAP-loaded tubing influence the levels and lifetime of photolytic NO release. In Aim 2, we will combine LED light and a new NO sensor with the optimal SNAP-loaded tubing formulations from Aim 1 to monitor and achieve therapeutic NO levels. We will test how varying humidified air flow rates with optimal tubing type, geometry and SNAP loading can provide continuous, stable levels of NO within the target range of 200-2000 ppbv within an air stream for at least 10 h, using sensor signals to control LED intensity. In Aim 3, we will examine controlled iNO delivery using the system devised in Aim 2 for its ability to kill bacteria in vitro. We will grow biofilms of P. aureginosa and S. aureus and expose them for various times to specific iNO levels in a range of 200-2000 ppbv with humidified air. Biofilm biomass and viable bacteria will be determined to assess iNO effect derived from the SNAP-loaded tubing. Human tracheal epithelial cells grown on a semipermeable membrane at the air/liquid interface will also be treated with the iNO approach to prove that the produced NO levels have no adverse effects on these cells. The effect of various NO levels produced from the SNAP-loaded tubing on biofilms grown on the surface of the human epithelial cells will also be examined."
"9431210","Project Summary/Abstract  In the previous project period we completed our 3D histomorphometric characterization of connective tissue deformation and remodeling in early through end-stage monkey experimental glaucoma (EG). Based on those findings, in this renewal proposal we will seek to identify important molecular and cellular components of optic nerve head (ONH) connective tissue and retrolaminar myelin remodeling in monkey early experimental glaucoma (EG). In so doing we will identify age-related differences in these phenomena and provide unprecedented microscopic support for their early in vivo detection by optical coherence tomography (OCT).  In Aim 1 we will phenotype the ONHs of young and old monkeys with unilateral early EG using quantitative proteomic, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH) and electron microscopy (EM) techniques. We hypothesize that connective tissue and retrolaminar myelin remodeling are core components of ONH aging and glaucoma and will test predictions regarding their timing, and character in monkey early EG relative to the development of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) cytoarchitecture disruption, alterations in the ONH constituent cells, and the presence of wound healing, inflammation and monocyte/macrophage infiltration. In Aim 2 we will explore our hypothesis that the pathophysiology of ONH aging overlaps with glaucoma by testing two predictions regarding old vs young Control eye differences in the Aim 1 data: first that they will share important features of EG vs Control eye differences in monkeys of all ages; and second that they will also share important features of old vs young EG eye differences in monkey early EG. In Aim 3 we will accurately colocalize Aim 1 IHC/ISH/EM findings to sacrifice-day OCT B-scans of the same eyes so as to provide light and electron microscopic validation in monkeys for ONH OCT detection of early glaucoma damage in humans. To accomplish these aims we will employ: state of the art quantitative iTRAQ Mass Spectroscopy; our novel strategy for quantitative ONH IHC/ISH; quantitative transmission and scanning block face EM; precise anatomic colocalization of each IHC/ISH paraffin and each EM vibratome section to OCT B-scans, retrolaminar optic nerve (ON) axon counts, and sacrifice day OCT change-from-baseline data. All outcomes will be reported in anatomically consistent, 30º degree ONH sectors that are oriented relative to the foveal-BMO axis.  Aim 1 will generate the first quantitative proteomic characterization of the monkey ONH, peripapillary scleral (pp-scleral), ON and retinal tissues in early EG. IHC/ISH and EM studies will demonstrate that connective tissue and myelin remodeling are present at an early stage of RGC axonal insult. They will also detect alterations in the ONH and pp-scleral tissues and cells that include proliferation, phagocytosis, myofibroblast differentiation, wound healing, monocyte infiltration, and inflammation. Aim 2 will confirm that proteomic, IHC protein expression and EM differences in old versus young control eyes share important features with early EG vs control eye differences in monkeys of all ages. Aim 3 will provide the first rigorous microscopic validation of deep ONH visualization and early glaucoma ONH change detection by OCT."
"9664021","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in females with cancer. In 2013 approximately 232,340 new cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed, where an estimate of 39,620 was expected to succumb to their disease. It is estimated that one in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. Breast cancer is classified into subtypes based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The presence or absence of these molecular markers has been used to estimate clinical prognosis and to determine treatment response to current breast cancer therapies targeting these pathways. Despite these therapeutic advances, breast cancer patients that have undetectable ER, PR and HER2, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cannot benefit from these targeted treatments. Cytotoxic chemotherapy continues to be the primary treatment option for TNBC patients, which typically have poor prognosis and significantly lower overall survival when compared to patients that are ER and/or PR positive. Thus, there is a major unmet medical need to develop effective long-term therapies for resistant breast cancers, including TNBC.  Resistant tumors are able to survive and thrive in the hostile tumor microenvironment with low nutrients and oxygen by adapting to such toxic milieu through various survival mechanisms, such as sustained unfolded protein response (UPR) or persistent endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and autophagy. The hallmark of ERS is the enhanced expression of chaperone proteins that facilitate the clearance of misfolded proteins, and as a result they promote anti-apoptotic mechanisms and enhance cancer cell survival. The overexpression of these chaperone proteins can also confer resistance towards cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, it is not surprising that tumor cells with chronic low level of ERS are able to survive and even thrive in inhospitable environments, including cytotoxic chemotherapy. This project is supported by our findings that even a small increase in the ER stress levels in tumor cells can surpass a certain threshold where it triggers apoptotic cell death specifically in tumor cells.  Based on our investigations of this novel concept, we identified a lead compound, which was shown to have efficacy and safety profile suitable to advance for human evaluation. This small molecule was found to be active in a wide range of cancers including, lung, brain, breast, and colon cancers, and was shown to be active alone and in combination with conventional chemotherapy in TNBCs.  This project will support the advancement of our lead compound towards clinical development. This will be accomplished by establishing the optimal dosage and frequency when used alone and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, and by determining its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These efforts will set the stage for completing the preclinical studies of this promising compound, and will help advance it towards clinical studies for resistant breast cancers, including TNBC."
"9440316","Project Summary Mitochondria were once simply considered organelles that generate ATP but are now known to impact aging and age-related diseases through their myriad effects on nuclear transcription and translation. Maternal transmission of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) could be prevented by mitochondrial replacement therapy. This cure, however, risks inducing mitonuclear conflicts, whose effects may not become apparent until late in life and may differ between the sexes. The proposed project will develop the crustacean Tigriopus californicus as a new model for the effect of mitochondria and mitonuclear interactions on sex-specific aging, including assays of mortality rate, mtDNA content, oxidative stress and gene expression. The species is particularly suited for experimental work in that is easily raised in the laboratory, has a short life cycle, is amenable to multiple generations of controlled crosses and has abundant genomic resources (including full genomes and transcriptomes for multiple populations). Further, it is an emerging model for understanding mitonuclear interactions, in part because viable and fertile hybrids are easily produced in crosses between populations with tremendously divergent mtDNA. The system also has the advantage that sex-specific mitochondrial effects will not be confounded by the presence of sex chromosomes, because the species does not have sex chromosomes (instead, sex determination is polygenic). This study will focus on reciprocal F1 crosses between two populations at ~19% mtDNA divergence, with substantial differences across all 37 loci, including non-synonymous changes for all 13 protein coding loci. Replicated parental and reciprocal F1 lines will be assayed for sex-specific mortality rate, lifespan, mitochondrial DNA content and deletion ratio, oxidative stress (ELISA quantification of 8-OH- dG) and gene expression (RNAseq). Weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA) will be used to identify nuclear gene modules that share co-expression networks with mitochondrially- encoded genes, and to relate modules to aging phenotypes. Development of this new model system will broaden our understanding of the mitochondrial basis of aging, and will provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess effects of mutations throughout the mitochondrial genome."
"9467214","Project Summary Alcohol use disorder is a chronic relapsing disorder that is a significant burden to afflicted individuals and society as a whole. Many adult alcoholics began to drink excessively during adolescence, and this early exposure may result in increased vulnerability to developing a lifelong addiction. The brain continues to mature throughout adolescence, and exposure to alcohol during this critical period may disrupt brain development, thereby predisposing the development of alcohol use disorder. For example, it has been suggested that the development of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region critical to the regulation of motivated behaviors, can be adversely affected by cycles of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal during adolescence, and disrupted mPFC output is thought to contribute to the behavioral sequelae characteristic of alcohol use disorder. An understanding of how alcohol disrupts the maturation of the mPFC may therefore prove useful in preventing the transition to alcohol dependence. Toward this goal, the studies proposed in this application will make use of a mouse model of binge-like adolescent ethanol self-administration to identify the time course and behavioral consequences of chronic ethanol intake during this critical developmental period. Our lab has previously shown that adolescent binge-like alcohol intake disrupts the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic area that form projections from the mPFC, and that perturbation of currents through hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (HCN channels) may underlie altered mPFC afferent output. Specific Aim 1 will use electrophysiological and immunohistochemical methods to determine the time course of ethanol-related disruption of mPFC HCN channels. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether the hyperpolarization of mPFC projections that arises from this ethanol-related disruption of HCN channels is responsible for the increased ethanol self-administration seen in adult animals with a history of binge-like adolescent intake. The results of these experiments could assist in the identification of novel therapeutic targets for alcohol addiction."
"9545999","Title: Interactions of Perirhinal Tau Pathology and Aging in Cognitive Dysfunction Abstract: Intracellular inclusions comprised of tau proteins are among the earliest pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common age-associated neurodegenerative condition. Data show that tau inclusions initially emerge in the transentorhinal subregion (area 35) of perirhinal cortex by the fourth decade of life, twenty years prior to the typical AD diagnosis. The immediate consequences of this early area 35 tau pathology on cognition and disease progression, however, remain poorly understood. The long-term goal of this research is to develop sensitive cognitive assays for humans that provide a reliable index of early AD pathology. The primary objective of the current proposal is to develop a preclinical model that recapitulates many features of early AD using AAV technology to drive pathological tau burden in area 35 of young and aged rats. The secondary goal of this proposal is to establish behavioral assays as a biomarker for early detection and tracking of disease pathology in patient populations. These goals will be attained by testing the hypothesis that aging exacerbates tau burden in area 35 and that progressive pathology in this brain region is associated with performance on sensory discrimination tasks that utilize perceptual gradients to test stimulus discrimination abilities. The rationale for this this work is that because Alzheimer's disease develops against the backdrop of an aging brain, it is critical to elucidate how aging and pathological tau interact to influence disease mechanisms and cognitive outcomes associated with disease progression. This work is innovative because viral vector technology will be used to model the specific anatomical features of early Alzheimer's disease in conjunction with state-of-the-art cognitive assays that are highly sensitive to detecting behavioral dysfunction associated with aging and disease. The significance of the proposed experiments will be to establish the foundation for developing new diagnostic tools for AD that can facilitate early intervention and more effectively evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics before widespread neurodegeneration occurs."
"9456111","PROJECT ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this Planning Grant (R34) is to conduct a Stage IA and IB pilot of a behavioral intervention for heavy episodic drinking (HED) and violence among college students. In response to high rates of violence on college campuses, federal guidelines recommend universal violence prevention. However, violence prevention is less effective for individuals who engage in HED. It is imperative to develop and test interventions aligned with theoretically-based and evidence-based models, to target the role of alcohol in sexual assault, provide personalized information relevant to risk and protective factors for HED and violence, and to do so using a mode of delivery that is highly scalable (i.e., mHealth) to address the research-practice gap in college violence prevention. The current project includes the following aims: 1) to modify alcohol and violence prevention content to a personalized mHealth format that addresses risk factors; 2) to obtain usability of the intervention among college students who engage in HED to incorporate user feedback into the intervention content; and 3) to randomize students who engage in HED to an integrated personalized mHealth alcohol and violence prevention program or to a control condition to observe effect sizes and estimate the variability using a 3-month follow-up for designing a larger randomized controlled trial grant application. By accomplishing these aims, we will have established the research team, programming, and feasibility of the research protocol for a large scale, grant application to test the efficacy of this personalized integrated mHealth intervention. This research has the potential to reduce alcohol use among young adults as well as reduce violence among high-risk groups, thereby meeting both NIAAA and national priorities."

"9527381","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research: Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and the systemic histiocytoses (SH) are unique amongst hematopoietic malignancies in that they both harbor a high frequency of mutations in BRAFV600E and MAP2K1. Although these disorders share common molecular alterations, HCL and the SH have very distinct clinical behavior and are suspected to have different lineage derivations. However, the precise biological basis for the differences in their pathogenesis is poorly understood. In addition, the molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic responsiveness of non-BRAFV600E-mutated variant HCL (vHCL) and SH to mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors are also undefined. Finally, the genetic mechanisms for RAF inhibitor resistance recently described clinically in classic HCL (cHCL) patients are unknown. Thus, the primary goal of this project is to determine how BRAFV600E, MAP2K1, and other kinase alterations contribute to the pathogenesis of distinct hematopoietic disorders and affect their clinical responses to MAPK pathway inhibitors. This proposal will utilize banked HCL and SH patient samples and several newly developed in vitro and in vivo murine models to pursue this goal. We expect these studies to establish a paradigm for understanding the pathogenesis of genetically related disorders arising in the same tissue system by incorporating both genetic and developmental biology perspectives, as well as providing new biological and therapeutic insights into MAPK-driven hematopoietic neoplasms. Candidate: Dr. Benjamin Durham is a hematopathologist and molecular genetic pathologist who currently serves as a Genomic Pathology Research Fellow in the Department of Pathology at MSKCC. He aims to become an independent, tenure-track physician-scientist investigating the molecular pathogenesis of hematological malignancies through a combination of genomics, functional genomics, and murine modeling. Dr. Durham has outlined a five-year period of mentored training to strengthen his skills in functional genomics and disease modeling. This training period will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab, a rising leader in the functional genomics of hematopoietic malignancies and Dr. Neal Rosen, an expert in MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling. Dr. Durham has also assembled an advisory committee composed of Drs.

The continuation of the current IEIP surveillance project will provide the historical comparability essential for evaluation of the impact of public health interventions over time. We also propose a set of special research studies on respiratory disease that focus on specific research questions, contribute to multisite projects, and improve understanding of respiratory diseases globally. Key to the success of the proposed projects is our experience conducting the current IEIP surveillance project, and our interdisciplinary team of epidemiologists, clinicians, and laboratory scientists with extensive collaborations with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and with the Guatemala Ministry of Health during the previous cooperative agreement. Important to our approach is our aim to increase collaboration across CDC-funded programs in the region, particularly to strengthen our core expertise in respiratory disease through the Influenza Program and  increase training opportunities within our field projects through the Field Epidemiology Training Program. The impact on local capacity will be substantial because we have developed a work plan that involves increasing participation of Ministry of Health scientists in various aspects of public health surveillance under a long-term inter-institutional agreement."
"9616714","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death in the US and other developed nations. In 2009 alone, more than 80 million Americans suffered from CVD with associated cost $313 billion. The development of CVD and other chronic circulatory disorders has been associated with exposure to drugs and environmental toxicants. These chemicals can alter the bioavailability of a key regulator of vascular function ? nitric oxide (NO), which is produced by endothelial cells (ECs). The impairment of vascular EC NO production can contribute to the development of chronic circulatory disorders. However, this does not explain why some individuals develop the disease and others do not. Accordingly, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences leads in efforts to understand the contribution of individual susceptibility to complex diseases, such as CVD. To aid these efforts, Creative Scientist, Inc. (CSI) is developing advanced tools enabling the generation of data on individual vascular susceptibility to drugs and environmental toxicants. Using proprietary protocols and cell growth media supplements, CSI isolates Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells (ECFC) from small volumes of peripheral blood and cryopreserves the cells. ECFCs are unique primary cells involved in both embryonic and adult vasculogenesis. The donor-specific nature and robust growth potential of ECFCs allow for the testing of tens of thousands of chemicals in cells derived from any number of individuals. Our goal is to commercialize a NO testing service using a novel and highly specific NO reagent and a high content imaging platform. In Aim 1, we will determine the sensitivity and selectivity of our novel NO-specific fluorescent probe. Completion of this Aim will demonstrate the utility of our reagent for measuring basal and induced NO levels in ECFCs. In Aim 2, we will determine the reproducibility of measuring NO levels in different ECFC lineages using different culture conditions (e.g., with inducer, with inducer and inhibitor). Completion of Aim 2 will establish the utility of ECFCs for identification of NO inhibitors. In Phase II, we will test the assay's ability to detect human response variability to 1,000 toxicants using a collection of ECFCs derived from up to 500 donors. Our ultimate goal is to provide a commercial service to regulatory and research agencies and pharmaceutical companies aiming to evaluate the potential vascular toxicity of environmental toxicants and drug candidates in a population and, in particular, trying to identify both sensitive and resistant individuals and/or population sub-groups. The success of our assay development efforts will help subsequently commercialize a stand-alone NO testing kit."

This bacterial infection of the colon is created by the use of antibiotics which kill commensal bacteria, creating an environment in the large intestine which is conducive to the development of CDI. The conventional treatment for most cases of CDI remains metronidazole or vancomycin, two antibiotics which like all other antibiotics also have indiscriminate effects on the bacteria of the gut. These antibiotics are associated with recurrence rates of CDI ranging from 15-25% following the initial episode of CDI. While the incidence of CDI has increased, and as recurrence rates for CDI have continued to rise, the incidence of life threatening forms of CDI now occur in up to 10% of patients with this infection. While this disease has evolved, the conventional therapies available for CDI have remained virtually unchanged for the previous 20 years. The key to improving CDI treatment is to avoid the disturbances to the bacterial component of the microbiome imposed by conventional antibiotics. Our group has published the first and only paper describing the successful in vitro application of bacteriostatic antisense antibiotics targeting C. difficile. Our previous work utilized dequalinium analogues as cationic bola-amphiphiles (CABs) which are used to complex with and deliver antisense phosphorothioate gapmers into C. difficile to inhibit translation of mRNAs important for bacterial survival. The objective of this study is to develop a new class of antibiotics which are antisense in their action, targeting C. difficile while limiting effects on other bacteria. This current study proposal will accomplish this goal through two aims which use methods well established from the scientific community and quite familiar to our group. In our first aim, our multidisciplinary team will synthesize new CABs which have never been described in the literature and which are rationally designed based upon our team of experts who have a rich experience with nanocarriers. We will develop CABs which are excellent at complexing with our antisense gapmers, which are not toxic to colonocytes and which have minimal to no effect on non-difficile bacteria. In our second aim, we will then develop CAB-gapmer nanocomplexes against C. difficile, with the goal of creating antisense antibiotics which are bacteriostatic against C. difficile in vitro, which have little to no effect on other gut bacteria as tested in vitro, and which have no toxicity to colonocytes. Our overall goal is to create a group of well-characterized antisense nanocomplexes which have been thoroughly tested in vitro, allowing for their subsequent testing in CDI animal models following the conclusion of this project."

"9437835","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) is considered a national priority, EBPs remain underutilized in mental health care settings. Quality therapist training programs are necessary to successfully bridge this science-practice gap, however, research has not yet discovered optimal methods to ensure sustainable EBP implementation. Evidence has demonstrated the presence of significant obstacles for the successful administration of implementation efforts, such as high clinician turnover rates (30-60%). These high turnover rates produce considerable costs to agencies and consumers, and threaten the long-term sustainability of EBPs. The prevalence and potency of staff turnover emphasize the need to understand and prevent workforce instability. A mixed method design will be utilized to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence clinicians to leave their agency or stay long-term. This study will provide  strong foundation for intervention research targeting workforce stabilization as a way to support the implementation of evidence-based interventions with the goal of improving client services and outcomes. Advancement of this knowledge will cost a small fraction of what we are paying to maintain a status quo that is costing significant loss in money, time, resources, and patient improvement.  The current study is unique in a number of ways: (1) to our knowledge, this study is the first to separate and examine factors related to turnover and factors related to long-term retention; (2) unlike the majority of research on this topic that use turnover intention as a proxy for turnover, our study will assess the factors associated with actual turnover; and (3) the proposed study is innovative in that it incorporates transdisciplinary collaboration and utilizes theories, empirical findings, and methods from the field of organizational behavior (OB). The unfolding model, from OB, offers a unique advantage to turnover research, because it focuses on the reasons people leave, which offers more direct links to turnover management strategies than traditional turnover models. Ultimately, this research aims to inform staff-retention strategies that can be consistently and systematically employed in community mental health settings to enhance workforce stability, support the implementation and delivery of EBPs, and improve services and outcomes for consumers. If strategies studied in this proposal are effective and feasible, these strategies can be included in other EBP implementation efforts and will have a substantial public health impact in the area of child and adolescent mental health."

"9542564","ABSTRACT The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Signaling by Adhesion Receptors was established in 2000 and has become the premier meeting at the intersection of cellular adhesion and signaling, mechanobiology, and its relevance to physiology, disease, and development. The 2018 meeting subtitled ?Connecting structure, mechanics, and function in cells and tissues,? to be held June 24 to June 29, 2018, at the University of New England in Biddeford, ME, adds another important dimension ? connecting the structure-function relationship of cellular adhesions during homeostasis and pathogenesis. The meeting Chair will be Dr. Christopher Chen and the Vice-Chair will be Dr. Ann Miller. These investigators provide complimentary expertise in these emerging fields. One new goal of this meeting will be to integrate critical bioengineering and clinical perspectives into this expanding and ever more interdisciplinary community. The main objective of the conference will be to share the newest knowledge from research on: (i) cell-cell adhesions and cell-matrix adhesions, (ii) the mechanical regulation of adhesions, and (iii) adhesion and growth factor receptor crosstalk. Furthermore, as the development of novel tools and techniques have advanced our understanding of adhesion signaling at the fundamental level, the program will examine the impact of this field on: (i) tissue remodeling in development and disease, and (ii) clinical applications of adhesion modulation. Lastly, the meeting will introduce emerging topics to promote new frontiers in adhesion signaling. This interdisciplinary meeting is paramount in bringing together scientists with diverse backgrounds in bioimaging, bioengineering, and cell and developmental biology, to not only understand how the structure-function relationship of adhesions is maintained during homeostasis and disrupted in pathologic settings such as cancer, fibrosis, and wound healing but also how to utilize advances in this knowledge to advance tissue engineering and develop targeted therapies. Speakers will include established leaders as well as young investigators of exceptional promise. In addition to plenary talks, the meeting includes lively and highly interactive poster sessions and unscheduled afternoons to foster informal engagement amongst trainees and investigators. Importantly, four junior scientists (trainees or newly appointed young investigators) will be invited to give oral presentations every day of the meeting, for a total of 16 oral presenters that will shape the mentoring culture of the meeting. As an important feature of this meeting, the main conference will be preceded by a two-day Gordon Research Seminar planned by and for pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees in this growing interdisciplinary field. The Seminar will not only provide a forum for future leaders in the field to present their work in oral and poster presentations in a collegial and interactive environment, but also expose these trainees to the latest ideas and opportunities at the interface of adhesion receptor signaling, molecular and cellular biology, and bioengineering, thereby preparing them to further the scientific field."
"9560635","Project Summary/Abstract  Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that arise during chronic HIV infection highlight the remarkable capacity of the human immune system to evolve antibodies that can recognize highly variable and glycosylated proteins. Eliciting these types of antibodies via a prime-boost vaccine however remains a difficult challenge. Recently, structure-based rational vaccine design strategies have reinvigorated the pursuit of an effective HIV vaccine. This approach relies on a high-resolution understanding of the interaction between the sole neutralizing target on the surface of HIV, envelope glycoprotein (Env), and bnAbs that can be used to engineer immunogens designed to recapitulate bnAb responses in naïve individuals. This approach is iterative and relies on the ability to characterize immune responses in animals to such immunogens to refine the immunogen design. Serum neutralization assays and ELISA binding provide an estimation of the elicited immune response but not the molecular details required for rational design. Epitope mapping via alanine scanning, antigen specific monoclonal antibody isolation, and next generation sequencing provide further details, but each has limitations and are very time-consuming endeavors. We have therefore developed a novel method to dissect polyclonal immune responses to provide a complete and quantitative map of the epitopes targeted that is rapid and can inform boosting strategies in real time. By purifying immune complexes formed between Env trimer immunogens and serum antibodies from immunized animals, and imaging them by electron microscopy, we directly visualize polyclonal antibody responses. These responses can be quantitated directly or in combination with deep sequencing and mass spectroscopy. We have shown proof of concept in rabbits immunized with BG505 SOSIP.664 native-like Env trimers, and propose to use our methodology to study a recently completed large non-human primate (NHP) vaccination study (138 animals) that tested various immunization strategies using the BG505 SOSIP.664 platform. Within this study there are animals that did or did not develop potent autologous neutralizing antibody responses, as well as animals that developed some level of neutralization breadth. Hence, we have a unique opportunity to understand the molecular underpinnings of such immune responses, and to delineate phenotypic signatures within the polyclonal antibody responses that can be used to guide HIV vaccine development. Further, our studies can be applied to human serum samples for an upcoming human clinical trial using the same BG505 SOSIP.664 immunogen. And thus, we can generate comparative data between humans and NHPs to improve the utility of pre-clinical animal models that remain an essential component of the iterative rational HIV vaccine design process."
"9524217","Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valve lesions, which affects 9 million Americans, and is known to increase morbidity and mortality. MR occurs due to leakage of blood through the mitral valve and induces volume overload on the left ventricle, elevates diastolic wall stress and causes rapid left ventricular dilatation, ultimately leading to congestive heart failure within 5 years and death. Timely and effective repair of MR is of utmost importance to halt the progression of heart failure, but current options are limited. Open- heart surgery is the current standard of care and has a relatively high risk of post-operative mortality. Transcatheter mitral valve repair, is a new class of technologies in which MR repair is performed on a beating heart using a catheter that is guided to the mitral valve to deploy reparative devices. However, the route to the mitral valve is a challenging path for existing catheters to follow. The complexity associated with their implantation in a beating heart, often leads to failed procedures and conversion to open heart surgery.  We propose to develop a novel intravascular steerable robot that is guided to the mitral valve by multimodality imaging and deploys a novel, low profile device that can effectively repair MR of all forms. In four years, we propose to complete four specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (GT-Desai): Design and develop an articulated hollow robotic catheter probe with multiple degrees-of-freedom to steer the implant towards and beyond the mitral valve opening as well as orient the implant for accurate deployment on the valve leaflet. The robot will have the capability of both proximal and distal roll joint along with a bending link capability sandwiched between the two roll joints; Specific Aim 2 (Emory-Fei): Design a multimodality image-guided navigation and visualization platform that registers and visualizes three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography and X-ray fluoroscopy and provides a real-time image-guided navigation and visualization system for the clinician to manipulate the robot to the destination through an optimal path with a localization accuracy of ? 3 mm; Specific Aim 3 (Emory-Padala): Determine the efficacy of three mitral valve implants of increasing complexity for use with the intravascular robotic system to enable mitral valve repair; Specific Aim 4 (GT+Emory): Validate the safety and efficacy of the steerable robotic catheter system such that its translation to human use is seamless. The integrated system (robot + imaging + implant) will be systematically tested and optimized in pulsatile flow phantoms, ex vivo swine, beating heart human cadavers, and in chronic in vivo studies in swine induced with mitral valve disease.  This highly innovative and interdisciplinary project combines expertise in surgical robotics (Desai-BME, GT), imaging (Fei-Radiology, Emory) and mitral repair devices (Padala, Guyton-Surgery, Emory). We envision that the intravascular steerable robot and implant, guided by multimodality imaging will significantly simplify Transcatheter mitral valve repair, increasing the procedural accuracy and control, and reducing failure rates."
"9439807","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The blood-ocular barriers (BOB) make drug delivery to the ocular tissues, through the systemic route, a challenging task. The role of efflux proteins, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistant proteins (MRPs), as major components of the BOB has already been well established in vitro. However, studies investigating their clinical implication, with respect to blood to eye penetration of substrates, have not been reported as yet. An understanding of the in vivo barrier characteristics of P-gp and MRP and development of noninvasive strategies to overcome efflux mediated by them, at the BOB, could improve ocular drug delivery through the systemic route. This would help avoid the drawbacks associated with direct intravitreal administration. This proposal is based on the novel hypothesis that the functional activity of the ocular efflux pumps can be significantly blocked through topical co-administration of inhibitors and will thus enhance the blood to eye penetration of efflux protein substrates. The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated in our exploratory studies using rabbits as the animal model. In the current application we propose to evaluate, for the first time, the magnitude of the barrier properties of the ocular efflux proteins (P-gp and mrp1) in vivo in wild type and in P-gp and mrp1 knockout rats. The proposal also seeks to further elucidate the various facets of the novel strategy of localized inhibition of the efflux proteins expressed o the BOB with respect to extent and duration of inhibition and effect of topical formulation components. The effectiveness of the topical route will be compared to the systemic route of inhibitor administration, an approach commonly used to block efflux proteins on the blood-brain barrier. Thus, the specific aims of this project are to: (a) evaluate the magnitude of the ocular efflux protein barrier with respect to the systemic route of drug administration using P-gp (mdr1a) and mrp1 knockout and wild type rats, (b) establish the effectiveness of inhibiting the ocular efflux proteins through systemic inhibitor co-administration and (c) delineate the efficiency of the topical route of inhibitor application compared to the systemic route. Results from these studies will provide a deeper insight into the barrier properties of the ocular efflux pumps in vivo. It is expected that topical application of the inhibitors will lead to significantly enhanced ocular tissue concentrations of the systemically administered efflux protein substrates. This will open up the possibility of effectively treating ocular conditions such as endophthalmitis, uveitis and intraocular tumors through the systemic route. It may also provide a means to overcome the drug resistance encountered in some intraocular bacterial infections and ocular tumors, since the topically administered inhibitors may also block the multidrug resistant proteins up-regulated in these cells. It is thus expected that the results from these studies will provide new scientific insights into ocular drug delivery and improve therapeutic options and outcomes."
"9467562","ABSTRACT  Each of the three PROJECTS in this Program will explore the cellular, molecular, and physiological  mechanisms that underlie pediatric dysphagia in 22q11 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS), using the LgDel  mouse, which is an accurate genetic model of the human disorder, as well as related compound mutants and  transgenics. CORE B, Animal Models and Dysphagia Pathology, will facilitate completion of all of the Specific  Aims of these PROJECTS by providing a reliable and consistent supply of thoroughly characterized mouse  models on a well-characterized single genetic background across all PROJECTS. CORE B will provide  standardized genotyping and documentation, training and consultation for PROJECT personnel on working  with mouse models. By centralizing these services, we can ensure the consistency and fidelity of each of the  mouse models across PROJECTS. CORE B also will work with PROJECTS 1 and 3 to perform standardized  assessment of feeding and swallowing, including acute feeding assays and the analysis of the respiratory  pathology resulting from dysphagia. By utilizing a uniform approach to each of these assays, we will ensure  that data from each PROJECT's aims are directly comparable to parallel experiments performed in other aims  by other PROJECT personnel. This will enhance the precise and rigorous integration and management of  genotypic and phenotypic data across PROJECTs in line with the NINDS ?Pre-clinical Rigor? guidelines,  prevent significant duplication of effort, and maximize the investment of Program resources. Consolidation of  the generation and phenotypic analysis of mouse models of dysphagia in CORE B will allow each research  group to focus on key analytic approaches that are their specialties, rather than investing significant time,  training, and effort in the genetic strategies necessary to generate crosses, follow compound genotypes, and  obtain sufficient numbers of experimental animals for rigorous analysis. In addition, we will facilitate phenotypic  assessment of dysphagia, and ensure that phenotypic measures obtained by each PROJECT can be  compared qualitatively and quantitatively to one another. Together, the services, facilities, and training  provided by CORE B will enhance the research productivity and quality of each of the three PROJECTS.  These Core services will result in significant time and cost savings, and permit PROJECT investigators and  laboratories to focus on their research specialties, with ready access to high-quality animal models and  phenotypic assessment of dysphagia.  NARRATIVE  CORE B, Animal Models and Dysphagia Pathology will provide high-quality genetic mouse models of the  human 22q11 Deletion Syndrome that will be used by all three PROJECTS in the Program. Because children  with this neurodevelopmental disability have significant difficulties feeding and swallowing, CORE B will  facilitate the accurate phenotypic assessment of mice that display these same problems. As a centralized Core  facility, we can provide these services with a high level of reproducibility that ensures standardization across  the PROJECTS, minimizes bias and prevents duplication of effort to conserve Program resources."
"9571638","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Two of the greatest challenges in neuro-oncology are the treatment of glioblastoma primary brain tumors and melanoma brain metastases. Both may be treated with radiation and temozolomide, but at best this merely delays the progression of these cancers. Both GBM and melanoma are marked by substantial genetic heterogeneity and by the ability to adapt to targeted therapies. This project attempts to address both problems through targeting a novel signaling hub in cancer, diacylglycerol kinase ? (DGK?). Our prior studies of a microRNA cytotoxic to GBM cells led us to identify its knockdown of DGK? as a major driver of its cytotoxicity, indicating the potential utility of targeting this kinase. DGK? ad its product phosphatidic acid had already been found important in numerous signaling pathways with oncogenic roles, further supporting the potential of DGK? as a target. We recently reported that knockdown and small-molecule inhibition of DGK? causes apoptotic cell death in GBM and melanoma lines, both in vitro and in mouse models. These studies also indicated antiangiogenic effects in vivo and the importance of mTOR and HIF-1? as mediators of DGK? effects in cancer. Since our published report, we have discovered that an abandoned medication found safe in prior clinical trials for a non-cancer indication, ritanserin, is a novel DGK? inhibitor. Importanty, recent reports suggest that DGK? inhibitors have the potential to break T cell anergy and boost cancer immunotherapies. We therefore hypothesize that ritanserin and other novel DGK? inhibitors will be highly effective against GBM and brain metastases from melanoma, both as single agents and in combination with immunotherapy. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will test the effects of putative novel DGK? inhibitors on GBM and melanoma cell phenotype, whether these compounds affect other DGK family members, and assess possible resistance mechanisms. Aim 2 will investigate whether ritanserin and other novel DGK? inhibitors are safe and effective in GBM and melanoma mouse xenograft models. In Aim 3, we will determine in immnocompetent mice whether these DGK? inhibitors increase the local immune response and are synergistic with immunotherapy. Successful completion of the proposed studies will shed light on the biology and therapeutic targeting of DGK? in GBM and melanoma brain metastases, with the potential for rapid translation to clinical trials. This strategy may have broad applicabiity in cancer, acting via direct cytotoxicity to cancer cells, antiangiogenic effects, and enhancing a host of promising new immunotherapies."
"9548896","PROJECT SUMMARY Youth violence in the United States is common and is associated with numerous adverse health, academic, and psychosocial outcomes. Programs aimed at preventing youth violence have shown only modest success. Consequently, researchers have begun exploring additional primary prevention strategies that can augment existing programs, including anti-bullying policies. Though all 50 states have enacted some type of anti-bullying legislation, there is a striking dearth of research on whether, why, and for whom these laws are effective in preventing bullying and other forms of youth violence. Pilot data from our research group has provided some of the first evidence of the impact of anti-bullying laws on bullying behaviors. While promising, these initial studies have several limitations, including a reliance on cross-sectional designs, a limited number of states, a narrow range of youth violence outcomes, and an examination of only one anti-bullying legal framework. Our proposed study addresses these limitations through pursuing three aims. First, we will use longitudinal and quasi- experimental data to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bullying laws in reducing multiple forms of violent behaviors among youth, including bullying, cyberbullying, peer-to-peer fighting and assaults at school, and weapons carrying. We will also examine whether improved school climate mediates the prospective association between anti-bullying legislation and youth violence outcomes. Second, we will evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bullying policies in reducing group-based disparities (e.g., sex, weight, sexual orientation) in multiple forms of youth violence. To address these two aims, our team of legal experts will conduct the first longitudinal content analysis of anti-bullying laws (and amendments) from their inception in 1999 through 2017; these laws will be coded according to 3 legal frameworks. We will link this legal data to two datasets with student- and school-level reports of youth violence, including the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Surveys and the School Survey on Crime and Safety. Third, we will evaluate whether fidelity of implementation of anti-bullying laws impacts youth violence outcomes. To address this aim, we will collaborate with the Maine Department of Education to carry out two panel surveys with school administrators and school counselors to measure the fidelity of implementation of anti-bullying laws. These implementation data will be linked to youth violence outcomes from three data sources in Maine, which will include student reports from 5th-12th graders as well as school reports of substantiated bullying cases. This research is highly innovative in that it uses a multi-method, multi-measure, multi-level, multi- disciplinary approach to pursue these aims. This study will provide the most comprehensive, methodologically rigorous evaluation of anti-bullying legislation to date. Findings will provide actionable evidence for diverse actors, including legislators involved in amending anti-bullying laws; state and local agencies responsible for carrying out provisions of the laws; and students and families who are directly affected by the strategies implemented by their schools to adhere to the law."
"9555827","Project Summary  The expression of emotions through speech is an essential element of human communication, yet individuals with speech impairments who rely on speech-generating devices (SGDs) to talk are largely deprived of this communicative channel. No one should be forced to sound blasé when in fact they?re elated or to sound apathetic when they intend to scold. While certain expressive speech modes are offered by a few currently available SGDs, the range is extremely limited, and the speech often falls short of conveying the desired emotion or intention. Further, the few speech modes provided are generally restricted to a single voice. The proposed project aims to remedy this unfortunate situation by enhancing the rule-based Synfonica text-to- speech system (S-TTS) to make it easy and cost-efficient to add a broad range of consistently recognizable expressive speech modes, all automatically available for all voices offered by the system. S-TTS currently produces speech for American English in a neutral reading mode. In the project, five new expressive conversational modes will be added?neutral, happiness, sadness, and two types of anger (known as hot anger and cold anger). Each mode will be available for four voices: an already existing adult male voice, an already existing adult female voice, and two new child voices (one male and one female) to be developed in the project. Users of S-TTS will be able to customize these voices to create new ones through special voice customization options to be added to the system outside of the project. While the system will be tested through standard types of perceptual tests, the expressive modes will also be evaluated in real-life situations. For this purpose, a simple augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) app that incorporates the S-TTS voices will be developed, and individuals who use SGDs will be recruited to use this app in their daily lives. These individuals will be asked to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the expressive modes for their interactions with others. In general, the project will be a major step toward enabling SGD users to speak in the manner they wish. They will at long last be empowered to express themselves through voices that can reflect their feelings and help them realize their intentions."
"9443664","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current established evidence-based treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are incompletely effective and not universally acceptable, and appear to wane in effect over time despite significant immediate benefit e.g., FDA-approved medication, which shows large acute benefit, leaves a third of children only partially treated even when combined with behavioral treatment, and has not been demonstrated effective beyond 2 years. Additional treatments are needed that are effective with persisting benefit, preferably related to a biomarker predicting treatment response. A good candidate is electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback, called neurofeedback (NF). It is based on 1) observations that patients with ADHD often have excessive theta band (4-8 Hz) quantitative EEG power, low beta band (13-21 Hz) power, and excessive theta- beta ratio (TBR), and 2) theoretical application of operant conditioning to correct this EEG imbalance. Meta- analysis of 6 randomized clinical trials found a large benefit for inattentive symptoms and medium benefit for hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Unfortunately, none of these were blinded. Three of 4 small blinded studies found no advantage for NF over sham, but used suboptimal NF, leaving the situation inconclusive. Because of the expense and time required by NF, there is a public health need to determine whether it has a specific effect beyond the obvious nonspecific benefit of doing a focused activity several times a week with a friendly, encouraging adult who reinforces for attending to the task. Experts in NF, ADHD, clinical trials, statistics, ad data management have joined to design a double-blind sham-controlled randomized clinical trial to answer several pressing scientific and clinical questions in a way that will be credible to all.At each of 2 sites (1 university & 1 NF clinic) 70 children (total N=140) age 7 through 10 with rigorously diagnosed moderate to severe ADHD and TBR>5 will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to active TBR downtraining by NF vs. a sham training of equal duration, intensity, and appearance. To keep both participants and study staff blind, the sham will utilize pre-recorded EEGs with the participant's artifacts superimposed. The sham will be programmed into the equipment via internet by an off-site statistician-guided person who has no contact with participants. Treatment fidelity will be trained and monitored by 2 acknowledged NF leaders in a manner that protects blinding. Multi-domain assessments at baseline, mid-treatment, treatment end, and follow-ups at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years will include parent and teacher ratings of symptoms & impairment, neuropsychological tests, clinician ratings, and quantitative EEG as well as tests of blinding and of sham inertness. Hypotheses include that NF will improve parent- and teacher-rated inattentive symptoms (primary outcome) and other outcomes more than sham, that benefit will persist for 2 years after training, that initial TBR will moderate treatment response, and tha change in TBR will mediate response. Research Domain Criteria and EEG brain changes will be explored, including relationship of TBR to clinical symptoms, executive-function impairment, and sleep."
"9648665","The filoviruses and arenaviruses are NIAID/CDC Category A biodefense pathogens that cause severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever. There are currently no FDA-approved, specific therapeutics against any of these viruses. Investigators in this consortium have recently demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies can provide effective post-exposure protection against these viruses in two or more animal models. Provision of monoclonal antibody immunotherapeutics provides the most economically viable and scientifically proven avenue for pre- or post-exposure therapy. In the armamentarium of this consortium are hundreds of mAbs against these viruses, representing the largest array of antibodies against these viruses yet compiled and including the most effective antibodies known against these viruses. However, we do not what the epitopes of most of these antibodies are, how they function to ameliorate viral infection, or if the currently chosen cocktails are even synergistic. Further, it is largely unknown what sites of the viral glycoproteins are the best targets for antibody intervention. In order to develop these antibodies or cocktails of antibodies for clinical use, we must understand where each antibody binds, which bind to the same or different sites, and which are synergistic and why. This Core (Core D, Mechanistic Structural Biology) will answer these critical knowledge gaps. In this Gore, we are using innovative, state-of-the-art, high-throughput approaches that will allow structural mapping of -100 antibody binding sites per year by single particle electron microscopy. Using these approaches, we will be able to map the epitopes of nearly every anti-filovirus and antiarenavirus antibody known. We will complement these EM approaches by higher-resolution X-ray crystallographic analysis of a smaller set of antibodies of very high interest, chosen for their unique functional capacity and highest efficacy. This information will be used to sort antibodies into groups based on binding site and function. By sorting antibodies into binding site groups, and by integrating essential functional information from the complementary Mechanistic Virology Gore (Core C), we will be able to sort and rank antibodies of each type. We will be able to select the most effective antibodies that bind to each site and determine which combinations among them are most effective. The innovative and state-of-the-art structural studies in this Core will provide information critical to selection and development of the necessary cocktails of antibodies against these emerging and re-emerging public health threats."
"9451650","Project Summary The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a diffuse inflammatory lung disease that has been associated with multiple direct and indirect pulmonary insults. In ARDS, these diverse etiologies share a common histologic pattern known as diffuse alveolar damage in which the alveolar cells are damaged and the alveoli themselves become filled with proteinaceous fluid. As a result, oxygenation is severely impaired. Despite advances in clinical care, mortality remains high and the development of ARDS pharmacotherapy remains a major unmet medical need. Historically, research has focused on the inflammatory processes that underlie ARDS. This led to several clinical trials of anti-inflammatory medications such as corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This strategy sought to limit tissue damage but did not promote restoration of normal lung architecture per se. To date, no anti-inflammatory medication has shown a convincing mortality benefit in ARDS. In this proposal we postulate that one reason anti-inflammatory medications have not shown a convincing benefit may be because the inflammatory cells themselves promote the restoration of normal lung architecture following ARDS. In fact, preliminary data show a link between the inflammatory response and subsequent re- epithelialization. This project will enhance our insight into reparative mechanisms in the lung and bolster a therapeutic strategy that seeks to directly promote restoration of the alveolar epithelium as a treatment for ARDS. The scientific objective of this proposal is to determine how granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), a key regulator of neutrophil homeostasis, promotes alveolar regeneration in a murine model of acid-induced lung injury, which is similar to human ARDS. Preliminary data suggest that these mice recruit fewer neutrophils to the alveoli following lung injury and also demonstrate significantly impaired alveolar repair three days after acid aspiration. The aims of this proposal are thus 1) Elucidate the mechanisms of G-CSF production and understand how it stimulates type II pneumocytes, a key reservoir of progenitor type I pneumocytes, to repair the alveolar epithelium following acute lung injury. 2) Determine the contribution of STAT3 activation in AT2 cells, mediated by G-CSF, to alveolar epithelial regeneration. This proposal's other key objective is to train the candidate in the nascent field of pulmonary epithelial regeneration. This proposal outlines an individualized plan of mentoring, didactic coursework and professional development to help the candidate become a leader in understanding how innate inflammatory responses influence the repair mechanisms in the lung following ARDS."
"9538027","Project Summary This project proposes to assess whether administration of Dkk1-treated endothelial progenitor cells (Dkk1- EPCs) mitigates radiation injury to the bone marrow by promoting concomitant vascular and hematopoietic recovery. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a cell therapy that can be administered >48 hours after injury to rescue victims of radiation exposure from death due to hematopoietic toxicities such as infection, anemia, and hemorrhage. This is clinically relevant as there are likely to be several hundred thousand victims with acute hematopoietic toxicities if a large-scale nuclear or radiological terror attack were to occur. In a mass casualty scenario, treatment is likely to be delayed due to the large volume of victims; however, the current standard of care Neupogen (G-CSF) only has proven survival benefit when administered with the first 24 hours. Therefore, we propose to characterize a novel cell-based rescue therapy for mitigation of radiation injury to the bone marrow. Past work from our laboratory and others has shown that infusion of endothelial cells can accelerate hematopoietic recovery and rescue lethally irradiated mice from death due to hematopoietic syndrome. In this proposal, we show that pre-treatment with Dkk1 stimulates endothelial cells to produce regenerative and angiogenic factors such as epidermal growth factor. Furthermore, we show that allogeneic transplantation of Dkk1-treated EPCs (Dkk1-EPCs) significantly improved vascular and hematopoietic recovery following 5 Gy total body irradiation compared to saline or EPC treatment alone. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Dkk1-EPCs are a potential cellular therapeutic for the mitigation of hematopoietic toxicities in ARS vicitims. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine whether systemic administration of Dkk1-EPCs improves survival in lethally irradiated mice. 2) Determine whether Dkk1-EPCs mitigate injury to irradiate human BM CD34+ cells. 3) Develop a clinical resource of human EPCs. 4) Determine the cellular mechanisms through which Dkk1-EPCs promote regeneration in irradiated mice."
"9534365","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and  care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care."
"9449199","7. Abstract  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used for the diagnosis of advanced osteoarthritis (OA), but is less sensitive for the diagnosis of early OA. There are three major barriers to progress in evaluation of early OA. First, OA is a ?whole organ disease? involving all the principal knee joint tissues. However, many tissues or tissue components such as the deep layers of cartilage, menisci, ligaments, tendons and bone have short T2s and show little or no signal with conventional clinical sequences. Second, distinct proton groups, namely water protons and macromolecular protons are present in most joint tissues. Macromolecular protons in many the knee joint tissues, especially the short T2 tissues have not been investigated with clinical sequences. Third, extensive research over the past two decades has focused on two particular biomarkers for OA: T2 and T1?, with T2 sensitive to collagen degradation, and T1? sensitive to proteoglycan (PG) depletion. The main confounding factor is the magic angle effect, which may result in a several fold increase in T2 and T1? when the tissue fibers are oriented ~54? to the B0 field. This often far exceeds the change produced by disease.  We have developed 3D ultrashort echo time (UTE) sequences with TEs as short as 8 µs that are 100-1000 times shorter than the TEs of clinical sequences. These allow us to directly image ?MR invisible? joint tissues. Recently adiabatic spin-lock imaging has been proposed to measure T1?. Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging has been introduced to assess macromolecular protons. Most importantly, the adiabatic T1? and MT biomarkers are magic angle insensitive. In this proposal, we will further develop a 3D adiabatic-UTE-T1? sequence for magic angle insensitive T1? measurement, and a UTE-MT sequence for magic angle insensitive biomarkers of MT ratio (MTR) and MT modeling of macromolecular fractions and exchange rates. We will further evaluate the 3D adiabatic-UTE-T1? and UTE-MT techniques for evaluation of macromolecules and water components in both short and long T2 tissues in normal knee joint specimens (Aim 1). We expect that the UTE-adiabatic-T1? biomarker will be sensitive to PG depletion, while the UTE MTR and MT modeling parameters will be sensitive to PG and collagen changes in the knee joint tissues. Then we will compare the novel 3D UTE and clinical sequences for quantitative evaluation of cadaveric human knee specimens with normal (n=20), mild (n=20) and moderate (n=20) OA (Aim 2). We expect that the UTE-adiabatic-T1? and UTE-MT sequences will be more sensitive to degeneration in the principal knee joint tissues than conventional clinical sequences. Finally, we will apply 3D UTE-adiabatic-T1? and UTE-MT techniques to evaluate knee joint degeneration in healthy volunteers (n=20) and patients (n=20) 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. We will correlate the MR measures with clinical scores (Aim 3). We expect the UTE measures will be more sensitive than clinical MRI measures to changes in the knee of patients after ACL reconstruction. The study is likely to have a major impact on making early OA diagnosis and monitoring disease progression."

"9449606","We propose to investigate molecular mechanisms that underlie individual differences in psychological well-being (PWB). PWB is a multidimensional construct that encompasses positive emotion, life satisfaction, and sense of purpose and meaning in life, and is more than the absence of negative emotional states. Many prospective longitudinal studies have shown that PWB is associated with better mental and physical health after adjusting for negative emotion and other relevant confounding factors. Indeed, PWB mitigates risks of having suicide ideation, depression, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer's dementia, heart disease, diabetes, and reduces all-cause mortality.  Notably, PWB has a substantial genetic contribution with a heritability of approximately 64%. However, the genetic mechanisms of PWB are largely unknown despite its many important benefits. To address this, we recently performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of positive emotion, a major facet of PWB. We found a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs322931, significantly associated with positive emotion at genome-wide level. This association has since been replicated in two independent datasets. We subsequently found that rs322931 is a cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for microRNAs 181a and 181b (miR-181a/b) expressed in human blood and brain. Intriguingly, miR-181a/b are enriched in the reward-motivation neural circuit and regulate synaptic plasticity and immune functioning in animal studies. Taken together, we hypothesize that miR-181a/b play a role in PWB.  Given these exciting data, we propose to validate and extend our findings, leveraging already collected human post-mortem brain transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and genomic data to elucidate molecular mechanisms of PWB. This unique human brain dataset of 675 individuals, gathered by the NIH-funded Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) over 20 years, provides a rare opportunity to investigate mechanisms of PWB in the relevant organ, i.e. human brain, with 90% power for our proposed analyses.  To that end, we propose the following aims. Aim 1 will validate the genetic findings from our GWAS of positive emotion in 2040 Veterans and MAP participants. Aim 2 will extend our findings by investigating the contribution of brain microRNAs in PWB using both a hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-neutral approach. Notably, microRNAs are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and collectively regulate more than half of the protein-coding genes. Aim 3 will employ innovative systems biology approaches to identify gene networks and key expression regulatory drivers of PWB, as well as determine whether their protein levels are correspondingly altered in PWB.  In sum, this novel and innovative proposal capitalizes on previously collected Veteran genetic samples and human post-mortem brain ?omic? data from the unique NIH-funded MAP cohort recruited over the last 20 years. We plan to combine these data with the ones we will generate and analyze them with innovative systems biology approaches to elucidate molecular mechanisms of PWB. We aspire to elucidate the genetic architecture of PWB to contribute to future efforts in developing biomarker based screening for risk stratification and intervention to enhance PWB and its beneficial effects."
"9469222","Project abstract  The W1282X nonsense mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene causes a severe form of cystic fibrosis (CF) which can lead to respiratory failure. However, the treatment for CF caused by the mutation is inadequate. The CFTR-W1282X gene expresses poorly functional, truncated CFTR protein at a very low level, due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In the context of CF, NMD worsens the clinical outcome of CF patients with CFTR-W1282X mutation by reducing the expression of partially active mutant protein. To develop effective gene-specific therapies for CF, a deeper understanding of the NMD mechanism is needed. NMD requires the deposition of the exon junction complex (EJC) on spliced mRNA. An EJC positioned downstream of a premature-termination codon (PTC) recruits NMD factors, such as SMG6 which mediates endonucleolytic cleavage, a key irreversible step in the EJC-dependent NMD pathway. Our lab showed that multiple downstream EJCs cooperatively potentiate NMD; and synthetic antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) designed to prevent binding of EJCs downstream of PTCs can attenuate NMD in a gene-specific manner. However, what NMD factors mediate cooperative potentiation of NMD is not understood. CFTR-W1282X lies upstream of three presumptive EJC sites. Whether all three EJCs contribute equally to NMD is unknown. Moreover, whether NMD of CFTR-W1282X mRNA depends on SMG6 has not been investigated. The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the role of multiple EJCs downstream of the PTC contribute to the NMD of CFTR- W1282X mRNA. Developing ASOs that target each of the downstream EJCs will facilitate the understanding of the mechanism by which individual EJCs potentiate NMD. First, I will develop EJC- targeting ASOs that could restore expression and function of CFTR-W1282X protein in human airway epithelial cells. Second, I will validate the mechanism by which the EJC-targeting ASOs attenuate NMD of CFTR-W1282X mRNA. I will use RNA-immunoprecipitation to compare EJC binding to CFTR mRNA with and without ASO treatment. Third, while SMG6 is the most likely mediator of EJC-dependent NMD, other NMD factors may play partially redundant roles in NMD of CFTR-W1282X mRNA. This may diminish the role of SMG6 in the NMD of CFTR-W1282X in human airway epithelial cells. I will test whether SMG6 plays a major role in EJC-dependent NMD of CFTR-W1282X mRNA, using RNAi knockdown. Also, I will systematically analyze the impact of each downstream EJC on SMG6-mediated endocleavage, by controlling the number and location of downstream EJCs, using both genetic and antisense-directed methods. Results from this project will provide insights into the NMD mechanism, and provide supporting evidence to establish ASO technology as a strategy to restore CFTR function by NMD inhibition."
"9503646","BACKGROUND: While many adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are identified during drug development, others remain elusive until after widespread exposure in clinical populations. Identifying novel ADRs involves a two- step process: (1) signal detection and (2) signal refinement. Signal detection is a hypothesis generating phase using data mining methods to suggest potential ADRs. Signal refinement is a hypothesis testing phase to confirm or reject the causal link through more rigorous methodology. Signal detection has historically relied on analysis of spontaneously reported ADRs (e.g. FDA MedWatch). However, administrative healthcare databases are now being explored as a complementary data source and novel analysis methods are needed. OBJECTIVES: The underlying objective is to determine whether a core pharmacoepidemiology study design used for signal refinement, prescription sequence symmetry analysis (PSSA), can be successfully adapted for signal detection using national VHA administrative data. The specific aims are to: (1) determine whether signals can be identified using the adapted PSSA method, among a selected set of medications where novel adverse drug reactions have been discovered post-marketing; (2) examine the impact of varying key parameters of the modified PSSA method and determine whether an optimal set of values can be identified; (3) assess the influence of key PSSA weaknesses, including surveillance bias and detection bias. METHODS: We propose to adapt PSSA for signal detection by automating the procedure beyond examining a single, a priori hypothesized ADR, to instead generate measures of association for all events that can be identified using pharmacy and medical encounter data. We have selected 7 medications where novel ADRs were identified post-marketing (e.g. rofecoxib and myocardial infarction/stroke). In Aim 1, we will apply our modified PSSA method to build ADR signal profiles for these medications, using national VHA pharmacy and medical encounter data to identify events, which will generate association measures (sequence symmetry rate ratios) for all possible incident drug and diagnostic events. We will examine the profile for each drug (e.g. rofecoxib) to determine whether a signal for the event of interest (e.g. myocardial infarction/stroke) was detected. We will further assess whether this signal stood out within the overall ADR profile as an obvious target for subsequent refinement studies. In Aim 2, we will conduct a series of sensitivity analyses, each varying one of several key design parameters. These findings will be used to assess which parameters have the greatest impact on the resulting ADR signal profiles, and determine if consistent, optimal parameters can be identified. In Aim 3, we will examine the influence of detection bias through sensitivity analyses varying the censoring window, a key PSSA methods parameter. We will further study the impact of surveillance bias by calculating sequence symmetry ratios for several variables related to the quantity of healthcare services received (e.g. count of outpatient refills, count of outpatient encounters, etc.). These findings will be used to determine whether a statistical adjustment based on these variables could be developed and applied to outcome event signals to minimize the potential impact of these biases. IMPACT: Innovations of this work include the application of administrative healthcare databases for ADR signal detection and most importantly, we are the first to propose this adaptation of PSSA methodology as a basis for ADR signal detection. If this approach proves effective, it could greatly improve the efficiency of existing ADR detection programs, identify novel ADRs earlier, and thereby prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality in Veterans receiving newly marketed medications."
"9598272","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the efficacy of combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) in control of HIV infection, chronic, progressive kidney disease (CKD) causes significant morbidity in HIV patients. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) remain the most prevalent pathological diagnoses in biopsies from HIV patients with CKD in contemporary cohorts. In the U.S., almost 90% of HIV infected subjects with CKD are African American. A landmark discovery associated genetic variation in the APOL1 gene with excess prevalence of advanced, non-diabetic CKD in African Americans, with published odds ratios for a recessive model of disease of 29 for HIVAN and 17 for primary FSGS. Not only do APOL1 risk genotypes independently accelerate CKD progression, subjects with APOL1 risk genotype and CKD do not benefit from current treatment. Although APOL1 kidney disease-associated variants are common (12% of African Americans carry the risk genotype), only a subset of these individuals develop advanced CKD, consistent with a second hit to initiate disease. Our prior studies established a requirement for direct HIV-1 infection of kidney cells in HIVAN pathogenesis, indicating HIV is a model second hit. The biological mechanisms driving the association of APOL1 variants with CKD in African Americans are unknown. Studies published by us and other groups suggest APOL1 expressed in kidney cells mediates disease. Since APOL1 is a gene unique to humans and some primates, we have generated mouse models and cultured podocytes from urine of subjects with APOL1 risk genotypes to discover and model the mechanisms by which HIV-1 infection triggers CKD in susceptible individuals. These tools overcome the limited availability of human samples to test the following hypothesis: APOL1 has an endogenous function in the glomerular podocyte that is necessary to resist environmental stress and maintain podocyte health and these pathways are dysregulated in the presence of two risk variants where clinical disease manifests with the introduction of an environmental stress. We propose two specific aims to identify pathogenic pathways the mediate APOL1-associated kidney diseases: Aim 1: Use comparative genomics to identify candidate pathways mediating APOL1-associated kidney (podocyte) diseases. Aim 2: Use HIV-1 infection as a model trigger to characterize pathways mediating APOL1 regulated defenses to a CKD-inducing second hit to the podocyte. While focused on the APOL1 variant-HIV interactions, these causal pathways may identify mechanisms shared with other APOL1-associated CKDs. Our group is ideally positioned to undertake these studies, including established experts in HIVAN pathogenesis, genetics of chronic kidney disease in African Americans, and state-of-the-art genomic analysis. Understanding the mechanisms by which variant APOL1 associates with CKD is one of the most compelling questions in biomedical science, and these studies could potentially produce data that drives development of novel diagnostics and treatments for CKD in African Americans."
"9664067","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this K23 award proposal is to provide support for the additional training and experience necessary for the candidate, Junko Takeshita, MD, PhD, to transition from recent post-doctoral trainee and current Instructor in Dermatology to an independent patient-oriented investigator with a focus on health and healthcare disparities in psoriasis. Specifically, the aims of this proposal are to identify, defin, and understand disparities between African American and Caucasian Medicare beneficiaries in the treatment of psoriasis. We hypothesize that: 1) initiation of specific psoriasis therapies and persistence on therapies are different between African American and Caucasian patients with psoriasis, and 2) there are important differences in patient-level factors such as perceptions of psoriasis and attitudes towards treatments between the two racial groups that contribute to differential treatment of psoriasis. As clinicians are currently unaware of existing disparities in psoriasis treatment, we seek to shift current clinical practice paradigms with this proposal by newly identifying and establishing an understanding of racial disparities in the treatment of psoriasis with the goal of reducing any identified disparities and ultimately improving treatment and clinical outcomes, particularly among African American patients with psoriasis. A sequential mixed methods approach will be utilized to address the proposed aims: i) first, a quantitative longitudinal cohort study using Medicare data will be performed in order to compare initiation of therapies and persistence on therapies between African American and Caucasian Medicare beneficiaries with psoriasis; and ii) second, a qualitative study, informed by results from the quantitative study, will be performed using semi-structured interviews and freelists in order to identify patient- level determinants of the identified psoriasis treatment disparities between African Americans and Caucasians. In order to achieve these goals, the candidate will need training in three critical areas: 1) use of Medicare claims data; 2) disparities research methods; and 3) qualitative and mixed methods research. The candidate's training plan, which includes a combination of didactic coursework, practical experience through the completion of her proposed research, and directed mentorship from her expert mentoring team over the five year award period, will enable her to launch a successful career as an independent investigator in patient-oriented research and make important contributions to the field of dermatology via the study of disparities in the care of psoriasis."
"9440327","Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the central nervous system, however their role in health and disease remains a mystery. Astrocytes are very heterogeneous in structure and molecular profile. A single astrocyte creates a distinct non-overlapping territory that encompasses thousands of synapses. Their extensive branches and fine processes allow direct communication over long distances, as well as indirect communication through secretion of chemokines and cytokines. Astrocytes are also a significant component of the neurovascular unit as their endfeet processes terminate directly onto cerebral vessels, regulating cerebral blood flow according to metabolic demand. While in vitro models, including primary astrocytes and acute brain slices, have provided great insight into the physiology of astrocytes in health and disease scenarios, it is clear these preparations devoid of the complexity of the role of astrocytes in vivo. Thus, efforts to study astrocyte physiology should be directed as much as possible to the most physiologically relevant system: the intact living brain. We and others have demonstrated through in vivo imaging of intracellular calcium that astrocytes are dynamic players in the brain, and that the progression of Alzheimer's disease pathology alters their morphology and signaling characteristics. More specifically, we determined that in the presence of senile plaques, astrocytes in the brain have elevated intracellular calcium, exhibit hyperactive signaling, and can initiate spontaneous calcium waves. This allows astrocytes to respond to focal pathological insults with both focal and long range responses. These observations demonstrated that astrocytes respond to amyloid deposition with a change in function, but left several fundamental questions unanswered. Here, we wish to extend our previous observations and determine what the contribution of the altered calcium signaling is to the degenerative process that occurs in AD. The use of genetically encoded indicators, specifically expressed in astrocytes, along with in-vivo imaging will allow us to explore the effect of amyloid on astrocyte structure and function at the synapse and the neurovascular unit. We will also determine if the alterations depend on senile plaque deposition, or soluble oligomeric A? and whether the alterations are beneficial or detrimental to brain function. We propose experiments where astrocyte specific increases or decreases in calcium signaling will be evaluated in healthy and diseased brains. Finally, we will ask how clinically relevant manipulation of the amyloid cascade will affect calcium signaling in astrocytes and the degenerative process. These experiments will shed light on the role of astrocytes in the healthy and diseased brain, and will lead to new targets for therapeutic manipulation in Alzheimer's disease."

The following software / hardware components are provided through this upgrade: ? 8 channel parallel transmit functionality (version step 2.3) ? Additional electronic cabinet with 8 independent real-time sequence controllers ? 32 channel receive, 8 channel transmit PTx coil ? Licenses for Master computer ? Licenses for Slave computer ? Z420 Master computer ?

Siemens will provide the hardware, software, installation, and integration. The PTx upgrade is an interface to the included Siemens product 32-channel receive, 8-channel transmit coil, which allows separate RF excitation pulses to be applied to up to 8 transmit coil elements. On each channel, RF amplitudes, phases, frequencies, and pulse shapes can be independently applied. This allows for dramatic improvement in B1-transmit spatial homogeneity compared to the original 1-channel transmit system and enables high quality, large field-of-view brain and body scans. The PTx upgrade also allows for Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) reductions by as much as ~50%, allowing for an additional factor of two acceleration in imaging speed (Homann et al MRM 2011; Wu et al ISMRM 2017). With the next generation Siemens 7T Terra system expected to be released soon with FDA approval for clinical use, upgrading our 7T system to match the 8-channel parallel transmit capability of future Terra systems is necessary for the VA to remain at the forefront of research. The 7T PTx upgrade will facilitate the pioneering of new clinical applications for veteran health across the spectrum, including but not limited to: traumatic brain injury (TBI), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), chronic pain, schizophrenia, addiction, depression, and even cardiovascular disease. We are requesting this 8 channel PTx capability as an upgrade to our 7T system to make it the only 7T MRI system with PTx capability in all of northern California. Critically, not only would this PTx upgrade improve our whole brain neuroimaging capabilities, e.g. lower specific absorption rate (SAR) and improved homogeneity of quality throughout, but it would also expand our system's capability beyond neuroimaging and enable cutting-edge ultra-high field body, cardiac, and musculoskeletal research. Funding this proposal would greatly augment the leading VA research facility for ultra-high field MRI and help keep the VA at the cutting edge of imaging technology development and clinical applications, thereby helping veterans afflicted with disease for which diagnostic tools are not yet adequate or available."
"9528909","The goal of this application is to characterize the properties and differentiation of the multipotent stem/progenitor cells in the cochlea. The mammalian inner ear uses sensory hair cells for mechanoelectric transduction of auditory stimuli and conducts this information to the brain via sensory neurons for hearing. Since the adult cochlea completely lacks this regenerative potential, damage to the sensory hair cells causes irreversible deafness, which is a condition with high prevalence worldwide affecting over 5% of the world's population and approximately one-third of people over 65 years of age. In the past several decades, scientists have developed regenerative strategies, including gene therapy intended to artificially force the inner ear to regenerate or replace lost hair cells and cell therapy to apply developmental cues involved in the generation of hair cells from murine and human ES cells. However, to date, most of these strategies have failed to induce a true post-trauma regeneration of hair cells that leads to functional recovery, and currently we do not have a definitive strategy for auditory repair and regeneration. As a full understanding of how an organ system forms is the prerequisite to finding ways to repair it when damaged, we performed unbiased clonal analysis of individual inner ear cells to address their lineage relationship. We unexpectedly discovered that the cochlea harbors a previously unknown population of multipotent stem/progenitor cells that are capable of giving rise to both sensory hair cells and surrounding supporting cells as well as to different types of cells in the spiral ganglion during not only development but also postnatal maintenance and regeneration in response to injury. Given the desperate need for novel approaches toward auditory repair strategies, our results stimulate further research into the development of new cell-based strategies for auditory regeneration and repair. In this application, we propose to perform single-cell analysis to characterize the properties and differentiation of the multipotent cochlear progenitor population. Delineating a roadmap for hair cell development has major implications for regenerative medicine as it provides critical molecular information that can be used to guide efficient differentiation of a stem-cell into a hair cell fate. !"

We propose instead to use a novel automated linguistic corpus-based approach to language analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language, and leads to measures of semantic coherence from one phrase to the next. It also evaluates syntactic complexity through ?part-of-speech? tagging and analysis of speech graphs. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture thought disorder.  Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we identified a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort, which included decreased semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, and decreased syntactic complexity, including shortened phrase length and decreased use of determiner pronouns (?which?, ?what?, ?that?). These features correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. We further cross-validated this automated approach in a second small CHR cohort, identifying a semantics/syntax classifier that classified psychosis outcome in both cohorts, and discriminated speech in recent-onset psychosis patients from normal speech.  These automated linguistic analytic methods hold great promise, but their use thus far has been circumscribed to only a few small studies that aim to discriminate schizophrenia from the norm, and in our own work, predict psychosis. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the linguistic mechanisms that underlie thought disorder. To address this gap, in response to PAR-16-136, we propose to use the RDoC construct of language production, and its linguistic corpus-based analytic paradigm, to study thought disorder dimensionally and transdiagnostically, in a large cohort of 150 putatively healthy volunteers, 150 CHR patients, and 150 recent-onset psychosis patients. We expect that latent semantic analysis will yield measures of semantic coherence that index positive thought disorder (tangentiality, derailment), whereas part-of-speech (POS) tagging/speech graphs will yields measures of syntactic complexity that index negative thought disorder (concreteness, poverty of content).  This large language dataset will be obtained from two PSYSCAN/HARMONY sites, such that these language data will be available for secondary analyses with PSYSCAN/HARMONY imaging and EEG data to study language production at the circuit and physiological levels. This large language and clinical dataset will also be archived at NIH for further linguistic analyses by other investigators."
"9451996","Our earlier mechanistic analyses of estrogen action in brain led to the discovery that estrogen is a master regulator of the bioenergetic system in brain that promotes glucose transport, glucose metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation. Collectively, the data provided compelling evidence for estrogen as a systems biology metabolic regulator in brain and illuminated compensatory mechanisms consistent with an aging female brain that is starving. For estrogen to function as master regulator of the bioenergetic system in the female brain, estrogen must be integrating nuclear and mitochondrial genomic responses. Further from a systems level perspective, it would be necessary for estrogen to also regulate cytoplasmic signaling mechanisms for real time feedback on the functional outcomes of nuclear and mitochondrial gene transcription. The fundamental issues to be investigated are the mechanisms whereby estrogen integrates bioenergetic responses across two genomic compartments while simultaneously monitoring energetic demand and performance in real time. The proposed program of research is designed to test two hypotheses. First, estrogenic control of the bioenergetic system in the female brain requires: 1) both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes; 2) integration of gene expression across both genomic compartments and 3) activation of rapid signaling cascades to provide real time feedback on bioenergetic performance. Second, we hypothesize that loss of estrogen in the aging female brain leads to a systematic dis-integration of estrogenic control of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes followed by decline in bioenergetic sensing mechanisms. Estrogenic control of the bioenergetic system of the brain and the dismantling thereof has basic, translational and clinical significance. From a discovery perspective the proposed program of research is unique in exploring the mechanisms underlying estrogenic integration of nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression and the real time feedback mechanisms that control the bioenergetic system of the brain. Further, the process by which this control system is dismantled in the aging female brain is uncharted territory of high significance for understanding bioenergetic aging in brain. Translationally, determining the mechanisms underlying the systematic dismantling of estrogenic integration of bioenergetic compartments in brain has the potential to detect therapeutic targets to sustain bioenergetic function in the aging female brain. Clinically, the aging transition of menopause, unique to the female, is a process that dismantles both reproductive ability and potentially bioenergetic capacity in brain. This is particularly relevant to age-related neurological conditions associated with deficits in glucose hypometabolism such as Alzheimer's, depression and multiple sclerosis which have greater prevalence in postmenopausal women. Research proposed herein aligns with NIA Strategic Research Goals A and C and the ?need to better distinguish patterns of brain aging? https://www.nia.nih.gov/about/living-long-well-21st- century-strategic-directions-research-aging and to objectives of Office of Research on Women's Health."
"9558668","ABSTRACT Bone marrow represents a rich source of diverse stem, progenitor and other cells of clinical and research interest including hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), dendritic cells, T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B-cells and others. Currently, these cells are only recovered from living donors through bone marrow aspiration or peripheral blood mobilization. Ossium Health is developing the first clinical and research bank of bone marrow derived cells from deceased organ and tissue donors. While the concept of utilizing this resource for bone marrow cells was first described over 60 years ago, the ability to recover viable material efficiently and the infrastructure necessary to achieve this at even a modest scale simply has not existed. Ossium Health has overcome this by establishing a robust ecosystem comprised of a world-class tissue processor (and Phase III partner), major organ procurement agencies and innovation to, for the first time, allow recovery and banking of this plentiful source of potentially life-saving cells. However, for this bank to reach its full potential, further efficiencies must be advanced and implemented. This Phase I study aims to develop ?smart baking? innovations by optimizing methods of cryopreserving intact marrow in situ within whole bones to allow time for infectious disease, sterility and, if required, HLA testing prior to investing in fully processing donor bones to isolate cellular components. This innovative work will also provide early guidance towards cryopreservation of more complex tissues such as vascular composite allografts (VCA). Additionally, this study will develop an enhanced method for recovering the initial target populations (HSC and MSC) which may increase efficiency by as much as 80% - drastically reducing cost and allowing more readily available and less expensive clinical grade and high-quality research material to be available to meet the growing demands of gene therapy, tissue engineering and basic science investigation."

"9424686","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (hPAP), a disease we previously identified, is characterized by pulmonary surfactant accumulation and respiratory failure due to alveolar macrophage (M?) dysfunction caused by mutations in the genes encoding GM-CSF receptor ? or ? (CSF2RA, CSF2RB, respectively), for which no specific pharmacotherapy currently exists. We also showed that pulmonary GM-CSF is a critical determinate of the alveolar M? phenotype and developed a novel cell transplantation approach ? pulmonary macrophage transplantation (PMT) with extraordinary therapeutic efficacy in an authentic preclinical animal model of hPAP (Csf2rb-/- mice). Our long term goal is to develop an effective definitive therapy for hPAP that is acceptable for use in children, in whom hPAP most commonly occurs. The objective here is to optimize PMT therapy using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived M?s (iPS-M?s) in hPAP model mice. The central hypothesis is that iPS-M?s can be used to generate M?s that recapitulate the phenotypic and functional characteristics of alveolar M?s, permit a deeper exploration of hPAP pathogenesis, and serve as a source of gene-repaired M?s for PMT therapy of hPAP. The rationale, based on our preliminary data, is that the proposed research will establish the feasibility and lay the groundwork for development of a new personalized medicine approach for treating children with hPAP based on autologous PMT of gene-edited iPS-M?s. This hypothesis will be tested in the following three specific aims: 1) Recapitulation of phenotypically authentic alveolar macrophages from iPS cells; 2) An authentic cellular model of hPAP pathogenesis and its correction by genome editing; 3) Pulmonary macrophage transplantation of iPS-M?s as a novel cell therapy. The approach is innovative because it differs from current gene therapy approaches to generate gene-corrected primary M?s using semi-randomly integrating lentiviral vector. The proposed research will: 1) employ advanced iPS cell technology; 2) generate human hPAP-specific iPS cells and iPS-M?s to help elucidate disease pathogenesis; 3) repair mutant alleles with a non-viral, state-of-the-art synthetic endonuclease- mediated genome-editing system (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9); and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of using iPS-M?s for a novel organ-targeted cell and gene therapy (PMT) without a requirement for myeloablation or immunosuppression. The proposed research is significant because it will: 1) identify methods to accurately recapitulate the alveolar M? phenotype from iPS cells, thereby providing a new general approach to study alveolar M?s in health and disease; 2) provide an authentic cellular model with which to study the pathogenesis of hPAP; 3) permit the optimization of a novel therapeutic strategy to simultaneously perform gene repair while minimizing safety concerns related to genotoxicity from insertional mutagenesis caused by viral vectors; and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of PMT therapy of iPSC-M?s as a novel personalized medicine approach to treat children with hPAP."
"9416614","Project Summary/Abstract: CTDP1 Regulates FANCI and the Response to DNA Interstrand Crosslinks RNA polymerase II subunit A C-terminal domain phosphatase, CTDP1, is the only phosphatase in the human proteome that contains a BRCA1 C-Terminal (BRCT) domain. This modular domain only exists in a small and specialized group of proteins that mediate the DNA damage response (DDR), but the role of CTDP1 in this process has not been delineated. Analysis of the BRCT interactome has identified protein interactions that occur between CTDP1 and the Fanconi anemia (FA) protein FANCI, which is required for the resolution of DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) lesions and resistance to ICL-inducing agents mitomycin c and cisplatin. Preliminary results indicate that CTDP1 expression promotes FANCI activation and represses cellular sensitivity to the ICL-inducing compounds mitomycin c and melphalan. Repression of CTDP1 expression is also associated with an increased accumulation of cells in S-phase of the cell cycle under both normal growth conditions and in response to ICL. CTDP1 expression is required to facilitate ICL-induced FANCI interactions with DNA repair proteins, including the DNA damage foci protein ?H2AX. These results represent the first reported protein interaction between FANCI and a phosphatase that can regulate its function. Thus, the central hypothesis of this research is that CTDP1 is required for the cellular response to ICL damage through the regulation of FANCI activation, and that targeted inhibition of CTDP1 can sensitize cells to ICL-causing chemotherapeutics. The Specific Aims of this project are: 1) To characterize the impact of CTDP1-mediated FANCI phosphorylations on FA pathway response to ICL; 2) To characterize the impact of CTDP1 inhibition on ICL sensitivity in an orthotopic model of breast cancer; and 3) To identify small molecule inhibitors of CTDP1 using high-throughput screening. These experiments will utilize phosphoproteomics to characterize the temporal regulation of phosphorylation sites on FANCI regulated by CTDP1 following DNA damage. Xenograft models of breast cancer will be used to determine the effects of CTDP1 inhibition on cancer growth, metastasis, and response to cisplatin using in vivo imaging. Virtual and physical high-throughput screening of potential CTDP1 BRCT-FANCI protein interaction disrupting compounds will be completed, and selected lead compounds will be validated western blot analysis of CTDP1 regulated phosphorylation events on FANCI and RPB1. Successful completion of this research will lead to a detailed understanding of the CTDP1-mediated regulation of FANCI and the ICL DNA damage response, which could be used to sensitize crosslinker resistant cancers to DNA damaging therapies."
"9272760","Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop an innovative STEM online game that combines biology education about parts of the human body while also teaching about the bad health effects on the body of smoking and other tobacco use. The target audience is students in grades 5-8, which lines up with health curriculum coverage of these topics in most states. The entertaining and challenging aspects of the game will keep the attention of the student much longer than current methods, such as reading print materials or viewing a DVD video. The Phase II work will a) expand the scope and enhance the quality of the prototype version that received positive teacher and student reaction in Phase I trials, b) expand the evaluation research in methods and student population, and c) establish a workable commercialization plan for the game product in the K-12 education market. The game is a free navigation application taking place in an old castle in which the student searches for objects that will allow him/her to rescue a character imprisoned by tobacco enemies. In the process the player encounters information about tobacco use and its health consequences for the human body, often requiring a demonstration of learning by the student to proceed successfully. The ?Dusty the Dragon? character serves as a guide, assisting the player when needed. Health issue content, displayed in on-screen text or video clips, includes information on cancer, oral cancer, heart disease, lung disease, gum disease, and nicotine addiction, and the human organs affected by these diseases. Challenges consist of finding hidden objects, collecting information to apply to answering biological health questions, selecting messages for an anti-tobacco ad campaign, and other game-like activities. When a challenge is successfully completed, the player receives resources that will help him defeat the dangerous cigarettes, e-cigs, cigars, and chewing tobacco containers roaming the castle rooms and halls. The game is designed to be appealing to both boys and girls. It will be evaluated in six elementary and middle schools, chosen to represent a sampling of urban and rural schools and racial and ethnic diversity. User testing, with both students and teachers, will be conducted to evaluate the usability, feasibility, and effectiveness of the game."
"9432764","Summary As prescription opioid use and heroin use has reached epidemic proportions, there has been a corresponding increase in infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS is a postnatal withdrawal syndrome usually caused by in utero opioid exposure, and one infant is born every 25 minutes in the United States with signs of drug withdrawal. Nationally, NAS rates increased nearly five-fold from 2000 to 2012, and substantial state-to-state and rural/urban variation exists. States have enacted a variety of policy responses to address the dramatic rise in NAS rates, some of which directly target NAS or women of childbearing age, while others are designed to decrease the overall number of individuals using opioids or suffering from opioid use disorder. There has been a paucity of empirical studies examining to what extent different state policy approaches are associated with variation in NAS rates at the sub-state level and within key subgroups (e.g., rural residents, Medicaid-enrollees). Furthermore, it is not known whether policies differentially influence NAS rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, populations who historically have been disproportionately impacted by drug laws, populations with less access to healthcare, and different populations of women who use opioids in pregnancy (e.g., who are prescribed opioid analgesics, receive medication-assisted treatment, and/or have an opioid use disorder). In this proposal, we will use two complementary data sources to 1) estimate NAS rates for key subgroups over time to determine variation in rates at the sub-state level using data from multiple states; and 2) characterize the association between variation in NAS rates and state-level policies likely to influence NAS overall and among historically disadvantaged populations. This exploratory analysis will lay the groundwork for a subsequent R01 study that will assess the impact of state policies on NAS rates overall and among key subgroups. The goal of this preliminary study and the planned subsequent R01 proposal is to facilitate more informed policymaking to prevent adverse outcomes for women and infants impacted by the opioid epidemic."
"9529845","PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer?s disease, the most common neurodegenerative disease associated with aging, afflicts approximately 5 million people in the US, costing well over 200 billion dollars annual. Genetic, pathologic, and limited treatment data suggest that age-associated increases in beta-amyloid (A?) peptides, which aggregate and form deposits, play an important role in initiating and potentiating the disease process. This so-called amyloid hypothesis has led to a major focus on understanding A? dynamics and offered important insights for developing AD therapies. However, to ensure the development of a robust battery of A? therapies, novel approaches to understanding A? dynamics must also be taken. In three different human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) mouse models, we and others have shown that infection with the neurotropic parasite Toxoplasma gondii decreases A? deposition by > 60%. How T.gondii infection protects against A? remains unknown. The goal of this grant, therefore, is to use T.gondii infection as a model to identify infection-mediated CNS changes that decrease A? deposition. T.gondii is a ubiquitous intracellular parasite that naturally establishes a life-long, asymptomatic CNS infection in both humans and rodents, suggesting that T.gondii and the mammalian CNS have co-evolved. This co-evolution provides a unique tool to find A?-altering CNS pathways that would not be discoverable by other mechanisms. Given the broad range of cellular and immune cell changes in a chronically infected brain, we hypothesize that T.gondii?s protection against A? is multi- factorial and will involve both changes in cellular production and processing of A? and increased A? clearance by innate immune cells (e.g. persistent infiltration of highly phagocytic macrophages). To test this hypothesis, we will leverage our novel finding that of the three genetically-distinct, canonical strain-types (type I, type II, and type III), only infection with a type II strain protects against A? deposition. By comparing CNS changes provoked by protective (type II) and non-protective (type III) T.gondii strains, we can hone in on the changes linked to protection rather than those associated strictly with infection. Using this comparative analysis, we will identify type II-only changes in the canonical pathways involved in production, cleavage and processing, and degradation of A? (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will determine how type II infection changes innate immune cell infiltration, polarization, and phagocytosis to protect against A? deposition. The successful completion of these aims will determined if the A?-protective effect of type II T.gondii is driven by changes in APP/A? processing or by changes in CNS innate immune cells or both. These findings will form the foundation for future long-term, mechanistic studies to understand the upstream pathways that lead to the remarkable A? protection provoked by type II infection. Harnessing the T.gondii-CNS interaction will lead to new insights into disrupting A? pathways, offering new highly-needed therapeutic targets."
"9435124","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Humans, like all primates, use both eyes in tandem to compute a perceptual interpretation of the visual world. However, binocular vision often fails, causing some of the most common visual disorders such as amblyopia, strabismus, diplopia or stereoblindness. Collectively, binocular visual deficits affect ~10-20% of the population, and the associated problems are generally intractable. Unraveling the neural circuitry that performs binocular integration, which is the goal of the present project, is a critical stepping-stone for developing novel and effec- tive therapeutic approaches. Here, we will fill a pressing gap in our current knowledge about the brain locations and mechanisms that support interocular interactions (cross-talk) between the retinal output of the two eyes. It is still unclear whether the two eyes' signals first meet in the cortex or already interact subcortically. While some data collected in anesthetized cats point to early cross-talk between the two eyes' signals within the tha- lamic relay, other data suggest that this is not the case. The goal of this grant is to resolve the uncertainty be- tween these two alternative possibilities. We will address the question whether there is cross-talk between the two monocular channels before the level of V1 using an innovative, integrative approach that combines simul- taneous multi-electrode array recordings with targeted neuropharmacological and optogenetic interventions. We will answer two fundamental questions. First, we will determine the degree of binocularity of M, P and K neurons in the LGN. We will do so using LGN recordings combined with cell-type specific optogenetics in awake macaques confronted with varying contrast levels during binocular stimulation. As a second step, we will eliminate feedback to the LGN by reversibly inactivating V1. Using laminar arrays, we will determine the residual activity in LGN as well as the current flow in inactivated cortex, which provides a measure of LGN feedforward inputs to V1. The outcome of all experiments combined will conclusively determine the respective roles of primate LGN and V1 for binocular integration, which is of great significance for our general understand- ing of primate vision and associated clinical implications. Without resolving these questions, models of binocu- lar vision will be incomplete or inaccurate, which will hamper medical progress for correcting disorder of bin- ocular vision, such as amblyopia and stereoblindness, which collectively affect one out of every ten people worldwide."
"9430418","Project Summary We, and others have demonstrated that HIV-1 infects and preferentially depletes a majority of gastrointestinal (GI) CD4+ T cells within 2-3 weeks of infection. However, while GI mucosal T cells are well studied, there is very little information on the impact of HIV-1 on mucosal B cells. There are multiple reasons to study the mucosal B cell compartment in HIV. First, it is clear that B cells are critical to mucosal homeostasis through complex and wide ranging effects on the microbiome, the epithelial surface, and the resident innate and adaptive immune system. Second, dysfunction of systemic B cells is considered to be a hallmark of HIV-1 pathogenesis. And finally, that the intestines harbor the largest reservoir of B cells in the body. Therefore, we contend that studying mucosal B cells is central to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection in the mucosal and systemic compartments.  In our preliminary studies we demonstrate a striking loss of Naïve B cells from the GI tract of patients with acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) and multiple perturbations within GI B cell subsets during viremic, chronic HIV- 1 infection (CHI). These results support our hypothesis that HIV-1 results in major and perhaps irreversible alterations within the mucosal B cell compartment that are pivotal to the ensuing dysfunction of the mucosal immune system and contribute to the impaired integrity of the mucosal barrier. The proposed research will be carried out through a collaborative effort between three laboratories with distinct and complementary expertise uniquely suited to address the central hypothesis of this application. The PI of this application, Dr. Saurabh Mehandru is a trained gastroenterologist with more than 12 years of experience in the study of intestinal lymphocytes. Dr. Mehandru has made several key contributions to our understanding of the effect of HIV-1 infection on the GI immune system. Dr. Andrea Cerutti is world-renowned expert in B cell biology, mucosal immunology and studies of B cell dysfunction in HIV-1 infected individuals. Dr. Michel Nussenzweig, also the world's leading expert on B cells has pioneered the therapeutic use of innovative, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in HIV-1 infected patients. In addition, the research will be done in close collaboration with Dr. Judith Aberg, Head of Infectious Diseases at Mount Sinai and Dr. Uri Laserson who has an established track record in analyzing the clonal repertoire of B cells in HIV-1 infection. This proposal will allow us to comprehensively immunophenotype GI mucosal B cells, determine the impact of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on mucosal B cell reconstitution and correlate changes within mucosal B cells with CD4+ T cell depletion and mucosal barrier function defects (aim 1); map the clonotypic architecture of mucosal B cells before and after cART and bNAb therapy (aim 2); and study the effect of two bNAbs on the GI immune system and the level of HIV-1 within the GI tract (aim 3)."
"9554396","Project Summary  Despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, nearly half of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV experience neurocognitive impairments (NCI) that negatively impact daily functioning. HIV-associated NCI is estimated to be the most common form of midlife NCI worldwide. Drug abuse, a highly prevalent comorbidity in HIV+ persons, increases the risk of HIV-associated NCI. Unimodal MRI studies have shown that HIV and drug abuse are each linked with a distinct set of structural and functional alterations in the brain, but how they interact is not well understood. Conventional unimodal analyses are limited in their ability to characterize complex neuropsychiatric diseases because each modality provides an incomplete view of the brain. In contrast, we propose to use innovative fusion approaches that exploit the richness of multimodal data to discover covariations across multiple neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measures simultaneously. This proposal capitalizes on existing data from 3 completed NIDA-funded projects on the neurobehavioral effects of HIV and drug abuse. When combined, the dataset will consist of 217 unique cases (108 HIV+ and 109 HIV-) with in-depth substance use histories, multimodal brain images (i.e., structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI), comprehensive neurocognitive batteries, and a wide range of other phenotypic data. The central hypothesis is that HIV-specific co-alterations in gray matter volume and white matter integrity shape neural functioning and in turn NCI, and that cocaine use worsens these alterations due to its long-term effects on neural circuitry. Using complementary multimodal analyses (supervised fusion and connectomics), we aim to: (1) identify neural biomarkers of HIV neurological disease and associated NCI; and (2) test cocaine as a moderator of HIV-specific co-alterations in brain structure and function and associated NCI. In addition, the project will develop new, advanced methods to improve MRI data quality for cross-study harmonization and to optimize the prediction of NCI based on multimodal indices. This amalgamated dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to test new and clinically important hypotheses about the neural substrates of HIV- associated NCI in the context of drug abuse. The proposal responds directly to the need for research to ?characterize brain morphology or function that is aberrant as a consequence of chronic drug use? and ?[its role] in the evolving dynamics of HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, treatment, prevention, and service delivery? [PAR- 16-234]. This research also addresses high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including investigation of neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers of neuroHIV that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment monitoring in active drug users and serve as targets for clinical interventions to mitigate the burden caused by HIV-associated NCI."
"9543700","Immunotherapies targeting various protein aggregates such as amyloid-? (A?), tau and ?-synuclein are in different stages of clinical development, and collectively are the most common approach by the pharmaceutical industry to tackle diseases characterized by such depositions [13-15]. The majority of these approaches involve whole antibodies and much less attention has been paid to antibody fragments which have certain advantages and their therapeutic and diagnostic potential should be explored further. Specifically, single domain antibodies (sdAbs) are of particular interest because their small size (13 kDa) improves tissue penetration, including through the blood-brain-barrier, allowing better access over antibodies (150 kDa) to the target molecule and its hidden epitopes. Importantly as well, they are high affinity, and easy to engineer and grow in large quantities. The Specific Aim is to determine the therapeutic potential of camelid single-domain heavy chain antibody fragments (sdAbs) against the tau protein. It is hypothesized that their small size will provide therapeutic benefits over whole antibodies, primarily because of greater access to the target, and to some extent due to their binding to novel epitopes. We have generated 150 clones of sdAbs that recognize various forms of the tau protein and propose to determine their therapeutic potential in various models. For the initial screen, up to 40 of the individual sdAbs will be expressed globally in neurons of fruit fly models of tauopathy, and their ability to prevent/attenuate the tauopathy monitored. Subsequently, the 5 most efficacious sdAbs will be examined further in flies by expressing them in astrocytes or peripherally, and in cell culture models of tauopathy and the most efficacious one in an animal model. Our preliminary data supports the feasibility of screening for therapeutic efficacy of antibody fragments targeting the tau protein in fly models. Specifically, we show that neuronal expression of an anti-tau single chain variable antibody fragment (scFv) prevents developmental toxicity of overexpression of human tau with or without a tauopathy mutation, and significantly extends the life span of the tauopathy flies. The proposed studies may identify a novel class of therapy candidates for Alzheimer's disease, with direct relevance to various other protein misfolding disorders."
"9417940","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to discover novel genetic variants that regulate sensitivity to an addictive drug, cocaine. Discovery of novel genes and alleles that mediate addiction will lend itself to discovery of mechanistic components in addiction pathways that can be targeted for treatment and intervention. We have taken a forward genetic mutagenesis approach to discover variants that regulate acute response to cocaine, hyperactivity and anxiety, all predictors of addictive behavior. Mutagenesis based screening in model animals is completely unbiased and has been bedrock in biology for over 50 years. We have conducted one of the largest screens to date for cocaine response and open field behaviors. From this screen of over 17,000 mice we have a collection of ten mutants and have genetically mapped three of these mutants to large chromosomal intervals. Now, we propose to leverage next-generation sequencing technology to find the exact mutation responsible for the phenovariance in these mutants. We will also carry our RNA-Seq to understand the transcriptomic program that is perturbed in these mutants. We will carry out an integrated multistep next- generation sequencing approach utilizing exome, whole genome, and RNA sequencing to study these mutants. Successful completion of this project will lead to detection of viable causal variants for addiction liability and identification of the pathway perturbed by th variant. This project has significant potential for discovery of novel genes, alleles, and pathways that regulate cocaine responses. From this information we will be able to identify new neural substrates of addiction, discover novel molecular components and establish a better mechanistic understanding of cocaine response and its proximity to potential druggable targets. We will also provide the addiction research community with new mouse models for altered drug response."
"9598075","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kinase inhibitors created a new paradigm in chemotherapy and are a major focus of new oncology drug development, but developmental success rates are low (5-10%). Resistance to kinase inhibitors occurs through target-dependent mechanisms (e.g. point mutations that abrogate drug binding) and target-independent mechanisms (e.g. upregulation of alternative signaling pathways, termed kinome reprogramming). Therefore, combinations of inhibitors that target several kinases at once are desirable to have a better chance of avoiding the resistance/relapse cycle. Detecting protein kinase activity inside living cells (rather than in lysates or reconstituted systems) is important or understanding kinase inhibitor drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and would lead to better screening for inhibitors likely to make it through the development process. We will develop multiplexed, cell-based assays for specific kinase activities that are important to inhibitor response and kinome reprogramming, and use them to detect kinase activation profiles in patient cells and for inhibitor screens. Phosphorylation of the biosensors is detected using time-resolved lanthanide luminescence measurements, in which Tb3+ emission energy is measured directly via small molecule fluorophores to give different emission colors depending on the fluorophore. In Aim 1, we will establish quantitative assays for activity (and therefore inhibition) of key kinases in drug sensitive and drug resistant CML cells, profiling the pathway activation phenotypes in therapeutically relevant cellular states. We will use the set of biosensors we have already established in preliminary work, and add biosensors for other kinases as they are developed. The assays will be established with cell lines and samples from CML patients (comparing to healthy controls), and validated with RT-qPCR and SWATH proteomics. In Aim 2, we will screen for synergies between existing kinase inhibitor drugs and new compounds (via libraries). We will also develop homogenous multiplexed analysis of biosensor phosphorylation using energy transfer from lanthanides to organic dyes. In Aim 3, we expand the biosensor design pipeline to develop new, non-natural peptide substrates to use as biosensors for other kinases. The work described in this aim will add to the set of biosensors we already have available. Completion of the work described in this proposal will give us a novel assay for multiple kinases, a suite of new biosensors as well as new and refined detection strategies to use in screening. Drug discovery will benefit from this technology's ability to address kinome reprogramming mechanisms by targeting several kinases at a time. Drug development will benefit from companion assays for multiple targets that could follow a drug or drug combination through the hit to lead transition, target validation, pre-clinical studies, clinial trials, and beyond into treatment management. This assay and its associated tools will contribute to the next generation of targeted therapy development in cancer by breaking new ground in our ability to model the disease environment during drug screening and development."

Specifically, it is hypothesized that absence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the NADPH oxidase results in: i) deficient display of signals on activated and dying CGD neutrophils needed to facilitate their recognition and clearance (efferocytosis) by macrophages, ii) deficient macrophage PPAR?, a master controller of programming for efferocytosis and anti-inflammatory functions, and iii) deficient crosstalk to phagocyte mitochondria for the production of additional oxidants needed for optimal microbial killing. It is hypothesized that pioglitazone, a PPAR? agonist approved for use in type 2 diabetes mellitus, will provide key signals bypassing the mutated NADPH oxidase in phagocytes. Specifically, it is hypothesized that pioglitazone will exert these effects both by its activation of PPAR? and possibly by PPAR?-independent alteration of mitochondria bioenergetics. To this end, pioglitazone treatment of CGD mice restored CGD macrophage/monocyte efferocytic capability and anti-inflammatory functions and also enhanced signaling by neutrophils for engulfment by macrophages. Importantly, after pioglitazone treatment, CGD phagocytes also showed enhanced mitochondrial oxidant production and partially restored bacterial killing. Preliminary data showed ex vivo pioglitazone treatment of human CGD monocytes had similar effects, and enhanced phagocyte responses have been demonstrated following the treatment of 3 CGD patients with pioglitazone. Translation of these preclinical and preliminary observations into a short-term clinical trial of pioglitazone in human CGD is proposed. The specific aims of this trial will be to determine whether pioglitazone treatment of CGD patients will restore i) PPAR? signaling, efferocytosis and anti-inflammatory signaling in blood monocytes, ii) phagocyte mitochondrial ROS production for enhanced ROS-dependent killing of microbes, iii) signaling by CGD neutrophils for their enhanced clearance, and determine whether treatment will iv) reduce systemic markers of inflammation, Th17 lymphocytes, and colitic inflammation. In summary, a new hypothesis ties the functioning NADPH oxidase to PPAR? activation, phagocyte programming, and mitochondrial ROS production, and gives impetus to a novel approach using an ?on the shelf? therapeutic, pioglitazone, to ameliorate both exaggerated inflammation and immunodeficiency in CGD. Further, an improved understanding of signaling downstream of the NADPH oxidase to PPAR? and to mitochondrial oxidant production is likely to provide insights into other chronic inflammatory conditions and potentially a means of enhancing host defense in chronic/resistant bacterial infections."
"9505506","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Building on her rich clinical background in addiction treatment, Dr. Keren Bachi, the candidate, aspires to become a cross-disciplinary independent investigator in an area of critical importance within drug addiction: the neuro-immune biomarkers underlying adult social cognitive function (mentalizing; the ability to understand the mental states of others) as associated with exposure to early life stress. Drug addicted individuals frequently experience social stress (e.g., childhood maltreatment, poverty) which may shape neural and physiological responses to social interactions and exacerbate illness risk (e.g., craving, relapse). Training will center on neuro-immune-environment systems approach to drug addiction, with mentorship in neuroimaging of human addiction (primary mentor Dr. Goldstein), immune dysregulation in psychiatry (Dr. Gabbay), neuroinflammation (Dr. Russo), advanced biostatistics (Mr. Weinberg), immunologic assessment (Dr. Kim-Schulze), social cognition (Dr. Moeller), and mechanisms linking stress, immune adaptations, and effects on brain function in addictive behaviors (Dr. Sinha). Goals will be accomplished through didactic training primarily at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, conferences, and mainly by the study of: (I) characterizing the behavioral and neural correlates of deficits in mentalizing in cocaine addicted individuals vs. matched healthy controls, using a well-validated functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm that robustly activates the mentalizing network; (II) comparing inflammation between the two study groups, using an immune-blood-profile previously associated with cocaine use, but here examined for the first time vis-à-vis mentalizing and childhood maltreatment; and (III) discerning whether inflammation markers mediate the relationships between childhood trauma with altered neural engagement/behavior during the mentalizing task. While neuroimaging allows for spatially specific determination of brain activity, immune biomarkers enable detection of molecular and cellular-pathways, and their join study would facilitate identification of neuro- immune contributions to core deficits in addiction. Furthermore, testing for a contribution of biographic adversity-history may enable the grounding of the neural and physiological findings in identifiable (and potentially preventable) long-lasting effects of social-environmental stress. Future efforts could capitalize on the putative mediating effects of inflammation, to develop novel treatments in drug addiction incorporating immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory drugs, which notably have been shown to enhance cognition in other psychiatric patients. Enhancement of social cognition (mentalizing) could augment treatment success and prevent relapse in addiction. Finally, social stress management interventions and prevention efforts could potentially most optimally be deployed in those with severe childhood maltreatment. The experience, and data gained from this study will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to build this line of research and develop novel treatments in drug addiction."
"9491602","Project Summary A major goal of biologists is to ?see? inside cells to discover where and when each individual protein acts. Conventional light microscopy approaches limit our spatial resolution to ~250 nm, which in several instances is only slightly smaller than the organism itself. This classic physical limitation has been broken through the development of Super-Resolution microscopy. Our proposal is to acquire a new DeltaVision OMX-SR imaging system to replace an aging/ailing system, which is a flagship piece of equipment at the IU Light Microscopy Imaging Center. The OMX 3D-Structured Illumination Microscope (SIM) has enabled our users to make breakthrough discoveries by achieving sub-diffraction subcellular resolution to address a number of important biological problems. This has been most notable in the area of microbial cell biology in which the small size of the organism precludes subcellular resolution using conventional widefield or confocal technologies. The power of the OMX system is that the super resolution is achieved with conventional lasers and computer technology, the microscope system is a standard high-end widefield microscope, conventional fluorophores can be used obviating the need to develop new reagents, up to 4 color labeling can be achieved by the use of multiple laser lines, and the system can be maintained and operated by an experienced cell biologist. Practically speaking, these features are what have allowed our users to implement this technology to answer a wide array of cell biological questions and have led to a number of significant new discoveries by the user group. Our current system is no longer serviceable due to a lack of replacement parts, and there has been an escalation in the amount of down-time of the current instrument, impacting the work of our NIH-funded user group. After assessing a number of competing technologies and instruments, the DeltaVision OMX-SR emerges as a clear leader of the 3D-SIM field due to its sensitivity, its resolution, its speed of data acquisition, its robustness in maintaining alignment, and in the potential for users to carry out live SIM with suitable temporal resolution."
"9443408","Project Summary/Abstract In this proposal we address a very substantial limitation in the ability of existing technologies to provide critical proteomic information from normal and cancer tissues. In standard proteomic analyses, proteins in complex protein mixtures such as total cell lysate are digested with proteases such as trypsin to produce peptides. These peptides are then analyzed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the proteins present are identified by the presence of peptides contained within them. Relative or absolute quantification may be obtained if desired by a variety of different isotopic tagging strategies. While this strategy, termed ?bottom-up? proteomics, works well for identifying large numbers of proteins present in complex samples, it suffers from the loss of contextual information about the particular form of the proteins from which the peptides are derived, the ?proteoforms?. In order to understand the processes and pathways that are operative in cancer, it is essential to know the identities and abundances of these ?proteoforms? present in the tissues. Recently, a new approach has been developed for the identification and quantification of proteoforms in complex mixtures. In this approach two pieces of information are obtained for each proteoform in the sample: a highly accurate measurement of the proteoform intact mass, and the number of lysine residues it contains. This information allows identification and quantification of thousands of proteoforms. However, at present it can only be performed on cells grown in culture containing isotopically labeled lysine amino acids. This limitation makes it impossible to use the strategy for identification of proteoforms in cancer tissue samples. It is proposed here to develop an alternative means of introducing the isotopic tags needed for proteoform quantification and for the determination of the number of a targeted amino acid residue in each proteoform. Cysteine amino acids have been chosen in place of lysine amino acids because of their amenability to highly efficient tagging reactions, and suitable isotopic labels have been designed and will be synthesized and tested. This new chemistry will provide the power of the isotopic tagging strategy for proteomic analyses of cancer tissue samples. Such proteoform level knowledge of changes that occur in cancer will reveal a new universe of possible cancer biomarkers, as well as opening a currently closed avenue to understanding the proteomic changes that occur in cancer."
"9515482","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced age is associated with an increase in likelihood of having presbycusis, a hearing impairment treated primarily through the use of hearing aids (HA) and aural rehabilitation. With twenty percent of the population predicted to be 65 years or older by 2030, hearing loss is a public health concern. A significant problem is that the prevalence of HA use among people with hearing loss is low, and untreated hearing loss contributes to a reduced quality of life, avoidance of social situations, and feelings of loneliness. The most common shortcoming of HA is poor performance in noisy environments, but traditional standard-of-care audiometry does a poor job explaining why this occurs. Many factors beyond the audiogram have been suggested as possible explanations for poor speech understanding in noise; however, none have explained a substantial portion of the variance in outcomes until recently. Both hearing loss and age cause declines in the ability to use fine temporal and spectral cues. Recent evidence suggests that sensitivity to joint spectro-temporal modulations (STM; i.e., spectral patterns that change over time, as occur in natural speech sounds) explains a significant portion of the variance in speech understanding in noise, after controlling for audibility. Notably, STM is also predictive of self-reported outcomes. Individual differences in STM sensitivity, combined with the known effects that HA processing has on distorting spectro-temporal cues, mean that some HA users may be set up for failure. It is hypothesized that successful HA use partially depends on a person?s ability to process spectro-temporal signals and the integrity of the cues (distorted by HA processing) delivered to the listener?s auditory system. The long-term goal is to optimize a novel evidence-based, HA-fitting intervention, by building on a strong set of preliminary data showing that sensitivity to STM is a robust predictor of speech understanding in noise and self-reported outcomes for HA users. The first aim is to comprehensively describe the nature of the interaction between HA distortion and STM sensitivity and subsequent effects on aided outcomes using an observational approach. Under this aim, validation of suspected underlying mechanisms responsible for STM sensitivity will also be examined. The second aim is to determine the extent to which altering spectro-temporal cues, through HA manipulation, affects speech in noise performance, using a randomized, cross-sectional design. Other patient-centered variables will be assessed, such as working memory, age, and audibility, which may be responsible for remaining variability in outcomes. This work translates basic hearing science principles into clinical applications, and will have implications for individualizing existing clinical treatments."
"9543170","ABSTRACT Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common single cause of end stage kidney disease in the USA. Disruption of physiological insulin signaling occurs in glomeruli and podocytes in DKD, and podocyte-specific deficiency of insulin receptor (IR) recapitulates many features of DKD. Two isoforms of the IR have been described that either lack (IRA) or contain (IRB) the 12 amino acids encoded by exon 11. IRA signals primarily through p70S6K while IRB signals primarily through Akt, an important survival factor in podocytes. The cause of altered insulin signaling observed in podocytes in DKD as well as the relative contribution of IRA and IRB signaling to podocyte function remains to be established. Podocytes are dependent on functional lipid rafts for proper signaling and survival, and lipid rafts affect primarily IRB signaling. Although the raft-associated protein caveolin-1 (cav-1) binds IR and modulates IR-dependent signaling, little is known about how lipid rafts influence IR specific isoform signaling. We have identified sphingomyelin-phosphodiesterase-acid-like-3b (SMPDL3b) as a novel enzyme expressed in podocyte lipid rafts and upregulated in DKD. Our preliminary data show that SMPDL3b differentially affects IRA/IRB signaling by disrupting the interaction of IRB with Cav1 and facilitating IRA binding to Cav1. The SMPDL3b protein contains a phosphodiesterase-like domain that allows SMPDL3b to form complexes with Cav1 and a phosphatase-like domain that converts ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) to ceramide. However, the mechanisms linking SMPDL3b overexpression to podocyte altered IR signaling in DKD remain unknown. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that SMPDL3b suppresses IRB/Cav1 interaction by converting C1P to ceramide, and that podocyte-specific SMPDL3b deletion or C1P replacement are sufficient to prevent podocyte injury in DKD. We will determine in Aim 1 if SMPDL3b differentially affects IRA/IRB localization and function in podocyte lipid rafts. Aim 2 will investigate if SMPDL3b deficiency protects from podocyte injury in experimental mouse models of DKD and in Aim 3, we will explore if C1P replacement is sufficient to restore IR signaling and to protect from DKD. This proposal is significant, as it will help our understanding of the mechanisms by which sphingolipids may regulate insulin receptor (IR) signaling in podocytes as well as other cell types. This proposal is innovative as it may support the development of a C1P lipid replacement strategy for the cure of patients affected by DKD. !"

"9495782","Project Summary/Abstract: Myelinating cells, oligodendrocytes (OLs) in the CNS and Schwann cells (SCs) in the PNS, produce a vast amount of myelin sheath. Actively myelinating OLs and SCs must produce enormous amounts of myelin proteins to assemble myelin sheath during development. Mature OLs and SCs in adults need to produce a substantial amount of myelin proteins to maintain myelin structure homeostasis. Myelin proteins are synthesized, modified, and folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Maintaining ER protein homeostasis is essential and necessary for the function of myelinating cells. Currently available data indicate that actively myelinating OLs and SCs are more sensitive to disruption of ER protein homeostasis than mature OLs and SCs, due to the rate of myelin protein production. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which myelinating cells maintain ER protein homeostasis remain unexplored. Misfolded/unfolded proteins in the ER are detected and degraded by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In response to ER stress, activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which comprises three parallel signaling pathways PERK, IRE1, and ATF6?, restores ER protein homeostasis by facilitating protein folding, attenuating protein translation, and enhancing ERAD. Deletion of either PERK or ATF6? does not affect myelinating cells under normal conditions. Surprisingly, our preliminary results showed that double deletion of PERK and ATF6? in myelinating cells led to late-onset dysmyelination in the CNS of adult mice. Both PERK activation and ATF6? activation stimulates the expression of genes related to the Sel1L-Hrd1 complex, the best-characterized ERAD machinery. Intriguingly, our preliminary observation showed that Sel1L inactivation specifically in myelinating cells led to adult-onset dysmyelination in mice. Data indicate that overexpression of PLP, the most abundant myelin protein in the CNS and a substrate of ERAD, leads to soma retention of PLP in OLs, resulting in adult-onset dysmyelination in the CNS. Importantly, our preliminary data showed that both Sel1L inactivation and inactivation of PERK and ATF6? induced soma retention of PLP in OLs. Thus, in this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the UPR is required for maintaining ER protein homeostasis and the viability and function of mature OLs in adults by regulating ERAD of PLP. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate that inactivation of PERK and ATF6? impairs the viability and function of mature OLs in adult mice. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate that Sel1L inactivation impairs the viability and function of mature OLs and SCs in adult mice. In Aim 3, we will determine if Sel1L inactivation compromises the viability and function of mature OLs through impairment of ERAD of PLP and subsequent soma retention of PLP. This work will uncover a mechanism responsible for maintaining ER protein homeostasis in mature OLs. The knowledge gained from these studies will advance our understanding of the biology of myelinating cells."

"9601939","Project Summary Learned associations between environmental contexts and experience are the basis of decision-making and allow organisms to guide behavior towards advantageous outcomes. Dysfunction in the neuronal processes that regulate these associations, especially in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), is a critical factor in the pathology of addiction. The NAc is a heterogeneous region primarily composed of two opposing cell types: D1 and D2 medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs). Optogenetic stimulation of these cells results in divergent behavioral outputs; thus, it is important to study these populations in isolation to understand the cell-type specific signals that underlie NAc-mediated learning processes. Under the primary mentorship of Dr. Eric Nestler and Dr. Paul Kenny at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, the Pathway to Independence Award will provide the opportunity to build on my expertise in cocaine self-administration and synaptic function while simultaneously developing my training and expertise in in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetics. In the mentored K-phase of this grant fiber photometry calcium imaging will be paired with cocaine self-administration in transgenic mouse lines that express Cre-recombinase in D1 or D2 MSN populations. These mice allow for cell-type specific expression of molecular targets, such as calcium indicators (GCaMP6f) and opsins (ChR2; NpHR). By expressing GCaMP6f in D1 or D2 MSNs, the temporally specific signals that mediate cue-induced cocaine seeking will be determined. Further, optogenetic stimulation and inhibition will allow for direct manipulation of these cells and the associated seeking behavior. The innovative combination of these tools will enable the mapping of how D1 and D2 MSNs encode cue information and concurrently establish causality. In the independent phase (R00), these cutting-edge techniques will be combined with the inducible ArcCreERT2 mice which express constructs (GCaMP6f/Opsins) selectively in cells that are activated by environmental stimuli during a temporally specific window. This will allow for the recording and manipulation of neuronal ensembles that are activated by cocaine or cocaine-paired cues to determine their role in drug seeking. Together, these data will elucidate the underlying neural processes that control associative learning and how cocaine exposure dysregulates MSN signaling to drive relapse following abstinence, which will expand our basic understanding of addiction and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic avenues. In summary, the research proposed in this Pathway to Independence Award will elucidate the neural mechanisms involved in addiction while simultaneously preparing me to develop a fully independent research program capable of integrating a wide range of circuit based and behavioral approaches to dissect the neurobiology of addiction. ."
"9633883","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This is a renewal R01 application to characterize an array of novel knockin (KI) mouse lines, we have created using a previously-described gene-targeting approach, to express unmutated precursors of four well- characterized, representative HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) lineages. Developing a preventative vaccine remains a critical priority to end the HIV pandemic, and it is widely held that such a vaccine will need to induce bnAb responses. While the eventual elicitation of bnAb responses in some HIV-1+ patients shows such responses are possible, no vaccine yet can elicit them. In this regard, animal models that can systematically identify impediments in bnAb precursor activation and maturation and iteratively test novel strategies to overcome such hurdles, would be highly beneficial for developing a bnAb-based vaccine. Three key roadblocks that merit further testing in such models are: i) B-cell tolerance controls, which can delete, inactivate, or modify bnAb lineage-expressing B-cells, before and during immunization, ii) high somatic mutation levels that accumulate in bnAbs over prolonged periods of infection, amounts prohibitive for vaccines to elicit, and whose exact level required for function is not known, and iii) no or minimal bnAb precursor affinity for standard Env immunogens. The overall objective of this proposal is to use novel bnAb precursor-directed immunogens to define minimal requirements to activate, and then induce breadth in, naïve precursor KI B-cells from CH103, CH31, CH01, and CH58 lineages (and determine if/what host controls limit both processes). The matured Abs of these lineages are all relatively less mutated, making them more attractive vaccine candidates. Furthermore, they target distinct Env regions, and express a different set of functional traits/neutralization profiles, thus embody the bnAb spectrum. We hypothesize that this unique set of immunogens and models will allow us to learn how to induce individual, immunization-directed bnAb pathways with moderate breadth, manageable mutation levels and no (or only cryptic) self-reactivity. To test this central hypothesis, we will use a multilayered approach where in Aim 1, we will first define to what extent naïve KI B-cells expressing CH103, CH31, CH01, or CH58 lineage precursors are under host controls. Then, in Aim 2, we will learn how best to activate these lineages with precursor-targeting immunogens, so they can be recruited into maturation pathways. Finally, in Aim 3, using immunogens that can initiate maturation, we will define minimal evolutionary trajectories to desired bnAb responses, under conditions where affinity maturation will be enhanced via cross-breeding KI mice to those overexpressing polymerase-? (with elevated Ig somatic mutation rates) and/or Eµ-bcl2 (having increased B-cell survival). Learning how to induce, and what limits bnAbs in these model settings will help define more tractable vaccine targets and strategies to elicit in clinical trials. More generally, the host-HIV interaction issues addressed here (poor precursor binding, self-reactivity/mimicry, and excess mutation) may be informative for viral infections like hepatitis C or influenza, also requiring bnAb responses and problematic as vaccine targets."
"9668979","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States alone, seasonal (inter pandemic) influenza is responsible for more than 200,000 hospitalizations and more than 23,000 deaths per year. The primary strategy to attenuate the impact of influenza epidemics is vaccination. Currently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged 6 months or older. However, some of these recommendations have been questioned, and the paucity of vaccine effectiveness estimates based on laboratory confirmed influenza disease further fuels this controversy. Furthermore, because influenza viruses and vaccines change annually, and because recommendations for these vaccines now cover most of the US population, annual assessments of vaccine effectiveness are needed to assess whether influenza vaccination is having its intended effects. Vanderbilt investigators have conducted prospective population- based surveillance for laboratory confirmed influenza for both the NIH and the CDC. We propose to conduct prospective surveillance in Davidson County, TN, with the following specific aims: 1) To conduct active population-based surveillance in adults hospitalized for laboratory confirmed influenza, to determine age-specific rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations; and, 2) To determine influenza vaccine effectiveness annually, using a case-control study design, among influenza positive adults hospitalized for influenza and influenza negative hospitalized controls. Vanderbilt investigators are experienced in conducting active prospective population-based hospital surveillance of laboratory confirmed influenza infections and in assessments of the effectiveness of influenza vaccines."
"9617314","Project Summary/Abstract Identifying genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation is a major challenge in population genetics. Particularly in humans, the task of confidently detecting the action of recent adaptive natural selection (or positive selection) has proved troublesome. Indeed there is considerable controversy over whether recent positive selection has a substantial impact on human genetic variation. The work proposed here will address this problem by creating a more complete map of positive selection across many human populations, identifying selection on de novo mutations as well as selection on previously standing variation.  Specifically, the proposed research seeks to construct a scan for positives election that is more robust and accurate than any currently existing methods (Aim 1). This tool will utilize supervised machine learning techniques allowing it combine information from a number of existing tests for natural selection, and will be tested extensively on a large suite of population genetic simulations presenting a wide range of potentially confounding scenarios. This tool will then be released to the public. Next, it will be applied to 26 human populations in which a large sample of genomes have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Aim 2), revealing similarities and differences in the tempo, mode, and targets of adaptive evolution across human populations. Finally, because selection on both beneficial and deleterious mutations skews genetic variation, our method will be used to identify regions of the genome least affected by natural selection, which will in turn be used to produce more accurate inferences of human demographic histories (Aim 3).  The mentored phase of this work will be performed within the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University. This is an intellectually stimulating environment with numerous journal clubs, an excellent seminar series, and several other research groups using computational techniques. The project will be performed under the stewardship of Dr. Andrew Kern, from whom the candidate will also receive training in machine learning and population genetics. Dr. Schrider will also receive training in population genetics and guidance from Dr. Jody Hey (Co-mentor) at nearby Temple University. This training will help Dr. Schrider acquire skills that will aid not only in the completion of the proposed work but also his transition to principle investigator of an internationally recognized independent research program studying the evolutionary forces driving patterns of human genetic variation."
"9573868","The NanoString nCounter Flex Analysis System is manufactured by NanoString Technologies, Inc. (Seattle, WA), who were the original developers of this technology and remain the sole manufacturer and provider of the technology. The MVAHCS currently does not have this equipment. MVAHCS has a long tradition of translational research, a notable example being the adoption of the Gleason grading system for prostate cancer developed at this institution. However, in the present era it is critical that clinicians and basic scientists have at their disposal cutting-edge, state of the art instrumentation to rapidly acquire reliable data for investigations with potential of leading to clinical translation. The Nanostring is designed to provide direct digital counting of signals such as RNA, miRNA, DNA copy number, ChIP DNA, and protein ? all from the same sample which can be as small as nanogram quantity. Samples for analysis can be serum, plasma, FFPE tissue, fresh or frozen tissue, cells, and exosomes. Expression of various signals is analyzed in a cartridge-based DNA/RNA/Protein expression analyzer. Combined sample analysis for sequential testing eliminates bias inherent in splitting samples and using different analysis methods, allowing direct correlation between signals in a given sample. Data are available within 24 h. The platform can be used for pre- designed human, mouse and rat work or for custom work on various targets or species of interest (up to 770 genes in the same sample). NanoString Technologies staff provide custom design services at no cost to analyze desired signals; the only cost is for the purchase of the preformatted arrays or cartridges containing the capture and reporter probes which together provide a unique molecular barcode. The machine requires only minimal training (about 30 min). The system runs the same exact chemistries as the FDA approved tests and thus provides a platform for rapid transition of pre-clinical and clinical investigations to the clinical arena. No bioinformatics are required to access data, so that the statistical support available at MVAHCS is sufficient for retrospective and prospective patient and animal studies. The technology has strong potential of application in a range of studies including Gulf war illness, lung disease, neuropathology, infectious disease, inflammation, immune-oncology, autoimmune disease, obesity and various cancers. The technology has the most advanced capability of identifying potential biomarkers for disease identification, progression, and therapy decisions, such as miRNA, mRNA, and protein signatures from serum of prostate cancer and HNSCC patients, to identify their correlation between tissue signatures and disease status in retrospective and eventually prospective studies. These data may enable us to predict disease progression and response to therapy, and yield information of value for the clinical management of the disease in the patients (i.e., personalized medicine). If funded, the instrument will be housed within a dedicated imaging room in the MVAHCS. Dr. Ahmed will work with the MVAHCS Research Office to oversee the training and usage of the equipment under the full support of MVAHCS Director and the R&D Committee Chair. The identified major and minor users collectively represent numerous VA research disciplines from both basic and translational research (neuroscience, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular research, liver and pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, stem cell therapies, obesity, and Gulf War Illness). At least 75% of the instrument capacity will be used by VA funded researchers and about 25% will be occupied by minor users. In order to maintain the status of the MVAHCS as one of the largest and most active research programs, it is critical that cutting edge technology be available to our researchers. The addition of the NanoString nCounter analysis system would facilitate research to address the specific needs of US Veterans. Further, this would foster multidisciplinary collaborations between MVAHCS colleagues and promote collaborative, benchtop to clinic translational science that would benefit all Americans."
"9454331","PROJECT SUMMARY Although esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a relatively uncommon cancer, the incidence of this disease has increased rapidly in recent decades; moreover, at the time of detection of EA, most patients have very poor prognosis. The alarming increase in EA over the past several decades, along with the poor prognosis for those affected, demand investigation into the risk factors for this disease, improved management of patients at risk, and development of preventive measures. Advances in these areas will have significant public health benefit in terms of reducing morbidity and mortality for those affected, as well as reducing the public health costs associated with managing EA at advanced stages. To better manage patients at risk for EA will require an improved understanding of the mechanisms of neoplastic progression in the esophagus. Such progression involves the development of Barrett's esophagus, a premalignant lesion in which the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium, visible as an abnormality on endoscopy, and confirmed on biopsy as specialized columnar epithelium with intestinal metaplasia. For these reasons, the NCI has developed the Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet), a consortium research initiative with the goal of reducing the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of EAC, through answering key questions related to the progression of this disease, especially in the premalignant stage of BE, the only precursor lesion definitively associated with EA. In this application we describe the accomplishments to date, as well as the vision forward, for the BETRNet Coordinating Center (BETRNet-CC), with the following critical functions: ? Administrative and logistical support for the BETRNet program, including efficient communications and  coordination of efforts to connect available resources, serve as a data management center, and integrate  activities of the research centers; ? Coordination of cross-network research through leadership and management of diverse teams, as well as  providing logistical and administrative support to the governing body of the BETRNet (the Steering  Committee); and ?

This Core had supported more than 50 VA, NIH, and DoD-funded projects in endocrinology, orthopedics surgery, neurobiology, immunology, and cardiothoracic surgery, and enabled numerous new collaborations in basic and translational research within the greater UCSF research community. The proposed acquisition of this state-of-the-art AFM system, which is optimized to facilitate analysis of biological specimens and outcomes, is aimed to further expand our Core capacity. This tool will allow investigators accessing this Core to investigate the physical features of tissues, cells, biomaterials, and molecules at the micron to nanometer scale. Given the critical role of the physical microenvironment in biological processes throughout development and disease, this equipment would allow our investigators to pursue an important unexplored area of research that could not be achieved by the current instrumentation in the Core. This new instrumentation is anticipated in the short term to greatly expand the research scope of 7 active VA-funded projects and more than 15 NIH and DoD projects awarded to the participating investigators."
"9442730","PROJECT SUMMARY (CORE A)   Use of combusted tobacco continues to devastate public health. The Food and Drug Administration now has  the authority to reduce the nicotine content of combusted tobacco products, potentially rendering cigarettes and  other harmful products less addictive. This renewal application proposes three innovative projects that extend  our work towards understanding the impact of reducing the nicotine content of combusted tobacco in the context  of alternative nicotine and tobacco products. The Administrative Core focuses on addressing the challenges of  conducting the proposed science and enabling the investigative team to take full advantage of the opportunity  to make significant contributions to the field of tobacco regulatory science. Specifically, this includes the following  aims: 1) To provide an infrastructure that facilitates integration across the projects and cores and the  implementation of methods, measures and procedures that yield high quality research. 2) To facilitate  communication and dissemination of information to scientists, policy makers, other stakeholders, and the  community at large. 3) To provide and monitor a training plan for NIH-supported pre-doctoral and post-doctoral  researchers interested in tobacco regulatory research. 4) To generate new science through a pilot projects  program that addresses innovative research questions related to the aims of CENIC, contributes to investigator  training, and fosters collaborations among investigators. The Administrative Core will be housed at the University  of Pittsburgh under the leadership of Drs. Eric Donny and Dorothy Hatsukami (Co-Directors). Each of the four  functions will be overseen by a core member of our team. An External Advisory Board will provide annual input  on the overall direction of the Center, areas that need to be addressed, and progress being made. A single Data  Safety and Monitoring Board will oversee all three projects."
"9440457","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder and the leading known genetic cause of autism in girls. Mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) account for the vast majority of RTT cases. The neurobiology of MECP2 is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of RTT and identifying therapeutics for the disorder. MeCP2 is an epigenetic modulator of gene expression that has recently been shown to interact significantly with microRNA machinery; these interactions are at the core of MeCP2 mechanisms. Multiple lines of evidence point to a role for MeCP2 in successive stages of brain development, including prenatal neurogenesis, postnatal development of connections and function, and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. We hypothesize that the pleiotropic effects of MeCP2 are mediated in prenatal development via a set of early regulated miRNAs that influence neurogenesis; during postnatal development through a different set of miRNAs that regulate Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling; and in late development into adulthood via a third set of miRNAs that influence synaptic function and plasticity. The goal of this proposal is to employ cutting-edge miRNA methodologies, in combination with stem cell, behavioral, two-photon imaging, and targeted electrophysiological approaches, to reveal the function of MeCP2-related miRNAs at different developmental stages. In aim 1, we will examine the role of MeCP2 and downstream miRNA-mediated pathways in prenatal neurogenesis, using isogenic human RTT model cell lines (aim 1a), 3-D cerebral organoids (aim 1b), and mouse models (aim 1c). Our findings to date implicate miR-199 and -214 in the aberrant regulation of prenatal neurogenesis as a result of MeCP2 deficiency; we will analyze the functional mechanisms and molecular pathways downstream of these miRNAs. In aim 2, we will determine the influence of postnatal MeCP2-regulated miRNAs on IGF1 signaling, and their potential role in RTT therapeutics. We will examine the regulation of LIN28a and the let-7 family of miRNAs downstream of BDNF, and their ability to regulate IGF1 expression, in Mecp2 deficient mice (aim 2a). We will investigate whether normalizing the levels of molecular alterations using the ß2 adrenergic receptor agonist clenbuterol can positively impact survival and a range of phenotypes in Mecp2 deficient mice (aim 2b), along with synergistic interactions between clenbuterol and IGF1 as a potent mechanism-based combination therapeutic for RTT (aim 2c). In aim 3, we will examine the role of MeCP2 and late-expressed miRNAs such as miR-132 in regulating experience-dependent cortical plasticity. We will determine whether restoring expression of miR-132 in the visual cortex of Mecp2 mutant mice can restore normal age-dependent maturation of ocular dominance plasticity (aim 3a). We will also examine whether IGF1 (and subsequently, clenbuterol and the combination of clenbuterol and IGF1) upregulates miR-132 expression, and can act through its downstream mechanisms to influence plasticity (aim 3b)."
"9455466","SUMMARY Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating neurological disease affecting almost 2.5 million individuals worldwide. It is known that environmental factors heavily contribute to the etiology of MS, however their roles in disease course are not well understood. One interest in the field is whether or not dietary choices have an impact on disease severity in MS patients. Epidemiological studies have indicated high Body Mass Index (BMI) (?25) as a risk factor for earlier onset of MS, suggesting that high fat diet, which is associated with high BMI, may also be involved, however, their effects on progression of disease severity have not been explored. My proposal investigates the mechanisms linking high BMI and high fat diet to disease course using animal models of MS to test hypotheses generated from preliminary studies in human patients. In collaboration with the MS center at Mt. Sinai, I have analyzed data on brain volume, immune profile and diet in therapy-naïve RRMS patients which has revealed several differences between patients with a low BMI (<25) and those with a high BMI (?25), including greater monocytic counts in patients with a high BMI. We have further identified a potential mechanism underlying these differences, specifically, lipid-dependent modulation of DNA methylation in monocytes. Based on these results, my proposal tests the hypothesis that high fat diet leads to an accumulation of plasma ceramides that modify the methylome of genes affecting proliferation and function of monocytes, thereby leading to greater monocytic infiltration, greater CNS damage and more severe disease course using in vitro and in vivo models. The results of this proposal will have a high translational impact by providing essential information on the impact of diet on disease course that can be directly applied to patients."
"9575701","We are requesting funds through the Shared Equipment Evaluation Program (ShEEP) under the Research Equipment Management program offered by the Office of Research and Development for purchase of an EchoMRI 4in1 Body Composition Analyzer (EchoMRI LLC, Houston TX, USA) as an upgraded replacement for an older version that will be moving to a new institution in 2018. The new system allows for the measurement of body composition, specifically fat mass, lean mass, free water, and total body water, in live mice- and rat-sized animals. In addition, the EchoMRI 4in1 analyzer is also able to measure the composition of tissue samples / organs and biopsies (small tissue samples), which is not a feature of our current, outdated system. By using minimal restraint in live animals, experimenters are able to conduct long-term, longitudinal studies, without causing undue stress. Compared to other systems that require immobility for the measurement of body composition, typically through the use of anesthetics, this system can measure body composition in unrestrained animals by limiting their mobility within the specialized specimen tube. This equipment will be housed within the Minneapolis VAHCS Research Services Veterinary Medical Unit, and unlike other systems, does not require special shielding. This equipment will allow for the study of organ and tissue composition, as it related to cancer, obesity, and various other disease progressions. In addition, the quick measurement times for specimens (< 3min), make it possible to complete control and test paradigms more quickly, thereby reducing variability between control and test groups. This in turn will allow greater throughput of all users? experimental designs, increasing the productivity of the Minneapolis VAHCS investigators. The use of this equipment will compliment an existing inventory of multiuser based instruments with the end goal of increasing the efficiency of and supporting translational VA research. Dr. Patricia Bunney will oversee the administration and usage of the equipment under the full support of Minneapolis VAHCS Director, Mr. Patrick J. Kelly and the Research & Development Committee Chair, Dr. Ronald Bach. The major and minor user groups for this equipment span multiple VA research disciplines and represents both basic and translational research in areas such as: aging, addiction, cancer, neuroscience, stem cell therapies and obesity. The VA funded users combined will use at least 75% of the instrument capacity. The minor users group will occupy 25% of instrument capacity. The ability for Minneapolis VAHCS to continue to remain one of the largest and most active research programs in the VAHCS depends on the ability of its investigators to gain access to the newest generation of high-sensitivity, high-resolution instruments. The acquisition of the EchoMRI 4in1 Body Composition Analyzer would accelerate and enhance the rate at which researchers from multiple disciplines could acquire, analyze, and understand data with the long-term goal of benefiting the unique health care needs of US Veterans. This not only benefits the progress of VAHCS research in general but it would benefit the health care of all Americans."
"9442672","ABSTRACT  Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common form of adult-onset dementia and the number of patients with AD escalates dramatically each year. AD patients display hippocampal atrophy, memory impairment, and other cognitive and olfactory deficits. On the other hand, new neurons are generated throughout adulthood in two regions of the brain, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the sub- ventricular zone of the olfactory bulb and are incorporated into hippocampal network circuitry. In adults, the annual turnover of stem cells into neurons is 1.75% with a modest decline during aging. By contrast, the estimated annualized hippocampal atrophy rate is 1.41% per year for cognitively normal older people and 4.66% for patients with AD pathology. Disruption of this process has been postulated to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis in AD could either provide protection by proliferation of neural progenitor cells or cause accelerated neural degeneration due to impairment of neuronal network and synaptic plasticity. Many of the molecular players in AD are also modulators of adult neurogenesis, but genetic mechanism underlying adult neurogenesis in AD is still unclear. Recently, we discussed potential modulators of adult neurogenesis and their roles in neurodegenerative diseases in a review paper. The overall goal of the proposed project is to identify candidate genes and pathways which play a role in neurogenesis in adult brain and to test our hypothesis that 1) the neurogenesis pathway is significantly associated with hippocampal volume and 2) hippocampal neurogenesis-related genes and pathways are significantly perturbed in AD. We will use a large-scale imaging genetics meta-analysis summary and multimodal neuroimaging (MRI, PET) and genome-wide genotyping data from several independent cohorts. The specific Aims: (1) identify candidate genes associated with hippocampal neurogenesis using a pathway-based systems biology approach from publicly available databases and literature mining; (2) perform genome-wide gene-set enrichment analysis for hippocampal volume using a large-scale neuroimaging genetics meta-analysis (N~15,000); and (3) perform a neurogenesis-related targeted gene-based and pathway-based association analysis using AD-related biomarker endophenotypes. The proposed project will enable discovery of new genetic contributions to hippocampal neurogenesis and has strong translational potential to identify novel therapeutic targets related to learning and memory and AD neuroprotection. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH AD is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The fight against AD has increasingly become a top national priority. Identifying neurogenesis-related genes associated with AD provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of AD and helps to identify new therapeutic strategies."
"9458582","Project Summary The ability to record electrical activity from individual neurons has transformed our understanding of the nervous system1?3. Yet, it remains challenging to conclusively relate the activity of a neuron to specific features of visual perception. The goal of relating neuronal activity to perception has been hampered, in part, by an inability to measure visual function at a cellular-resolution in humans. Recently, the laboratory of Prof. Austin Roorda has developed techniques to deliver targeted spots of light small enough to stimulate individual cones in humans4,5. The ability to probe individual sensory neurons complements single-cone stimulation studies concerned with unraveling the cone contributions to visual receptive fields in lateral geniculate nucleus6 and in excised retina7 of monkey.  The proposed studies will first characterize the spectral properties of a mosaic of cones using densitometry and adaptive optics. Cone-sized spots of light will then be delivered to individual cones within the classified mosaic in order to relate their spectral properties directly to visual perception in human volunteers. The results of these studies will be used to constrain the development of a population model of retinal circuitry. This work will advance our basic understanding of the neural basis of visual perception and provide valuable information for designing future therapies to rescue function in the diseased retina. Together, these experiments offer an unprecedented opportunity to link cellular physiology, anatomy and visual perception in humans and primates. Briefly, the specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Resolve the contribution and extent of retinal lateral inhibition in color vision. This aim will precisely measure the influence of lateral interactions in the appearance of color and clarify the retinal contribution to these computations. Specific aim 2. Determine how the brain combines information from individual cones. This aim will answer how accurately predictions made from single cone studies will generalize to larger stimuli. Together these two aims will clarify how color and form are represented at the most elementary level in the visual system. The results will limit the possible circuits involved in computing color information and, subsequently, inform models of retinal processing that will be immediately translatable to researcher?s designing therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring normal visual perception in the damaged retina and to tools aimed at early detection of retinal disease."
"9510684","Polymeric drug delivery systems (DDSs) can change the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic drugs, focusing their action on the tumor site. For DDSs made out of block copolymers these features are directly influenced by the structure of the two interfaces present in the block copolymers: the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interface and the interface between the chemically stable and the biodegradable polymeric blocks. The two interfaces coincide in conventional PEG-based amphiphilic diblock copolymers, which make them susceptible to hydrolysis and premature degradation by amphiphilic esterases, resulting in a dramatic decrease of their circulation time in vivo. Our long-term goal is to enhance the shelf stability, in vivo dynamic selective stability and circulation time, drug protection and to control drug loading and drug release profile of polymeric DDSs via interfacial engineering of the PEG-based amphiphilic copolymers. The overall objective of this proposal is to test the above-mentioned properties of a set of PEG-PBO-PCL block copolymers with tuned interfaces via insertion of a hydrolytically stable hydrophobic PBO linker in between the PEG and PCL blocks. Our central hypothesis is that the PBO block separates the two interfaces, limits access of hydrolytic enzymes to the biodegradable hydrophobic core of the DDS, enhances drug loading and release profiles of the carrier and provides selective stability against esterases in blood/tumor. The rationale is that knowledge on how separation of the two interfaces affects the main features of these DDSs will allow generation of polymeric DDSs with pre-programmed stability, loading and release parameters. The specific aims of this project are: Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the impact of interfacial engineering via a hydrolytically stable hydrophobic PBO linker of various lengths on the physicochemical properties, shelf life and hydrolytic stability of polymeric nanoparticles against esterases present in blood and in tumors (selective stability) generated from engineered PEG-PBO-PCL triblock copolymers of various sizes in comparison with PEG-PCL diblocks as control standards. Specific Aim 2: To assess the impact of the nature and length of non-hydrolyzable PBO hydrophobic linker on chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel loading and release profile, toxicity and circulation time of engineered PEG-PBO-PCL triblock copolymers of various sizes in comparison with PEG-PCL diblocks, in vitro and in vivo, using animal models of breast cancer. In our opinion the proposed research is innovative because separating the two interfaces will increase the resilience of the polymeric material and its self- assemblies in blood following systemic delivery, will improve circulation time and shelf stability of DDS, and will efficiently modulate its drug loading and release properties. This contribution will be significant because it may lead to the development of DDSs with enhanced circulation time and selective in vivo stability, suitable for targeting, with enhanced shelf stability and improved drug loading/release and toxicity profiles."

"9534368","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular Dystrophy surveillance, racking, and Research Network (MD STARnet) was established in 2002 to conduct population-based surveillance and long-term follow-up of cases with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DBMD); longitudinal surveillance for DBMD has been ongoing since 2004. In 2011, the MD STARnet was expanded to include cross- sectional surveillance for seven additional MDs (congenital, distal, Emery-Dreifuss, facioscapulohumeral, limb-girdle, myotonic, and oculopharyngeal). Our Iowa Site was one of four charter awardees for the MD STARnet in 2002 and was refunded in 2006 and 2011. As an MD STARnet site, we have successfully integrated clinical, programmatic, and referral resources provided by key partners in Iowa, such as the Iowa Neuromuscular Program, with the active, population-based resources of the Iowa Registry for Congenital and Inherited Disorders to conduct longitudinal surveillance of DBMD and cross-sectional surveillance for the additional MDs. Also, our partnership with the Reproductive Molecular Epidemiology Research and Education Program at The University of Iowa has provided experienced investigators to conduct data analyses and publish MD STARnet data. Overall, our infrastructure in Iowa now serves to advance knowledge about the prevalence of MD, clinical care for and co-morbidities diagnosed among MD cases, and the influence of family characteristics and social support on clinical outcomes. We propose to use our highly skilled and successful team to expand surveillance and research activities for MDs and to include additional, selected neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), specifically congenital myopathies, spinal muscle atrophy, Pompe disease and Charcot-Marie- Tooth disease. To accomplish this, we aim to: 1) build new and maintain existing relationships with MD and other NMD partners to enhance and promote surveillance efforts; 2) conduct longitudinal, population-based surveillance and research for all MDs by reviewing medical records and accessing administrative data; 3) pilot longitudinal surveillance for additional, selected NMDs; 4) develop and implement a communications plan to disseminate surveillance and research results to partners, patients, and policy makers to improve access to services and care; and 5) collaborate with CDC and other grantees to develop and implement an evaluation plan for the multi-site surveillance system. Using our proposed, population-based approach, we can gain increased insights into the epidemiology of MD and these additional NMDs and their complications. The data collected can also aid in providing treatment and support options beneficial to affected individuals and their families."
"9454548","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early obesity puts children at increased risk for adult obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), early mortality, and other risks relative to normal weight children. Most parents of obese children are not concerned about their child's weight, and parents grossly underestimate the probabilities that their child will be obese and develop CVD in adulthood. Parents of obese children who have enrolled in obesity treatment programs cite a desire to improve their child's long-term health as a reason for engaging in behavior change. Concern about a child's health may be an important facilitator for behavior change engagement. Therefore, we are interested in understanding ways to promote accurate understanding of children's long-term health risks in order to raise an appropriate level of concern about obese children's weight and increase uptake of healthful behaviors. Health care providers are essential to help parents understand whether their child is on a healthy weight trajectory, but providers do not have effective tools for talking to parents about obesity and its associated adverse health risks; BMI growth charts alone are insufficient. This proposal's overall research goal is to identiy clinic-based risk communication approaches that can motivate parents of obese children to engage in behavior change to prevent future obesity and CVD. In Aim 1, we will develop novel risk communication messages. We will consider several novel approaches around message content and framing, but primarily, we propose using microsimulation models to forecast a child's long-term health risks, based on his age, race, gender, BMI, and family history of CVD. Qualitative interviews with providers and parents, and a stakeholder panel comprised of health researchers and parent research partners, will be used to evaluate potentially effective and acceptable messages. In Aim 2, we will experimentally evaluate the efficacy of four novel risk communication messages on parental behavior change willingness and intent using a national web-based survey. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the acceptability and effectiveness of new risk communication messages in a clinical setting, and we will observe the impact of new messages on behavior change activities. A survey will assess parent-perceived risks, perceived message accuracy, concern about child health, and anxiety. This research plan is part of a K01 proposal designed to provide scholarly training, mentorship, and support for Dr. Wright to gain skills and experience needed to conduct research on how improved obesity-related risk communication messages may affect child behavior change. Dr. Wright is a decision scientist whose career goal is to become an independent investigator with a focus on using decision science methods to motivate uptake of childhood obesity treatment and behavior change. To achieve this objective, she will pursue training in: (1) the psychology of medical decision making and principles of pediatric risk communication, (2) qualitative research methods, and (3) the design, implementation, and evaluation of behavioral health interventions.

"9452741","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 20 million people in the United States. Family members of patients with CKD, particularly diabetic kidney disease, are at increased risk of developing CKD themselves. However, genetic studies cannot yet account for this apparent heritability; neither can known environmental risk factors, such as diabetes or hypertension. Our proposal is aimed at investigating whether the interaction between the environment and the DNA can account for this heritability. Environmental factors, such as diabetes, are known to affect DNA control mechanisms, called epigenetics. The epigenome controls whether DNA is active or inactive by making changes to the DNA that do not change the nucleotide sequence itself. These changes in turn lead to changes in the level of gene expression. Our study will investigate this mechanism on a genome wide level in human kidney tissue. We will examine both genome wide changes to the epigenome, specifically cytosine methylation, and gene expression levels in human kidney samples. We will compare human kidney samples with diabetic kidney disease to control samples, both with and without diabetes, in order to identify epigenetic changes that may cause disease development. We will compare samples with diabetic kidney disease to samples with hypertensive kidney disease in order to distinguish the effects of these environmental phenotypes. In addition, we will analyze changes to the epigenome, which are associated with rapid progression to kidney failure. We will analyze the genomic locations of these changes in order to identify novel pathways involved in CKD development and progression. These pathways may represent therapeutic targets for the prevention of kidney failure."
"9452003","Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have great potential to counter biological warfare agents that are not addressed by currently available countermeasures. mAbs display exquisite specificity, are able to recruit host immune components to fight infection, confer near-immediate immunity once administered, can be successfully administered to all populations regardless of current immune status, and have a generally low rate of adverse reactions. The Industrialization Core's main responsibility will be to lead the translational research effort for the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Immunotherapeutic Consortium (VHF-IC). The members of the Core have extensive experience with translating mAb research concepts into IND-enabling preclinical therapeutics for infectious diseases.

"9428938","Project Summary Cerebral palsy is one of the common chronic childhood neurological disorders and has no effective cure. Half a million children under the age of 18 in the US have CP, and 1 in 6 children have some form of developmental disability. Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and maternal-fetal inflammation/immune dysregulation are major causes of cerebral palsy and related disabilities. Although the collective evidence from at least 6-large clinical trials confirms that therapeutic hypothermia improves outcome, 40%-50% of infants treated with hypothermia still die or suffer significant neurologic disability. There remains a critical need for development of therapies for patients who do not qualify for hypothermia, and for adjunct therapies with hypothermia that improve neuroprotection and address the negative effects of hypothermia and rewarming. This is the goal of this 3½ year NINDS CREATE DISCOVERY project.  Recent studies suggest that attenuating neuroinflammation, mediated by activated glia, in the early stages can not only delay the onset, but may also provide a longer therapeutic window for treatment. However, delivering drugs across the blood-brain-barrier to target and treat diffuse neuroinflammation is a major challenge. Our team discovered that systemically-administered hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers (~4 nm) target activated glia in the injured brain, without the need for targeting ligands. Interestingly, intravenous administration of the anti-inflammatory drug N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) conjugated to the dendrimer (D-NAC), in clinically-relevant preclinical models of CP, resulted in striking neuroprotective effects. Building on our strong proof-of concept data using our lead compound D-NAC, we propose to optimize this compound further for use in perinatal/neonatal brain injury, during the discovery phase of the CREATE application, for progressing towards an eventual developmental phase and clinical trials. Three aims are identified, along with appropriate milestones: (1) Optimize the synthesis of D-NAC for scale up production, and demonstrate reproducibility, purity and storage stability. (2) Determine pharmacokinetics, PK-PD relationship, minimal effective dose, optimal dose and elimination of D-NAC in rabbit model of cerebral palsy. (3) Determine long term efficacy of D-NAC at the optimal dose identified in Aim 2, in rabbit model of maternal inflammation induced CP and in term mouse hypoxic-ischemia model with hypothermia."
"9441689","Project Summary  Ablation of germ cells (GCs) extends lifespan in various species, providing paradigms for tradeoffs between reproduction and longevity, modulation of aging by signaling between tissues, and responses to metabolic perturbation. We recently identified a critical mechanism in this pathway in C. elegans: a response to fat overload that occurs when lipids that were produced for reproduction are not consumed. In the digestive system counterpart (intestine), this lipid accumulates and induces nuclear localization of the transcription factor SKN-1, the Nrf protein ortholog. SKN-1 activates lipid metabolism genes, reduces fat levels, and increases lifespan. SKN-1 and Nrf proteins are well known to respond to stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS), but GC ablation activates SKN-1 through a different pathway that is largely uncharacterized. This novel pathway involves fatty acid (FA)-dependent signals, specific lipid transport and metabolism activities, the gasotransmitter H2S, and 150 genes we have identified by RNA intereference (RNAi) screening. It is possible that this pathway may be triggered by particular FAs, or by bioactive lipid mediators (LMs) derived from them. In C. elegans we have collaboratively detected low-abundance LMs that promote or resolve inflammation in humans. GC ablation appears to alter their profiles, suggesting an ?inflammatory?-like response. Our findings provide a new genetically tractable platform for (1) uncovering how organisms respond to lipid overload, and (2) elucidating how specific lipid-based signals regulate gene expression and possibly aging. They also may represent a paradigm for understanding how mammalian Nrf proteins protect against fatty liver disease.  This project will address a number of exciting questions. Aim 1 will elucidate lipid-dependent effects of GC ablation. Analysis of tissue-specific gene expression in the intestine and studies of particular SKN-1 isoforms will reveal FA-dependent effects that are mediated by SKN-1, and other regulators. Studies of FA profiling and ?-oxidation will reveal whether SKN-1 mediates effects that correlate with these gene expression changes. Our LM detection effort will identify candidate LMs that are modulated by GC ablation, and will enable study of these important regulators in this genetically tractable organism. Aim 2 will reveal how GC ablation and lipid signals activate SKN-1 and possibly other regulators. A combination of FA biosynthesis enzyme knockdown with administration of specific FAs and LMs should identify specific lipids that mediate these effects. Completion of our RNAi screening will suggest additional mechanisms through which GC ablation activates SKN-1. Finally, in the centerpiece of this project, epistasis and model-driven experiments will place H2S and lipid signals within this new pathway, and will elucidate the involvement of candidate regulatory mechanisms that our results have identified. Completion of these aims will provide new insights into lipid-based gene regulation, control of SKN-1/Nrf, and longevity assurance, thereby having major impacts in the fields of aging, stress responses, lipid metabolism, and lipid-based signaling."
"9472493","Project Summary Reductions in the prevalence of multiple adolescent risk behaviors such as binge drinking, use of most illicit drugs, early sexual debut, crime, and violence have occurred in recent decades. It is unknown whether these are separate trends or if they reflect a broader reduction in the propensity to engage in risk behavior. This is an essential question because the potential set of causes for behavior-specific trends is very different from those that might explain a unitary trend related to risk-behavior propensity. Separate trends imply separate, behavior- specific causes (e.g. alcohol policies, sexual health education). But if these concurrent trends reflect a reduction in risk for multiple outcomes, the explanation likely involves individual-level factors such as predisposition to externalizing behaviors. Using 25 years of data from 3 national monitoring surveys, this project will be the first to address this question as it will be the first epidemiological study to examine multiple trends as a behavioral syndrome rather than as separate phenomena. This will involve methodological innovation as it requires multivariate methods that are not typically used in epidemiological trend studies. Informed by Problem Behavior Theory, the overarching purpose of the proposed project is to identify whether reductions in risk behaviors reflect reductions in an underlying trait or ?Risk Behavior Syndrome.? The project is significant because characterizing the phenomena is a first step toward understanding its causes. We will also examine changes in theoretically relevant psychosocial risk and protective factors that correlate with trends in risk behaviors. This will shift the focus of our research question from ?What?? to ?Why?? A broader understanding of individual-level risk and protective factors associated these trends can help refine existing hypotheses about causal factors and may lead to new hypotheses. We will utilize Item Response Theory modeling and tests of measurement invariance over time to examine the degree to which trends in risk behaviors reflect trends in an underlying Risk Behavior Syndrome. We will construct factors related to 4 canonical domains of risk behavior: alcohol and drug use, delinquency, early substance initiation, and sexual behaviors. We will model those as a function of a higher-order factor and incorporate risk and protective factors into the model. This will be the first-ever study of population trends in multiple risk behaviors and the relations among them. We hypothesize that the trends reflect changes in liability for Risk Behavior Syndrome and that this broader trend accounts for much of the decline in binge drinking. Successful accomplishment of these aims will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of secular trends of interest to multiple disciplines and identify salient risk and protective factors. By developing an integrated model of change, we will establish a firm scientific groundwork for formal studies of causality."
"9428408","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging-related denervation of skeletal muscle results in a significant loss of independence in the elderly population. With age, motor neuron (MN) axons are retracted from the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), leaving behind denervated muscle fibers that cannot be recruited during muscle contraction. This age-related denervation occurs in both humans and animal models, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Recent evidence suggests a new mediator for age-related synapse loss: proteins of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI). MHCI mRNA is constitutively expressed in adult spinal MNs, and MN MHCI levels increase significantly with age. In contrast, in muscles that are resistant to age-related denervation (e.g., the extraocular muscles), MNs consistently express much lower levels of MHCI. These results suggest a model in which MHCI expression contributes to age-related synapse loss at the NMJ.  Retraction of MN axons from the NMJ is not limited to aging: it is also a critical aspect of normal development. MN axons retract during the course of postnatal vertebrate development, removing the supernumerary MN inputs that form prenatally. Our preliminary data show that MHCI is expressed during developmental synapse elimination at the NMJ. We also find that developmental synapse elimination is significantly impaired in MHCI-deficient mice. This proposal is guided by the hypothesis that MHCI contributes to removal of MN axons at the NMJ, both during developmental synapse elimination and aging-related synapse loss.  The goals of this project are three-fold: 1) Using a MHCI-deficient transgenic mouse model, we will determine if reducing MHCI expression ameliorates aging-related synapse loss at the NMJ. 2) Using RT-PCR and transgenic mouse lines, we will determine if classical MHCIs are required for MN retraction. 3) By expanding our studies to muscles of different fiber type compositions and labeling these fiber types in MHCI- deficient mice, we will determine if MHCI triggers MN retraction specifically at slow twitch muscle fibers.  Together, the proposed studies will define the role of MHCI in developmental synapse elimination and aging-associated synapse loss, and could suggest unexpected, immune-based strategies to protect aged muscles from denervation."
"9563771","PROJECT SUMMARY Use of public transit has been associated with increased physical activity, and considered a promising approach to reducing the risk of obesity and other age-related chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. However, little is known about the physical activity impacts of the increasingly popular Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) which combines the capacity, speed, and reliability of rail transit with the flexibility and cost advantage of a conventional bus system. Further, research is lacking about impacts of transit-oriented multilevel interventions (TOMI) that simultaneously consider multiple synergetic strategies to promote physical activity. This timely natural-experimental study uses a pre-post (opening of new BRT corridors in El Paso, Texas, fall 2018), case- comparison design to examine the causal impact of BRT and other supporting TOMI strategies on residents? physical activity. The study involves 750 exposed (living within 0.5 miles from a new BRT station) and 500 non-exposed (living beyond 1 mile from any BRT stations) adult participants who live in the city and do not meet weekly physical activity recommendations (150+ minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA) at baseline. The specific aims of this proposed study are to (1) determine physical activity impacts of BRT; (2) examine physical activity impacts of additional TOMI strategies, including education (lifting the knowledge barrier by offering a smartphone app and training to assist transit trip scheduling and to enhance knowledge about using BRT and BRT-reachable physical activity resources) and cost (lifting the financial barrier to transit use by executing an introductory free-fare strategy); and (3) explore benefits and costs of BRT implementation, and barriers and facilitators of BRT use. There will be three waves of data collection in spring 2018, spring 2019, and spring 2021, respectively. The multidisciplinary team (experts from urban planning, transportation, public health, statistics and disparities research) proposes many innovative policy, theoretical and methodological advances to understand the obesity reduction roles of service-oriented environmental interventions. These include a) conceptualization of multi-level factors influencing and strategies for modifying transit use, b) inclusion of multiple case-comparisons, c) application of relevant methodological approaches more commonly used in other research queries, and d) a citizen science approach for more contextual understanding of the PA-transit relationship. Its strong connection with the local communities and stakeholders and substantial record of research collaboration ensure an effective execution of the proposed research. At the end of the proposed study, the researchers expect to identify the physical activity impact of BRT and other TOMI strategies, examine the benefits and costs of BRT implementation, and reveal barriers and facilitators of BRT use."

"9668982","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular Dystrophy surveillance, tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet) was established in 2002 to conduct population-based surveillance and long-term follow-up of individuals with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD). Longitudinal surveillance for DBMD has been ongoing since 2004. Active follow-up commenced in 2007 by administering telephone interviews to primary caregivers of DBMD cases to determine medical interventions and influence of family characteristics, geography, insurance status, and social support on clinical outcomes. Additional follow-up administered included mailed surveys to adult DBMD cases and their caregivers to examine needs and quality of life for these individuals and, most recently to describe transitions from pediatric to adult clinical care and other life experiences for late-adolescent and adult DBMD cases. In 2012, the MD STARnet was expanded to include cross-sectional surveillance for seven additional MDs (congenital, distal, Emery-Dreifuss, facioscapulohumeral, limb-girdle, myotonic, and oculopharyngeal). Our Iowa Site was one of four charter awardees for the MD STARnet in 2002 and was successfully refunded in 2006 and 2011. The Iowa Site has also served as the national MD STARnet Data Coordinating Center (DCC) since it was established in 2003. As the DCC, we successfully created and implemented an infrastructure that provided informatics expertise and support for all population-based DBMD longitudinal surveillance and research activities and for population-based cross-sectional surveillance for the additional MDs. We propose to continue as the DCC to provide expert informatics support for surveillance and research of MDs and selected neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop and maintain software applications, databases, and related documentation for surveillance data collection and analysis; 2) manage the pooling, cleaning, and dissemination of surveillance data collected by each project site; 3) distribute and provide support for application and databases required for surveillance data collection, clinical review, and data analysis; 4) provide technical assistance through participation in workgroups, committees, and in-person meetings; and 5) participate in the planning and implementation of the project evaluation plan. The Iowa Site has been successful with funding received to establish and operate the DCC, and we are enthusiastic about continuing such work. Continued use of our experienced DCC infrastructure will permit an efficient use of project resources for informatics expertise and support for surveillance and research activities for MDs and expansion of surveillance activities to selected NMDs."
"9441873","Tactile sensation is paramount to how we experience the physical world around us. Species like mice use their facial whiskers to navigate and assess their environment. Although there is a basic understanding of how brainstem trigeminal neurons, the first central relay for whisker-derived signals, respond to passive tactile stimuli, little is known about their activities and functions during active behaviors. Tactile exploration is an active sensing process, which adapts to behavioral purposes, and responses of trigeminal brainstem neurons are likely adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, brainstem projection neurons contribute to two main ascending pathways, lemniscal and paralemniscal, but the functions of these two distinct pathways remain unclear. Our goal for this high-risk exploratory grant application is to develop a chronic in vivo recording preparation, perform recordings from optogenetically identified lemniscal or paralemniscal projection neurons during active behaviors, and use causal manipulations to determine their functions. Recording and manipulating pathway-specific neurons in vivo, and making accurate behavioral measurements in freely moving animals are both challenging. We will use a combination of technological innovations to overcome these challenges. The outcome of this project will establish a platform for future in-depth dissection of how touch sensory information is integrated, transformed and delivered to different processing streams by trigeminal brainstem to generate perception, invoke emotion and/or inform decisions."
"9571666","This proposal describes a request for funds to purchase a Q-Exactive HF-X Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer with EASY-nLC 1200 System. The requested instrument is to upgrade the current proteomics capability in our facility with new features enabling identification of any known and unknown post-translational modifications (PTMs), label-free (MRM) and isobaric mass-labeled (TMT) protein quantitation, intact protein sequence analysis (top-down proteomics), and single amino acid polymorphism (SAAP) characterization over tissues and biopsies from healthy humans and patients with various diseases. Specifically, recent progress in Orbitrap-based mass spectrometry have dramatically increased the speed and accuracy of proteomics analysis, making it possible to determine the whole proteome of human tissues or cell lines with the highest accuracy and protein/peptide coverage. To take the advantage of the progress in hardware, new bioinformatic approaches, sophisticated algorithms, and big data clustering analysis have spontaneously emerged as new technologies to identify and quantify the whole proteomics for protein expression, isoform identification, unknown modifications and amino acid variations. These MS-based technologies have recently emerged to provide a high-throughput and in-depth proteomics platform for understanding the mechanisms of traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases in the elder veteran population. However, these new technologies are currently unavailable in our proteomics facility at VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) due to the outdated instrument for mass spectrometry. The present application describes our need for the requested instrument, its technical specifications, examples of how research can be furthered at VABHS through the use of this instrument, and a plan for its administration. In conclusion, the upgraded proteomics capability with the proposed instrument is urgently needed by our VA investigators and will be of particular importance in moving the discovery of VA-funded research into the next level of proteomics and uncovering the molecular mechanisms of VA-focused human diseases."

"9448661","PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes involves the generation of haploid gametes (in humans, sperm and egg cells) in meiosis, followed by the fusion of two gametes to produce diploid offspring. In meiosis, homologous chromosomes recognize one another and become physically linked through a modified homologous recombination DNA repair pathway, and the resulting crossovers enable accurate homolog segregation in the meiosis I division to reduce ploidy. In most eukaryotes including humans, chromosomes are organized as an array of chromatin loops by a highly conserved structure called the chromosome axis. The chromosome axis also recruits and controls DNA cleavage and recombination factors to mediate the formation of crossovers, and is remodeled after crossover formation in a key feedback pathway controlling recombination levels. Here, we propose to combine biochemistry, macromolecular structure, and genetics in both S. cerevisiae and the mouse to determine how the chromosome axis assembles, organizes chromosomes, and mediates crossover formation. We will first determine the structures of S. cerevisiae Red1 and mammalian SYCP2:SYCP3, functionally-related chromosome axis ?foundation? proteins that we have found share a conserved domain structure and propensity to self-assemble into filaments. We will next determine how these proteins interact with meiotic cohesin complexes, to understand the structural basis for axis-mediated chromosome organization. Next, we will dissect the network of interactions mediated by S. cerevisiae Hop1, a member of the conserved HORMAD family of axis proteins and a master regulator of meiotic recombination, and study how this interaction network changes during as meiotic prophase progresses. Hop1's eventual removal from the chromosome axis, an important feedback pathway controlling recombination levels, is mediated by the AAA+ ATPase Pch2. We will test our hypothesis that Pch2 directly recognizes a specific Hop1 conformation and partially unfolds its HORMA domain to mediate its removal from the axis. Finally, we will examine the structures, DNA binding specificity, and interactions of two meiosis- specific protein complexes, Msh4:Msh5 and Zip2:Zip4:Spo16, to learn how they stabilize specific DNA recombination intermediates and coordinate crossover formation with chromosome axis morphology changes. Overall, the work proposed here will result in a comprehensive molecular picture of how the chromosome axis assembles, coordinates crossover formation, and is then disassembled as recombination proceeds. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of the chromosome axis and associated factors is highly relevant to human health, as errors in meiotic chromosome segregation are a principal cause of miscarriage in humans, and are the source of ?aneuploidy disorders? like Down syndrome and Turner syndrome. Moreover, many cancer types show mis-expression of meiotic chromosome axis proteins, including TRIP13, HORMAD1, and SYCP2. A better understanding of these proteins' mechanisms in their native environment will be critical to determine how their mis-expression might lead to genome instability and cancer."

The first specific aim focuses on the synthesis and characterization of peptide amphiphiles that can form nanostructures in water. Diverse nanostructures, micelles and fibers, will be prepared and characterized using transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy among other approaches. Toxicity, binding affinity and cell internalization of a library of nanostructures containing the Claudin-1 targeting peptide will be assessed. Computational tools to modify the claudin-1 targeting peptide will be used to guide optimization of nanostructure targeting. The in vivo targeting efficacy of selected systems will then be examined. The encapsulation efficiency of different anticancer drugs inside the nanocarriers that demonstrate the best performance (based on toxicity, stability and cell binding) will be assessed. Finally, the dose-dependent toxicity of drugs encapsulated in selected nanostructures against colon tumor cells will be evaluated in comparison to free drug alone."
"9441688","Aging is associated with progressive immune dysfunction, resulting in blunted effector responses and increased susceptibility to infectious disease and cancers. A significant contributor to this decreased responsiveness is the impaired functionality of the most potent Ag-presenting cells, the dendritic cells (DCs). A key aspect of DC function is their capacity to ?cross-present? cell-associated Ag to CD8+T cells, a process that is required to cross-prime CD8+T cell responses against tumors or intra-cellular pathogens. However, the effect of aging on the acquisition, processing, and presentation of cell-associated Ags by primary DCs has barely been studied. We recently uncovered that aging significantly reduced the cross-presenting and cross-priming capacity of the DC subsets the most efficient at carrying out this important task (CD8?DCs and merocytic DCs). Aged DCs expressed normal MHC class I levels and were able to prime CD8+T cells to soluble peptides, but they were strikingly impaired in terms of phagocytosis of cell-associated materials. Mechanistically, the bio-energetic status, notably mitochondrial activity and membrane potential (??m), has been shown to regulate DC phagocytic capacity. Mitochondrial function was profoundly affected in murine CD8? or mcDCs, as shown by lower ??m, reduced ATP turnover and coupling efficiency, decreased baseline oxidative phosphorylation, and greater proton leak and ROS production. Old macaque CD1c+ DCs displayed similar defects, demonstrating dysfunction across species. Pharmacologic manipulation of young DCs to mimic the aged metabolic phenotype significantly impeded their phagocytic and cross-priming capacity, but in vitro scavenging of ROS by NAC significantly reversed the cross-presentation defect of aged! DCs. Our inter-related hypotheses are: (1) age-related changes in mitochondrial activity diminish the phagocytic and cross-presenting activity of murine DCs; and (2) improving mitochondrial activity will boost DC functionality and their potential as anti-tumor therapeutics in the elderly. These hypotheses will be tested in the following 3 aims. Aim 1 will identify the mechanisms underlying decreased mitochondrial fitness in aged murine DCs. We will dissect the effect of aging on DC use of, and dependence on, specific carbon sources and metabolic pathways to meet their energy needs. Moreover, we will assess whether the observed metabolic changes result from defects in the DC precursor, the aged environment in which they differentiate, or a combination of both. Aim 2 will determine whether improving mitochondrial activity of aged murine DCs increases their capacity to induce more vigorous T cell responses to cell-associated Ags in vitro, while Aim 3 will study the effect of improving mitochondrial function on their capacity to induce anti-tumor responses using well-established in vivo models of cross-presentation. !"
"9453686","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the most pressing challenges to the biomedical research community lies in the development of novel antimicrobials as a means of combating the evolution of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. As such, research in the van der Donk is focused on the study of lanthipeptides, a class of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products, which have demonstrated significant potential as antibiotics. Indeed, the antibiotic lanthipeptide, nisin, has been used in  the U.S. food industry for almost half a century with very few reports of antibiotic resistance. These natural products derive their name from the presence of lanthionine rings within their structure, which are formed through the conjugation of cysteine thiols to dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine residues within the maturing lanthipeptide. It has recently been found that LanBs, the enzymes responsible for the generation of dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine residues in some lanthipeptides, rely upon glutamyl-tRNAGlu in order to glutamylate and subsequently eliminate the hydroxyl-group from serine and threonine. Unfortunately, little is known about the enzymatic mechanisms by which this occurs or how it is regulated. Therefore, through the use of isotopically labeled cofactors, non-reactive substrate mimics, mutagenesis, and enzyme kinetics analysis, the research proposed herein is designed to examine the chemical and structural features that underlie LanB activity. The specific goals to be achieved include the determination of the mechanism and chemoselectivity of glutamate transfer by NisB, the structural elucidation of the glutamylation and elimination active sites, and the molecular mechanisms that determine tRNA cofactor recognition. Through a better understanding of these properties, our overall objective is to better understand lanthipeptide biosynthesis in order to inform the development of novel antibiotic and therapeutic compounds."
"9644473","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The molecular targets for photoreceptor degenerations and uveitis (intraocular inflammation) are poorly understood. A major barrier to progress has been the lack of any specific molecular cause. This proposal builds on our exciting discovery of calcium-activated CAPN5 (calpain-5) as the cause of Autosomal Dominant Neovascular Inflammatory Vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV). CAPN5 is the first nonsyndromic uveitis gene, and makes possible a highly innovative molecular-genetic approach for mechanism-based therapies for inflammation induced by photoreceptor degeneration. Photoreceptors express CAPN5, and an hCAPN5- R243L gain of function mutation in mice shows all the phenotypes of human ADNIV disease. The retina photoreceptors might be particularly sensitive to mutations in CAPN5, because high intracellular calcium is necessary and sufficient to regulate dark adaptation in photoreceptors. Our long-term goals are to find better and more specific treatments for photoreceptor degeneration. Our objective is to use our new hCAPN5-R243L mice to determine whether blocking CAPN5 activity can inhibit degeneration and uveitis. Our central hypothesis is that a calcium-activated CAPN5 pathway leads to ADNIV retinal degeneration and uveitis, and our transgenic CAPN5 mutant mouse is the best available animal model for testing several new uveitis therapies. Our specific aims are to (1) Treat photoreceptor degeneration in hCAPN5-R243L mice with a pharmacological CAPN5 inhibitor, (2) Rescue the photoreceptor phenotype in hCAPN5-R243L mice with a novel bipartite shRNA gene silencing vector, and (3) Treat uveitis in hCAPN5-R243L mice using commercially available neutralizing antibodies targeting IL-6 and IL-23. Impact. We expect to establish the hCAPN5-R243L mouse as a valuable animal model for testing novel therapies in ADNIV, which can be translated to patients. Our work should help determine the role of of calcium-activated CAPN5 signaling in ADNIV and other photoreceptor degenerations. Since hCAPN5-R243L disease stages phenocopy other eye diseases with photoreceptor degeneration and components of the CAPN5 pathway are found in other forms of uveitis, our studies could have a broad, positive impact, beyond ADNIV and uveitis patients, where components of the CAPN5 pathway may be therapeutic targets."

"9457676","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The current project builds on our previous efforts to define and characterize cancer cells of origin within the epidermis. We demonstrated that hair follicle stem cells are cells of origin for squamous cell carcinoma, and that the inherent quiescence of these cells acts as a tumor suppressor mechanism. The current proposal seeks to understand the role metabolism plays in both maintaining HFSCs, and also in their ability to initiate tumorigenesis. Our preliminary data suggests that HFSCs possess a unique mode of metabolism, and we seek to understand if this metabolic state is necessary to maintain these cells as quiescent, multipotent stem cells. We will extend our characterization of HFSCs to include metabolomics approaches and determine whether alteration of metabolic pathways disrupts their self-renewal or differentiation. Furthermore, with our inducible tumor initiation model, we will be able to characterize the full extent of any metabolic transitions that occur in vivo for the first time. We expect that these experiments will uncover novel mechanisms that regulate HFSC biology, and perhaps even point towards new targeted therapeutics for HFSC initiated tumors."
"9433685","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Avoidant and restrictive eating is common across youth mental health disorders, and is prospectively associated with poor growth, nutritional deficiencies, psychiatric symptoms, and psychosocial impairment. The newly introduced DSM-5 Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder includes some (but not all) avoidant and restrictive eating presentations. Initial evidence suggests that avoidant and restrictive eating is highly heterogeneous, with poor intake characterized by choking or vomiting phobias; loss of interest in feeding; and/or extreme food selectivity. Moreover, very little is known about its pathophysiology or long- term outcomes. Our study will leverage unique and complementary contributions of an international team with expertise in clinical psychology, child psychiatry, pediatrics, endocrinology, biostatistics and functional neuroimaging to investigate risk mechanisms and longitudinal outcomes of avoidant and restrictive eating.  We will establish a clinical cohort of children aged 8-18 years (n=100) and healthy controls (n=50) matched for sex, age, and Tanner stage to investigate how, across units of analysis, RDoC constructs contribute to avoidant and restrictive eating. First, we hypothesize that Negative Valence (acute threat/fear) over-activity (circuits: amygdala activation during a validated fear paradigm; hormones: cortisol and oxytocin; physiology: heart rate and skin conductance; self report: fear and trait anxiety) will correlate with phobic features. Second, we hypothesize that Arousal/Regulatory (homeostasis) dysfunction (circuits: hypothalamus and insula hypoactivation during a validated food paradigm; hormones: PYY, CKK, BDNF; self report: hunger and fullness) will correlate with low-appetite features. Third, we will explore Cognitive Systems (perception) over-sensitivity (circuits: hyperactivation in primary taste cortex during a taste paradigm; hormones: PYY; self report: sensory profile; behavior: taste and odor threshold, discrimination, and detection; physiology: taste perception) and its correlation with sensory features. We expect that the clinical cohort will have greater dysfunction across these 3 constructs than controls. We will then use latent class factor models to determine whether avoidant/restrictive eating comprises multiple distinct phenotypes (as prior literature assumes) or a single phenotype with 3 overlapping dimensions (as we hypothesize). We will follow our clinical cohort for 2 years to evaluate a) the persistence of avoidant/restrictive eating, growth, and psychopathology outcomes; and b) if dysfunction in all 3 RDoC constructs predicts outcomes. This study will be innovative and unique in 3 ways: 1) by providing an empirical investigation of an understudied clinical presentation; 2) by providing the first investigation of pathophysiology and risk mechanisms; and 3) by characterizing poorly understood longitudinal outcomes.

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a generally devastating neuropsychiatric illness with considerable morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal cost. Genetic factors have been strongly implicated via family and twin data, and more recently directly through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and sequencing studies. The primary objective of our project is to develop and apply advanced integrative methods for computational and functional analysis of networks, including but not limited to Bayesian network reconstruction and prediction algorithms of variant causality to identify key drivers of SCZ pathology for potential therapeutic intervention. To achieve this in Aim 1 we will construct single tissue and multi- tissue probabilistic causal network by applying a novel top-down and bottom-up or hypothesis-driven probabilistic causal network approaches in RNA sequencing key drivers of networks, novel pathways, and new mechanisms in SCZ pathology data from the CommonMind consortium, incorporating prior information. In Aim 2 we will use network models derived in Aim 1 in order to improve the predictive SCZ networks that could be used to identify SCZ-relevant transcription-based features that can be useful in therapeutic screening. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use modified RNA and cellular models to validate the network models, key drivers and investigate their phenotype effects."
"9529917","Project Summary Protein aggregation is the common defining feature in many age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease as well as systemic amyloidosis. Protein aggregates do not accumulate in normal healthy cells because of the existence of sophisticated cellular quality control pathways, the activity of which is progressively impaired during aging. While the core components of protein quality control pathways in virtually all cellular organelles have been identified, the fundamental question of how these pathways recognize their specific endogenous misfolded substrates remains elusive. A major bottleneck in addressing this question is that the endogenous misfolded proteins remain unidentified since there are no suitable tools to selectively separate them from the sea of abundant folded proteins. To approach this problem, we propose to develop innovative approaches to identify the endogenous misfolded proteins and their quality control components from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The misfolded secretory and membrane proteins in the ER are recognized by multiple ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways, which add ubiquitin to them and retrotranslocate them into the cytosol for the proteasomal degradation. These retrotranslocated misfolded proteins can be trapped as full-length proteins in the cytosol upon transiently inhibiting the proteasome. In the Aim 1, we will take advantage of this retrotranslocation process and develop novel retro-proteomic approaches to selectively purify retrotranslocated proteins from the cytosol using either through their ER-specific modifications or their association with the cytosolic chaperone Bag6. The purified proteins will be identified by quantitative mass spectrometry, which we term retro-proteomics. Furthermore, we will use the retro-proteomics to identify, for the first time, ER proteins that are prone to misfolding during oxidative stress, which has been associated with the aging process. In the Aim 2, we describe a highly innovative strategy to combine our retro- proteomics with CRISPR/Cas9 method to identify endogenous misfolded substrates for ER quality control components, particularly for E3 ligases. Our preliminary studies indicate that using this technique we can successfully identify numerous novel substrate candidates for the conserved Hrd1 E3 ligase. We will validate the misfolded proteins and their associated quality control pathways using protein turnover assays and metabolic labeling combined with quantitative mass spectrometry. We believe that the ability to catalog ER misfolded proteins and their quality control pathways will help us to understand how cells selectively recognize various types of misfolded proteins for degradation and why they poorly recognize them during aging. Answers to these questions may help with the development of targeted small molecules to improve protein folding during stress and aging."
"9449120","Abstract  Since blacks have long had a much lower life expectancy than whites, we argue that a dramatic and overlooked element of racial disadvantage and adversity is exposure to the death of family members. Latinos, on the other hand, have modestly higher life expectancy than whites and much higher life expectancy than blacks. This suggests that Latinos may have similar exposure to the death of family members as whites and much less exposure than blacks, which may be important in the relatively favorable health profile of Latinos in the United States. The proposed project will shift thinking about racial/ethnic disparities and health by focusing on the death of family members throughout the life course as a fundamental cause of lifelong and accumulating disadvantage that affects long-term health and longevity. We hypothesize that the death of family members is more common and occurs earlier in the life course among blacks than Latinos and whites. In turn, death exposures shape the integrated biopsychosocial pathways that lead to poorer health and increased mortality risk, uniquely contributing to racial/ethnic disparities in physical health and mortality. We further hypothesize that these pathways will differ for men and women because of gender differences in family relationships, health outcomes, and potential mediating mechanisms such as health behaviors. This project relies on data from two NIH-sponsored national, longitudinal datasets (the Health & Retirement Study and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health) to estimate race/ethnic differences in specific (e.g., parents, children, siblings, spouses) and cumulative exposures to the death of family members across the life course, and how those exposures uniquely contribute to health from young adulthood to later life.  Surprisingly little information is available concerning life course exposure to the death of multiple family members (and timing of deaths), and, in particular, racial/ethnic disparities in those exposures. The proposed project will provide the first in-depth and population-based analysis of race/ethnic differences in exposure to death of multiple family members from childhood through adulthood and how those exposures shape racial/ethnic disparities in health and mortality risk. This project is designed to produce a knowledge base that will inform specific and evidence-driven intervention and policy guidelines to address racial/ethnic disparities in health that result from exposure to death of multiple family members.  The research team includes leading scientists who are nationally recognized in population health research. The team is characterized by a complementary set of talents and experience that uniquely positions them to carry out this innovative project."
"9412195","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychosis is ranked as one of the most disabling conditions worldwide. Functional deterioration occurs at the fastest rate during the early phase of psychosis, which is both a critical period of neuronal and psychosocial plasticity and a window of opportunity during which treatment may confer disproportionately favorable outcomes. There is a large variability in the recovery trajectory and outcome of first episode of psychosis [FEP] patients. However, current algorithms do not allow differences in biological background or specific neurobiological profile to guide individualized treatments. Many neurobiological alterations, including neurocognitive deficits, subtle structural brain changes, electroencephalographic (EEG) measures, and clinical variables, collectively contribute to variance in functioning in FEP. We have used K-means multivariate classification analyses and identified three distinct Bio-classes of psychosis independent of diagnosis. Within each class, patients shared a similar neurobiological profile that uniquely distinguished among the groups. These data present a diagnosis-free approach to integrate information across biomarkers, yielding neurobiologically distinct subgroups and provide strong evidence supporting the superiority of neurobiological vs. clinical classification in differentiating psychotic disorders. Building on our prior work, the goal of this project is to stratify FEP patients into homogeneous subgroups based on patients' unique neurobiological profiles and relate these profiles to later functional outcome. This project will address four questions: 1) Are bio-classes characterized in the FEP similar to those observed in chronic psychosis patients? [Aim 1a]; 2) Are there structural neuroanatomical features associated with distinct bio-classes [Aim 1b]; 3) are bio-classes characterized at baseline predictive of later functional outcomes two years later, controlling for baseline severity and other confounding factors? [Aim 2a]; and 4) are bio-classes superior to DSM diagnoses in predicting functional outcomes? [Aim 2b]. This project will recruit a total of one hundred (n=120) FEP patients at two FEP clinics and 100 demographic matched controls. We will follow up FEP patients every 6 months for two years and collect an expanded biomarker panel as well as symptomatic and functional outcome measures at each time point. Patients will be bio-classified into one of the three bio-classes at baseline using a constellation of cognitive and EEG biomarkers. A comprehensive battery of clinical, premorbid, treatment, biomarker, and functional variables will be obtained at each time point. Brain structural measures, not used in forming the bio-classes, will be used to validate the distinctness of the bio-classes. We will examine the relationships between bio-classes and functional outcome and between DSM diagnoses and functional outcome at each time point. We will compare the two models and determine which one better explains variance in functioning after controlling potential confounding factors, such as baseline symptom severity, premorbid functioning, and duration of untreated illness."

"9421564","Fast-Track SBIR: Identification and validation of targets for therapeutic intervention in rare diseases of intermediary metabolism defects. ABSTRACT There are very few reliable methods to study and understand the biology of liver rare diseases in the laboratory for the purpose of drug discovery and development, which contributes to a dismal record for development of new treatments. First, genetic mouse models do not faithfully mimic human rare diseases. Second, modeling liver diseases in vitro is challenging on account of the rapid loss of the liver-like phenotype of primary hepatocytes in vitro. For these reasons, target ID, validation and prioritization can be misleading and costly. In 2014, HemoShear, LLC and Children's National Health System formed a strategic partnership to systematize and accelerate discovery and treatments for rare diseases of the liver. HemoShear is an early stage biotechnology company with a patented technology for recreating human liver disease biology in the laboratory using human primary cells. The Division of Genetics and Metabolism at Children's is a premier research center with the nation's largest clinical program that studies and treats patients with liver rare diseases. Under this partnership, we have already shown that biomaterial from patients treated at Children's can be used to validate the rare disease system developed at HemoShear for the identification of targets for therapeutic development [Chapman et al, Mol. Gen. Metab., 2015]. This study will focus on the biochemical group of diseases called organic acidemias, specifically propionic acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia. These rare diseases have high early and late mortality rates, there are no primary therapies for these conditions and patients often undergo liver transplant to control symptoms. The purpose of this FastTrack SBIR is to identify, validate and prioritize targets for the future development of therapies to treat patients with intermediary metabolism defects in the liver."

Infants who have myelomeningocele (MM), a type of SB, often have bladder problems resulting from their SB. These problems, if not managed properly, can lead to serious kidney damage. A new protocol for bladder management for children with SB has been developed. This proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the bladder management protocol in newborn infants with myelomeningocele. The objectives of this project are: 1) To implement this protocol at for all newborns with MM receiving inpatient care at SCH, 2) To evaluate the effectiveness of the protocol in preventing bladder and kidney problems in the first five years of life. Newborn infants who are receiving inpatient care at SCH for myelomeningocele and have not been hospitalized before will be eligible to participate. Data will be collected for each participant at their follow up visits, using data recorded in the hospitl electronic and paper medical record. Information about the child's diagnosis, treatment, and health outcomes will be collected. Data analysis will be guided by the study coordinating committee, and will be to identify how well the protocol was implemented and how often children develop kidney and bladder problems."
"9653367","Project Summary/Abstract  Hospital volume has been shown to be inversely correlated with surgical mortality rates in complex surgery. Since the popularization of its concept, there has been a push towards volume-based regionalization of pancreatectomy. This past year, three major health systems have imposed minimum- volume standards that will bar hospitals and surgeons not meeting the threshold from performing complex surgery, and are pushing for other health systems to pledge to the low-volume threshold mandate.  However, the impact of such a regionalization strategy on patient preferences and access to care remains unclear. Pancreatectomy has demonstrated the most pronounced association between volume and mortality rates, and represents the procedure that stands to gain the most from such a policy. However, national data demonstrates that up to 70% of patients with early stage pancreatic cancer do not receive surgical intervention, of which racial minorities, patients on Medicaid and the uninsured make up the majority of this cohort. This was hypothesized to be secondary to nihilism towards the disease and the complexity of the operation needed for hopes of long-term survival. As such, a proposed low-volume threshold mandate may cause unintended consequences by exerting more constraints on patients to receive care.  Preliminary data has demonstrated that the vulnerable cohort as described above tend to travel shorter distances for pancreatectomy, and often undergo the surgery at hospitals with poorer quality. The objective of this study is to assess the potential impact of the proposed low-volume threshold mandate on access to care in patients undergoing pancreatectomy. Specifically, we will quantitatively assess the impact on distance needed to travel by patients and overall mortality rates in a setting where all patients are redirected to high-volume centers, and a simulated setting where patients with lower likelihood of travelling do not receive care. Additionally, we will perform qualitative assessment of the facilitators and constraints that patients face to receive care.  When completed, this study will provide novel data highlighting the impact of volume-based regionalization on access to care. Additionally, it will bring attention to reduce current disparities in health care quality and access with respect to vulnerable populations, and inform interventions to alleviate the issue, a core goal of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Lastly, our study will provide stimulus for research in more appropriate measures of quality than volume, as volume may be over-simplifying a complex issue and a dangerous metric to be incentivizing hospitals on."
"9432438","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Musculoskeletal diseases are the most frequently reported medical conditions in the USA and the second- greatest cause of disability worldwide. Despite their medical importance, and the recognition that cellular topological relationships are key regulators in tissue development, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these relationships affect human skeletal development, maintenance, and repair, and how disruptions in topology lead to clinically relevant human disease. Prior studies showed that developing heterotopic ossification lesions had highly disorganized cellular structures. This contrasts sharply with the normal organized structures seen during skeletogenesis and suggests that changes in cell topology could contribute to disease pathogenesis. In this high risk/high yield proposal, we use new methods established by our team to elucidate how cellular topology affects bone development, and whether cellular topology contributes to the abnormal tissue integration that occurs in conditions of heterotopic ossification. We previously generated human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines from control subjects and subjects with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a congenital disease of massive heterotopic ossification induced by BMP signaling. We showed our ability to derive key bone cell lineages such as iPS cell-derived endothelial cells (iECs) and mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs), and that the FOP iECs but not FOP iMSCs could show early activation of osteogenic fate. In Aim 1, we will use a new 3D bioprinting strategy to create ?bone organoids? with defined topological arrangements using our iMSCs and iECs from both control and FOP patients. This system will elucidate how ECs and MSCs interact during osteogenesis in different 3D configurations. In Aim 2, we will implant slices of these organoids into the skeletal muscle of SCID mice to test if cell arrangement contributes to the abnormal integration of bone into skeletal muscle as seen in heterotopic ossification. Our approach has several key innovations, including the use of FACS-defined human iPS cell- derived lineages which can be reproducibly isolated; and the use of a new scaffold-free 3D cell printing strategy that allows us to assess cell-cell interactions that may reflect normal bone development more closely, without complications introduced by a persistent structural matrix. Together, these studies will generate new fundamental information in a clinically relevant context for understanding how topologic arrangements influence osteogenesis by human cells. This new understanding may reveal the developmental mechanisms for potentiating osteogenesis, identify if topology helps regulate normal separation of bone and muscle, and identify novel targets for blocking the debilitating integration of muscle and bone that occurs in heterotopic ossification. Finally, these studies will support future efforts to create more complex multicellular structures using highly-defined cells to model human the complex regulatory process of human bone growth in vitro."
"9559223","ABSTRACT Individuals with the rare, inherited disorder Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) develop thousands of precancerous polyps at an early age and ultimately develop colorectal cancer (CRC). The current standard of care for FAP is colectomy. However, unavoidable side-effects of colectomy are debilitating. Furthermore, colectomy does not prevent subsequent development of extra-colonic intestinal tumors, the main cause of death post-colectomy. There are currently no drugs FDA approved for the treatment or chemoprevention of FAP patients. We have demonstrated that pyrvinium can be repurposed as a potent inhibitor of WNT signaling and is efficacious in an animal model of FAP. Oral dosing of pyrvinium pamoate produces negligible systemic exposure and limits the exposure to the gut which reduces the likelihood of toxicity. Submitting these data to the FDA, we were awarded an Orphan Drug Designation to market pyrvinium exclusively for FAP patients. To clarify the steps required to take pyrvinium back into the clinic as a repurposed agent for FAP patients, using a 505(b)(2) regulatory mechanism, we recently had a pre-IND meeting with the FDA. This Phase I/II Fast-Track application is driven by the FDA?s recommendations for a successful Investigational New Drug (IND) application for pyrvinium in the treatment of FAP. The repurposing of pyrvinium for FAP patients, if successful, would represent 1) A major improvement in therapy and in the quality of life, and 2) The successful bench to bedside application of a rationally selected targeted therapy."
"9525621","ABSTRACT  The 9/11 World Trade Center terrorist attack was a massive disaster, resulting in long-term physical and psychological trauma to the responders, in particular PTSD and lower respiratory symptoms (LRS), with 10-20% of responders experiencing symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of PTSD a decade later. Our group found that PTSD in WTC responders is closely linked to their respiratory diseases, and PTSD mediated the relationship between WTC exposures and LRS. Genetic vulnerability and gene-environment interactions have been implicated in the etiology of PTSD. In our pilot study of a discovery cohort of N=195 WTC responders, we found significant differences in gene expression between responders with versus without a current WTC-PTSD diagnosis, using whole genome transcriptome analysis. Expression of relevant genes in remitted PTSD cases was intermediary between current cases and non-cases. Importantly, previously implicated genes (FKBP5, NR3C1) were differentially expressed along with several interleukin (IL4, IL2), insulin receptor, B-cell, lymphocytes and PTEN signaling pathways that are linked to inflammatory diseases and to cancers. We tested the resulting expression composite in an independent replication sample of N=87 responders and achieved an AUC of .734. The composite also showed a robust linear association with a self- reported measure of PTSD symptom severity, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) (Spearman r=0.422). These preliminary findings support the potential importance of gene expression research to identify biomarkers of PTSD. The proposed study builds on this exciting pilot work by evaluating association between changes in gene expression with changes in PTSD symptom severity and LRS across an 18-month period. Using our banked blood samples, we will conduct state-of-the-art high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to generate transcriptome profiles from whole blood at an average sequencing depth of 50M reads per sample per time point (for each of the two time points). In Aim 1 of this study, we will investigate the association between changes in gene expression (gene, isoform and splice variant levels) and changes in PTSD symptoms across an 18-month period at gene as well the genetic pathways implicated by these changes; and identify the Gene Expression Signature (GES) associated with change in PTSD symptoms. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether the GES is associated with change in each PTSD symptom dimension (re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, hyperarousal). We expect to find both common and distinct genes/pathways regulating the change in each PTSD symptom dimension. In Aim 3, we will test the directionality of prospective associations between the GES score and PTSD symptom severity, i.e., whether the GES at the first time point predicts PTSD severity 18 months later, and vice versa. In Aim 4, we will evaluate whether the change in GES is associated with change in LRS. We hypothesize that any association observed between the GES and LRS will be mediated by change in PTSD symptom severity, indicating shared biological mechanisms underpinning PTSD-LRS comorbidity. This will be the first longitudinal study to identify the gene and isoform expression signatures associated with change in PTSD symptoms overall, as well as each of four PTSD symptom dimensions and comorbid LRS. An in-depth understanding of the biological processes underpinning PTSD, and identification of its GES carries clinical significance by identifying processes that maintain PTSD and can be targeted for intervention, and will inform treatment development for WTC responders as well as other trauma-exposed populations."
"9668012","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Suicide, a primary cause of death among middle-aged men (35-64 years old), is the leading cause of injury death among men in this age group in Michigan (state where study takes place). Reliance on traditional mental health services to reach out to and engage men in this age group has not resulted in increased suicide problem recognition or help-seeking behavior. While effective treatment for suicide exists, treatment cannot help men who don't identify as having a problem, and therefore don't see help. The field lacks effective and efficient programs and interventions that actively engage middle-aged men in evidence-based interventions to increase suicide problem identification and help-seeking behavior. We will examine the effectiveness of a comprehensive online screening and referral intervention, specifically designed for men ages 35-64. Primary outcomes include suicide behavior (suicide attempts and preparatory acts), suicide ideation and depression. Secondary outcomes include: attitudes toward help-seeking and help-seeking behavior; suicide risk factors (i.e., alcohol abuse, relationship conflicts, financial problems and interpersonal needs7); and the protective factor of social support. Men who score in the moderate-to-high risk range for depression on the depression screen, or any score for suicide ideation and/or behavior on the suicide screen, will be asked to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Screening for Mental Health; or Screening for Mental Health, plus Man Therapy. Man Therapy is specifically designed for men who are at risk for suicide and less likely to engage in help-seeking behavior. A series of data analysis techniques will be used to evaluate the additive effect of Man Therapy. The core analysis will be a longitudinal mixed-model path analysis testing for between-group and within-group differences on primary and secondary outcomes. The model design will also include estimations of indirect effects (mediation and moderation). Data will be collected on primary outcomes of depression and suicidal behavior and ideation at baseline and then again at 2- and 12-weeks post randomization to study arm. Secondary outcomes will be measured 2- and 12-weeks post randomization to study arm. Using a sequential mixed-methods research design, researchers will interview a purposive sub-sample of men referred to both study arms to further assess and compare barriers and facilitators to men seeking suicide prevention services. This innovative study, which can be widely applicable to other states across the country, may advance suicide prevention among middle-aged men, a high-risk group for suicide who tend to be difficult to engage in suicide problem identification and help-seeking behavior."
"9397984","Vision loss is a highly significant problem in the veteran population, and the long-term goal of this research is the application of current neuroscientific insights to design novel rehabilitative approaches for visual rehabilitation of veterans with vision loss. The purpose of this SPiRE application is to lay the groundwork for a future Merit Review application examining the utility of adding telerehabilitative spatial cognitive training to orientation and mobility training that is the mainstay of low vision rehabilitation. Spatial cognitive abilities represent an important target for rehabilitation of individuals with vision loss. Specific Aim I will test the hypothesis that spatial cognitive training of blind veterans on a spatial imagery task leads to improvements in (a) performance on the trained spatial imagery task and (b) real-world navigational ability, relative to a control intervention. If the hypothesis is supported, this would be a simple method of spatial cognitive training with real-world benefits that can be administered via telemedicine. Specific Aim II will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the neural changes associated with spatial cognitive training. The hypothesis is that those in the spatial cognitive training group will show enhanced activation in brain regions mediating spatial processing, such as the hippocampus and parietal cortex, as well as more differentiated neural representations of imagined paths. The benefit of pinpointing the neural loci of change is the identification of potential targets for application of converging rehabilitation approaches, e.g. transcranial magnetic or electrical stimulation over parietal regions; enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis through aerobic exercise."
"9539380","PROJECT SUMMARY The assembly of individual neurons into interconnected networks is essential for sensation of external stimuli and induction of a behavioral response. When this circuitry is disrupted as in chronic pain and peripheral neuropathies, the effects can have a debilitating effect on quality of life. The majority of pain research has focused on functional properties of the peripheral somatosensory neurons, but the factors that drive the appropriate connectivity of these neurons to central interneurons could also lead to new avenues for treatment. In the brain, there is a dense neuropil of incoming neuronal axons and receptive neuronal dendrites, yet not all neurons can communicate with one another. For instance, sensory neurons responsive to light touch must identify distinct partner neurons from sensory neurons responsive to harsh touch. Thus, there is high impetus to promote selective neuronal partner matching, which ensures that a given sensory input will lead to a predictable, appropriate output response. Despite this centrality to ensuring reproducible reactions, little is known about how neurons select specific partners for synapse formation. A better understanding of developmental and molecular mechanisms that drive synaptic partner choice could help to uncover processes that are disrupted and driving the etiology of some pain neuropathies. This proposal aims to provide an inroad to initiate discovery of developmental mechanisms and genes that are involved in partner choice, and that could be key to revealing the molecular logic used in neuronal connectivity. This proposal will investigate connectivity in a compact nervous system, that of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, due to multiple advantages including genetic control of individual neurons, stereotyped connectivity, and methods to assess synaptic partner choice. Although separated evolutionarily by hundreds of millions of years, about 75% of genes are functionally conserved from D. melanogaster to humans, and it is likely that even if the genes identified in D. melanogaster partner choice do not have human homologs, the overall logic of how neurons select partners will be preserved across these species. Recent discoveries have begun to define a network of neurons of known connectivity in the D. melanogaster nervous system, and this study will focus primarily on two partner neurons, using additional neurons in the network to test questions of generalizability to other synaptic partners. In the first aim, functional mechanisms for establishing specificity among numerous potential partners will be interrogated. In the second aim, the individual molecules that mediate this synaptic recognition will be explored. Together, these two complementary developmental and molecular sets of experiments will allow the testing of the overall hypothesis that a combinatorial code of adhesion molecules instructs specificity in synaptic partner matching. !"
"9442665","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hippocampal neurogenesis is implicated in regulation of plasticity, learning and memory and experience in novel environments. However, the role of neurogenesis in learning and memory deficits and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of memory and cognitive decline, is not fully elucidated. We have shown that hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired early in life in animal models of Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Deficits in neurogenesis precede onset of hallmarks and onset of learning and memory impairments, suggesting that defective neurogenesis may play a role in the development of cognitive decline. In addition, we have shown that experience of mice in environmental enrichment rescues impaired neurogenesis and attenuate neuropathology. However, it is not clear whether impairments in neurogenesis in AD are causative and whether up regulation of neurogenesis would rescue cognitive deficits. To address that, we generated mouse models, in which neurogenesis is regulatable. Specifically, ablation of neurogenesis in APPswe/PS1?E9 was achieved by ganciclovir-induced depletion of neural progenitor cells expressing a modified version of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (APPswePS1?E9/nestin-?-HSV-TK mice). Enhancement of neurogenesis in APPswe/PS1?E9 mice was achieved by tamoxifen-induced ablation of Bax in neural progenitor cells (APPswePS1?E9/nestin-CreERT2/Baxlox/lox mice). In a preliminary study we show that ganciclovir-treated APPswePS1?E9/nestin-?-HSV-TK mice exhibit significantly reduced extent of neurogenesis accompanied by deficits in contextual encoding, pattern separation and novel object recognition, as early as three months of age. Intriguingly, we observed more amyloid deposition in the hippocampus of these mice compared to vehicle-treated APPswePS1?E9/nestin-?-HSV-TK or APPswePS1?E9 mice. Taken together, these observations suggest the hypothesis that impaired hippocampal neurogenesis plays a key role in the development of cognitive deficits and neuropathology in AD, and that enhancement of neurogenesis would restore these deficits. Experiments will determine the effect of loss or gain of neurogenesis in FAD mice on extent of proliferation, survival and cell fate determination of hippocampal neural progenitor cells and new neurons (Specific Aim 1), progression of neuropathology (Specific Aim 2) and learning and memory (Specific Aim 3). In Specific Aim 4 we will examine the association between extent of neurogenesis, level of cognitive function and neuropathology in human brain tissue of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD patients. These experiments will determine the role of neurogenesis in AD and lead to the development of neurogenesis-based treatment of cognitive deficits in the disease."
"9459834","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected individuals face a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), even when viremia is suppressed by combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Mechanisms underlying HIV-associated CVD risk are incompletely understood and specific guidelines on cardioprotective care for this population are not available. Characterizing and reducing CVD risk among HIV-infected women represents a particular challenge. HIV-infected women have a lower prevalence of select traditional CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension, smoking) and are less likely than HIV-infected men to be offered preventive cardiac care in clinical practice. However, several studies suggest women with HIV are just as likely as their male counterparts to incur an MI. Indeed, a large-scale US epidemiologic study shows that among HIV-infected women, unadjusted rates of MI modestly exceed those among HIV-infected men. Moreover, the same study reveals a significantly higher adjusted relative risk of MI in HIV infected-women versus uninfected females (2.89) as compared with HIV-infected men versus uninfected males (1.4). The proposed study aims to identify sex-specific mechanisms of CVD risk and risk reduction in HIV, addressing an NIH research priority. Importantly, the proposed study leverages the infrastructure of the largest primary prevention trial in the field of HIV-associated CVD: The Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV (REPRIEVE, A5332). The REPRIEVE trial, now launching, will test among 6500 HIV-infected persons ages 40-75 with low traditional CVD risk scores whether statin therapy reduces clinical cardiovascular events. Statin therapy has appeal in HIV in that it both reduces LDL cholesterol levels and dampens atherogenic immune activation, which persists in persons with HIV on cART. Work from our group and others suggests immune activation is highest in HIV-infected women (vs. HIV-infected men), particularly among those women who have undergone menopause. Through the proposed project, we will assess whether immune activation contributes uniquely to CVD risk among HIV-infected women across the reproductive aging spectrum and how statins may reduce CVD risk through effects on this pathway. Answers to these questions will influence the development of CVD prediction and prevention strategies tailored to the aging female HIV-infected population worldwide (~17 million). Maximizing our power to elucidate sex-specific CVD mechanisms in HIV, we will also design, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of an evidence-based education/awareness recruitment campaign to enhance female enrollment in the REPRIEVE trial."

We also need a scalable HCSP that allows us to incrementally expand our storage capacity as the neuroimaging portfolio at VA Boston and the NeRVe continues to grow. This research data involves tens of millions of dollars of Veteran research results and analysis, addressing important health concerns in our Veterans including brain injury, PTSD, aging, dementia, and substance abuse."
"9492133","Project Summary T Stellate cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) form an important ascending pathway that transmits spectral information from the auditory nerve to numerous auditory nuclei. They innervate the olivocochlear efferents in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body, the lateral superior olive, the inferior colliculi and the thalamus. In preliminary experiments we have discovered that groups of T stellate cells within an isofrequency lamina are bidirectionally interconnected through excitatory synaptic connections that can be potentiated. In dual, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from T stellate cells, firing in a presynaptic cell generally evoked no EPSCs in the postsynaptic cell unless presynaptic firing was paired with postsynaptic depolarization. These findings are exciting for two reasons. First is that the mechanism underlying that potentiation is new and unprecedented. Postsynaptic depolarization increased the probability of recorded EPSCs, a presynaptic function, implicating the involvement of a retrograde messenger. Our preliminary results support the hypothesis that nitric oxide serves as that retrograde signal. Aim 1 is to use intracellular recordings in slices to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie potentiation of connections between T stellate cells and to understand their source and dynamics. We will identify what neurons participate in polysynaptic connections, how synaptic excitation by auditory nerve fibers affects the plasticity of interconnections, examine signaling through the nitric oxide pathway, and measure rates at which potentiation develop and fade. Second is that our discovery reveals a new form of central gain control at the network level. Bidirectional, excitatory interconnections indicate that T stellate cells in an isofrequency lamina form a network and could explain how T stellate cells can sharpen the encoding of spectral peaks. These interconnections could also form synaptic positive feedback loops that lead to hyperexcitability in the face of loss of auditory nerve fibers and the consequent uncoupling of excitation and inhibition. Aim 2 is to use computational neural models to understand the implications of excitatory interconnections between T stellate cells on their encoding of sound. We will implement models that can simulate the response features of single T stellate cells and build an interconnected neural network to understand how network connectivity contributes to potentiation. We will test the hypothesis that excitatory interconnections enhance the encoding of spectral peaks and that inhibition is required to stabilize the network."
"9436543","Project Summary Despite recent advances in uncovering the role of circadian clocks in cardiometabolic disease, a gap remains in our understanding of how nutrient and circadian transcriptional regulators coordinate responses to environmental stimuli across the 24-hour cycle in a tissue-specific manner. In my recently published K01-funded studies, I have discovered reciprocal interactions between the skeletal muscle circadian clock and the nutrient-sensitive hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription pathway. Specifically, I found that (i) that circadian transcription factors regulate hypoxic HIF1? activation and anaerobic glycolysis in muscle myotubes, (ii) hypoxia/HIF reciprocally regulates clock transcriptional activity and period length in myotubes, and (iii) the circadian clock establishes time-of-day dependent response to exercise-induced HIF activation in skeletal muscle. Collectively, our data reveal coupling of the hypoxia-inducible factor and circadian pathway producing rhythmic adaptation to hypoxic stress. However, it is still unclear how this coupling occurs and whether in vivo circadian disruption would impair HIF-dependent functions, such as muscle glucose uptake and acute strenuous exercise tolerance. My present proposed studies are to utilize an array of innovative models and techniques to build upon my current findings to understand the interplay between hypoxic and circadian transcriptional pathways at the genomic, nutrient-signaling, and whole-animal physiological levels. Overall, these studies will advance our understanding of the role of circadian clocks in muscle metabolic function and disease."
"9507631","PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is common among older individuals and typically associated with episodic memory loss. The pathophysiological processes of AD begin decades before the emergence of clinical symptoms of dementia, providing an opportunity to understand early disease mechanisms and the contribution of this pathology to memory decline in ?normal? aging. Along these lines, reductions in memory within the clinically normal range are observed across the lifespan, showing subtle but consistent decrements at each decade between the 20's and 80's. Interestingly, the two hallmark pathologies of AD, the accumulation of Tau into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and beta-amyloid (A?) into plaques, show distinct time courses and regional involvement across the lifespan. Specifically, NFTs restricted to the entorhinal cortex are common in middle age and ubiquitous in older age (50% of 50 year olds and 90% of 70 years olds have NFTs in entorhinal cortex), whereas abnormal A? is uncommon in middle age but prevalent at older ages and tends to be distributed throughout cortex (10% of 60 year olds and 30% of 75 year olds). Exacerbation of NFTs in entorhinal cortex and into other portions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and neocortex is coupled with A? accumulation. Recent advances in human PET imaging now enable in vivo visualization of Tau accumulation, providing a critical opportunity to establish the impact of Tau accumulation and the synergistic interaction between Tau and A? on memory decline in aging. However, the ability to measure PET signal directly from the hippocampus using first generation Tau tracers, such as AV1451, have been compromised by off-target binding in the choroid plexus adjacent to the hippocampus. Recently evolving second-generation tracers that show less off-target binding to choroid plexus, such as [18]F-PI2620, may improve the ability to investigate Tau in the aging hippocampus. Moreover, advancements in MRI enable the collection of ultra high-resolution structural and high-resolution functional measures of MTL subregions (via 7T and 3T scanning). We therefore propose to incorporate a novel second-generation Tau tracer into an ongoing neuroimaging study of aging at Stanford with existing MRI and CSF data (PI: Anthony Wagner, R01AG048076) to enable the comparison of regional Tau in entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus to high-resolution measures of MTL integrity. Although CSF Tau is available, this measure does not provide a regionally precise measure of Tau accumulation in the MTL, highlighting the importance of adding Tau PET into a study focused on age-related changes in the MTL. Furthermore, the timeframe of this grant is ideal given that the R01 parent study is midway through enrollment, allowing Tau PET to be added during the second half of enrollment, resulting in minimal delay between existing CSF/MRI data and Tau PET (?6 months). Overall, this work will improve fundamental understanding of etiologies underlying age-related changes to the MTL, the impact of MTL Tau on hippocampal mechanisms of memory, and ultimately predictive risk of AD dementia."
"9619136","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to combine two novel technologies in order to improve the capacity of pancreatic islet transplants to cure type 1 diabetes. The first technology involves transplantation of vascularized islets in the form of composite islet-kidneys (IK), which has the capacity to cure both diabetes and renal failure in swine and baboon model as we have recently demonstrated. In this protocol, pancreatic islets obtained after partial pancreatectomy are first transplanted under the autologous kidney capsule to allow for re- vascularization, and then the composite islet-kidney is transplanted in a recipien diabetic animal. Though composite autologous IK technology substantially reduces the extent of graft damage due to immunologic events, there is still considerable islet loss in IK composite due to hypoxia and ischemic loss ultimately requiring a 70% pancreatectomy of the living donor. To improve IK composite survival and significantly reduce the number of donor islets we propose to use the second technology that utilizes theranostic magnetic nanoparticles as carriers for siRNA, which upon accumulation in islet cells could silence genes responsible for islet damage prior to IK creation. In addition to serving as siRNA carriers these theranostic nanoparticles could be used as in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reporters providing information about graft volume longitudinally and non-invasively. We have previously shown the applicability of this technology for improving graft survival in a mouse model of transplantation. In this application we propose to investigate pre-clinical utility of this approach in non-human primates by delivering siRNA-nanoparticle probes targeting genes implicated in apoptosis to islets prior to creating the IK composite. Specifically, we will target caspase 3, caspase 8 and Fas, alone or in combination, as the most important mediators of apoptosis. In vivo MR imaging will be used to monitor autologous IK graft volume followed by continuous imaging of the IK transplant in recipient diabetic animals since magnetic nanoparticles are retained in the islets long term. We expect that by targeting apoptotic genes we will reduce the damage to the islets in autologous IK composite and as a consequence will reduce the number of donor islets required for IK composite to correct hyperglycemia in diabetic recipients. By further minimizing the amount of excised pancreas and non-invasive assessment of islets volume by the MN-siRNA technology, the clinical applicability of this procedure will be more favorable for living donor IK transplantation."
"9440309","Project Summary Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the major public health crisis of our time. Based on the rationale that treatments are more likely to be effective before significant cognitive impairment has accrued, there is increased focus on intervening in preclinical or early prodromal stages. A major challenge for clinical trials in these populations is development of tools to determine if these interventions are effective. As the earliest neurodegenerative changes of AD are thought linked to the development of pathology within the medial temporal lobe (MTL), measures of episodic memory and imaging of this region may play a critical role in serving as a means for disease monitoring. However, ?normal? aging is also associated with both structural and functional alterations of the MTL, and episodic memory is one of the domains most saliently implicated in age-associated cognitive decline. The major goal of this proposal is to identify MTL-related features that distinguish normal aging from preclinical AD, as well as the factors that influence these differences.  In light of structural, functional, and cognitive overlap in normal aging and preclinical AD, a more granular examination is necessary to better distinguish these conditions. Doing so is essential for effective disease monitoring that dissociates age-effects from those of evolving AD. Critically, the MTL consists of a number of inter-related subregions that have been associated with different aspects of memory and may be selectively vulnerable to aging versus preclinical AD. However, despite decades of work focused on the cognitive neuroscience of memory loss with aging, this more granular understanding of specific changes that occur within the MTL and related networks is lacking and the literature conflicting.  We will address a number of methodologic issues with the prior literature that may account for this inconsistency. First, we will leverage our extensive experience in development of methods for MTL structural and functional measurement and take advantage of the improved resolution of 7 Tesla (T) MRI imaging over more standard clinical or research MRI scans. Second, we will obtain amyloid imaging to determine the presence preclinical AD, allowing us to isolate aging effects on its own. Third, we will comprehensively account for other factors that may influence MTL changes, including cerebrovascular disease (CVD), presence of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology independent of preclinical AD, and genetic factors. We will obtain sensitive markers of CVD with 7T MRI, NFT burden with Tau PET imaging, and SNPs associated with AD risk. Fourth, we will examine the cognitive effects of these changes with experimental memory measures.  We anticipate that the detailed understanding of the effect of age on MTL structure and function will allow for definition of monitoring targets of preclinical AD and significantly enhance our understanding of mechanisms underlying age-associated memory decline."
"9574135","The goal of this proposal is to install and integrate the ImageStream®X Mark II Imaging Flow Cytometer system in the Cellular and Molecular Evaluation Core (CMEC) Facility within Research Service at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center. The overarching objective of this core facility is to provide tools and services, including flow cytometry and cell sorting applications, necessary to support and advance research that directly impacts the health of our Veterans. Conventional flow cytometry allows for interrogation of large numbers of cells and quantitative analyses of these populations; however, it does not allow for sub-cellular localization and functional analysis is limited. Conventional microscopy offers morphologic information as well as detailed cellular and subcellular localization data; however, interpretation of microscopic images can be subjective, qualitative, and tedious to quantify. Given the increasing complexity of research questions at both the basic and translational levels, the need for advanced technology that allows for speed, sensitivity, and precision phenotyping and functional analysis is urgent. The ImageStream®X Mark II system represents a first in class, state-of-the-art platform allowing for a powerful combination of multiparametric flow cytometry and imaging, circumventing the limitations of conventional flow cytometry and microscopy to provide a never before available level of speed, sensitivity, quantification, and precision for analysis of animal and patient samples. The ImageStream®X Mark II?s proprietary technology results in superior fluorescence sensitivity for resolution of rare, dim, or small populations and quantitative microscopy for powerful statistical analysis of these populations, allowing for examination of cellular populations, cellular sub-populations, and particles (i.e., exosomes) that simply could not be quantitatively analyzed using standard instrumentation. Our investigators have identified four primary aims that will be accomplished through this groundbreaking technology: 1) Identification of novel cellular sub- populations which contribute to the pathology of disease; 2) Examination of rare events (including stem cells) and small particles (including exosomes) in physiological and pathological conditions; 3) Detection of cellular biomarkers of disease progression and/or clinical response to treatment; and 4) Discovery of novel signaling pathways leading to the development of targeted, personalized, precision therapies. The state-of-the-art technology afforded by the ImageStream®X Mark II Imaging Flow Cytometer System is broadly applicable across the diverse animal- and human-based research efforts of our local VAMC investigators including studies in traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, immunology, oncology, orthopedic injury, Alzheimer?s disease and mental health disorders. Incorporating the ImageStream®X Mark II Imaging Flow Cytometer System into the established CMEC will greatly strengthen the research capabilities of our station, facilitating basic scientific discovery of mechanisms underlying physiological and pathological processes and translation of these findings to support the rapid implementation of cutting-edge personalized medical treatment to improve quality healthcare for our Nation?s Veterans, a specific directive outlined in the Secretary?s Blueprint for Excellence and Secretary Shulkin?s 10-point plan."
"9437764","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this proposal are to define the mechanisms by which alternatively spliced isoforms of the serine- threonine kinase, BRAF, are expressed in the context of melanoma targeted therapies and to elucidate how these isoforms mediate therapy resistance. Approximately 50% of melanoma patients harbor an activating mutation in BRAF, a protein in the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. Recently approved therapies targeting this pathway have increased treatment options for melanoma patients but multiple resistance mechanisms inevitably arise leading to therapy failure. A fuller understanding of these mechanisms of resistance offers the possibility for improved treatment design and identification of additional therapeutic targets. One of the most prevalent resistant mechanisms is the aberrant splicing of BRAF, which has been identified in patients resistant to RAF inhibitor mono therapy, as well as in patients receiving combination RAF and MEK inhibitors. This alternatively spliced protein exhibits enhanced dimerization and downstream ERK1/2 signaling in the presence of RAF inhibitors. Through the successful completion of the following three aims, we will gain an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the expression of BRAF splice variants and the mechanisms by which BRAF splice variants confer resistance. In the first aim, we will elucidate the mechanism by which BRAF is alternatively spliced. RNA-seq analysis of in vivo derived BRAF splice variant expressing melanoma cells revealed altered expression of the SRRM family of splicing-related proteins. We hypothesize that the observed differences in expression of the SRRM protein family contributes to the prevalence of BRAF splice variants. The second aim will identify residues on the BRAF splice variants that are critical for continued ERK1/2 signaling in the presence of RAF inhibitor. All reported BRAF splice variants lack the regulatory Ras binding domain and a single 14-3-3 scaffolding protein binding site. We hypothesize that removal of the S365 14-3-3 binding site and retention of the S729 site promote kinase activity in the presence of RAF inhibitors. Finally, we aim to investigate the role that BRAF splicing plays in mediating resistance to next generation, paradox-breaking BRAF inhibitors. Current RAF inhibitors lead to the paradoxical activation of wild type BRAF in healthy cells. Plexxikon has recently developed a next-generation RAF inhibitor, PLX8394, which selectively targets mutant BRAF but does not elicit deleterious paradoxical responses. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of PLX8394 in vitro; however, the resistance mechanisms against PLX8394 that will arise in vivo remain unstudied. We show that PLX8394 blocks BRAF splice variant dimerization in vitro and thus hypothesize that PLX8394 will block splice variant signaling in an in vivo xenograft model. The data generated in this proposal may implicate specific spliceosome components and protein signaling mechanisms as novel targets for treating patients with RAF inhibitor resistant melanoma."
"9441825","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this work is to rationally manipulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) activation with the hope to develop novel therapeutic approaches in this major family of transmembrane receptors and drug targets. Our hypothesis is that evolutionary patterns of amino acid substitutions can reveal sequence positions that play major roles across GPCRs, individually or together, in order to mediate ligand binding, conformation switching, and finally ligand-biased activation of efferent signaling pathways that can be G protein-dependent or -independent. In the past funding period, computational analysis identified such evolutionary patterns and revealed: allosteric switches that in D2-type dopamine receptors (D2R) rewire signaling from dopamine to serotonin, or, that selectively block downstream G protein-dependent or -independent signaling. We also found other switches that separated ligand binding from receptor signaling in the extracellular domain of metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluR). Technical progress also led to increased accuracy as a result of insuring computational similarity among structural neighbor residues, and for the first time linking our algorithms to a first-principle equation for the evolutionary variations of genotype and phenotype. Together these data and other data support new, twinned biological and algorithmic aims: 1. To redirect ligand binding in bioamine receptors. 2. To redesign ligand binding and dimerization in metabotropic glutamate receptors. 3. To identify the components of the allosteric pathway extending from the ligand binding site to the G protein-coupled interfaces. The outcome should reveal new aspects of the molecular basis of signaling in an important family of pharmaceutical targets. It will also link sequence and structure genomics databases to the molecular basis of function and to the rational re-design of protein interactions-key steps towards manipulating cellular pathways."
"9473976","Project Summary Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease, are major health issues world-wide. The role of glia in neurodegeneration is not well understood, and the role may differ depending on the specific type and stage of disease. A major function of glia during brain homeostasis is the phagocytosis of pruned axons, dead or injured cells, and debris. Several lines of evidence suggest that glial phagocytosis plays an important role in the prevention or progression of brain disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, we investigate the role of phagocytosis in neurodegenerative disorders using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila provides a wealth of genetic and cell biological tools for the study of glial phagocytosis and neurodegeneration. Several human neurodegenerative disorders have been modeled in Drosophila, providing a powerful platform for screening for genetic interactors. Moreover, the genes controlling phagocytosis are largely conserved between flies and mammals. Recently, we have shown that a disruption of the phagocytic receptor Draper in glia leads to persisting neuronal corpses and neurodegeneration in Drosophila. Here we will examine whether persistent corpses or debris in the draper mutant brain lead to neurodegeneration by triggering inflammation. We will additionally determine how loss of Draper interacts with genetic models of Alzheimer's disease, and investigate the role of inflammation in these disease models. Phenotypes will be analyzed by molecular, cellular and behavioral assays. These findings will provide insight into the impact of defective phagocytosis in neurodegenerative disorders."
"9644155","ABSTRACT The increase in obesity worldwide has led to rising health care costs and the number of chronically ill people suffering from obesity-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes. The overarching goal of this research proposal is to better understand brown fat activation and to develop new therapeutic manipulations targeting brown fat to treat metabolic disease such as type 2 diabetes. This work will test the hypothesis that the secreted protein Slit2 is involved in adipose thermogenesis and if administration of the protein could be a safe and effective treatment for diabetes. We have previously utilized unbiased quantitative proteomics to identify novel secreted proteins involved in browning. Using this method, I have identified new mechanisms by which thermogenesis can be activated in adipose tissue. One of the candidates from this approach identified Slit2 as a secreted factor from thermogenic adipocytes. Slit2 had previously been described for its function in brain, and were not believed to be circulating in blood. In addition, I have found a C-terminal cleavage fragment of Slit2, Slit2-C, which has no known peripheral function and acts through an unknown cell-surface receptor. My preliminary data demonstrate that increasing Slit2-C circulating levels in obese, insulin resistant mice improves whole body glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure. These mice show increased oxygen consumption in the brown fat tissue as well as activation of a thermogenic transcriptional program. At least in part, Slit2-C acts through activation of the canonical PKA pathway. In the mentored phase of the award, Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that Slit2 is required for regulating adipose tissue thermogenesis in vivo by performing metabolic characterization of the adipocyte-specific knockout of Slit2. In aim 2 of the mentored phase, I will test the hypothesis that administration of Slit2-C recombinant protein to diabetic rodents will improve diet-induced insulin resistance. Aim 3 will be conducted in the independent phase and will use multiple approaches to determine the functional receptor and signaling pathways for Slit2-C with further potential for clinical translation. I will use a combination of animal physiology and genetics, biochemical protein purification, and mass spectrometry techniques to address the questions in the proposal. If successful, I anticipate that the findings in this proposal has the potential to contribute with new treatments for type-2 diabetes.  My current and long-term career objectives are to identify pathways involved in adipose tissue metabolism and to develop new protein therapeutics that regulates glucose homeostasis and has the possibility to improve diabetes. I have a longstanding interest in studying ligand-receptor interactions, macromolecular uptake and mechanisms of intracellular signaling in tumor development. The findings in this proposal are directly building upon my discovery in my postdoctoral work and would be completed in the defined award period. Therefore, study of secreted factor Slit2-C as a new protein therapy for diabetes is a logical extension of my research. My career trajectory after the mentored phase of the K99 is to become an assistant professor at a leading academic research institute. Dr. Bruce Spiegelman, a well-recognized leader in the field of brown fat and diabetes will mentor my scientific and career development. Dr. Spiegelman has successfully trained numerous postdoctoral fellows now holding faculty positions in academic institutions. The Spiegelman laboratory and Harvard Medical School research community provide an ideal setting for training future independent investigators. My plan for career activities includes a continous progress evaluation with my mentor, training in biochemistry and protein therapies, supervision and leadership training, educational coursework, and mentored job search. These career activities will be imperative in the preparation to establish my own research laboratory. In the independent phase, I plan to leverage my biochemical skills and development of new protein biologics and signaling pathways to scientifically separate myself from my mentor. My long-term scientific goal is to establish myself as an independent researcher to drive the field of metabolism and diabetes forward. My focus will be to study biological pathways of circulating hormones and to further study adrenergic receptor-independent pathways of thermogenesis activation in the context of obesity and diabetes. Together with the outstanding resources at Harvard Medical School, this will maximize my potential to successfully transition to independence. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award will be essential for my transition because it will enable me to gain additional training in mouse models of obesity and protein therapies as well as improving my writing and communication skills required for a successful transition."

"9614134","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to provide investigators a unique rat model system and bioanylates to explore the mechanistic basis of complex diseases. The strong link between low exercise capacity and increased morbidity and mortality suggests that: aerobic energy metabolism is a central mechanistic determinant of the divide between disease and health (Aerobic Hypothesis). As an unbiased test of this hypothesis we applied divergent artificial selection for intrinsic low and high endurance treadmill running capacity starting with  founder population of genetically heterogeneous rats (N/NIH). Selection across 35 generations produced lines of low capacity runners (LCR) and high capacity runners (HCR) that differ by ~8-fold in running capacity. As predicted by the Aerobic Hypothesis, disease risks segregated strongly with low aerobic capacity. The LCR score high on many risks including reduced longevity, metabolic syndrome, and Alzheimer's degeneration. The HCR score high for health factors such as VO2max and resistance to obesity. The LCR-HCR models fulfill the criteria for a P40 grant: A) The rats are valuable for biomedical research, but not generally available. B) There is a demonstrated need as evidenced by >400 publishing investigators, at >60 institutions, and 100 published papers. C) This resource serves the needs of multiple NIH ICs. D) The models and bioanalytes (e.g., DNA and tissues) will be made available widely. E) A high probability plan will move the resource to 100% self-sufficiency. F) A 7-part plan is established to attract high quality users. G) An advisory board will direct improvement. H) Embryo cryopreservation will serve as applied research to improve the resource. G) The resource opens new lines of investigation for understanding disease. Specific Aim 1. Continue selection of the LCR and HCR for generations 36-45 as a source of rats for users and to accumulate more recombination events that will enhance genetic mapping resolution. Specific Aim 2. Systematically establish bioanylate and electronic data resources and make these readily available. Specific Aim 3. Attract users for hypothesis-driven mechanistic study of complex diseases. As examples, we summarize three NIH funded ongoing studies: a) genotype-to-phenotype analysis, b) hepatic steatosis, and c) postoperative cognitive decline. Apparently disparate conditions segregated with selection for aerobic capacity suggesting we may discover new mechanistic commonalities underlying complex diseases."

"9449383","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While BACE1 has emerged as an effective drug target for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD); side effects of BACE1 inhibitors are not well characterized. To identify the neuronal surface proteins most affected by lack of BACE1 inhibition, we recently performed an unbiased screen of surface proteins in adult BACE1-null mouse brain slices. This screen and subsequent cell-based studies revealed those two GPI- anchored adhesion molecules, contactin-1 and -2, highly increased in the BACE1-null brain. Interestingly, contactin-1 is known to regulate the surface expression and localization of Nav1.2 channels while contactin-2 modulates Kv1.1/2 channels. Nav and Kv channels almost exclusively carry out the rising and falling phases of action potentials. Previously, we have also shown that BACE1 activity regulates mRNA, protein, and cell- surface levels of the pore-forming Nav1.1 ?-subunit, a major CNS-specific voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav). Contactin-2 is also known to promote APP processing. In vitro analyses confirmed that BACE1 cleaves both contactin-1 and -2. In primary hippocampal/cortical neurons, we found that either BACE1 inhibitor treatment or overexpression of BACE1 dramatically alter surface levels of contactin-1 and -2. Interestingly, contactin-2 levels decrease by ~50% in AD brains with elevated BACE1. Nav1.2 surface levels are increased in BACE1- null neurons and the surface expression of Kv1.2 channels is dramatically modulated by BACE1 activity in brain slices and primary neurons. Importantly, overexpression of contactin-1 rescues impaired Nav channel ?-subunit channel trafficking in neuroblastoma cells expressing BACE1. Therefore, our new findings suggest that BACE1 regulates Nav1.2 and Kv1.2 channel trafficking by modulating the surface expression of contactin-1 and -2. The overarching goals of this application are to explore how contactin-1 and -2 processing by BACE1 regulates ion channel metabolism and to elucidate non-amyloidogenic functions of BACE1 for developing a safe therapeutic protocol to inhibit BACE1 activity in AD patients. To this end, we propose to use an integrated approach of cell biology and in vivo animal models. We will first identify the BACE1 cleavage sites in contactin- 1 and -2, and characterize the effect of these cleavages on APP metabolism. We will then determine the functional role of BACE1-mediated contactin processing in Nav and Kv channel metabolism. We will also explore the effect of BACE1 inhibitors on non-amyloidogenic BACE1 functions, including contactin-regulated ion channels in adult mouse brains, and in 3D cultures of human neural cells. Collectively, the proposed studies will define how BACE1-mediated processing of contactin-1 and -2 regulates Nav1.2 and Kv1.2 channel metabolism and may also provide novel mechanistic insights on contactin-regulated A? generation. Since imbalance in ion channel function may lead to seizures, the overall goal of these experiments is to provide necessary mechanistic and in vivo data for further development of BACE1 inhibitors as a safe therapeutic strategy for AD."

Rather than focusing on one particular type of immune cell or disease process, the meeting will highlight mechanistic approaches that aim to rigorously advance our knowledge of how the processes of signal transduction and gene regulation operate within the immune system. Ample opportunity is provided for junior scientists to present their results, and also for the presentation of important, late-breaking findings. The meeting format also ensures time for interactions between scientists, particularly during meals and in poster sessions. The meeting will foster interaction among immunologists working in related areas, and provide a forum for the development of new ideas and approaches to immune system signaling and gene expression."
"9591493","Abstract  Despite the substantial declines in HIV transmission and increases in lifespan among those living with HIV achieved over the past decade, full benefits that should be possible based on the tools and interventions currently available have yet to be realized in youth, in large part because efficacious interventions for this age group have not been brought to scale. To be effective, youth must be fully engaged in interventions at every stage of the HIV care (treatment and prevention) cascades: HIV testing, linkage to care, timely initiation of care, persistence and adherence to antiretroviral care. At-risk HIV-negative youth need to be consistently engaged in prevention strategies such as PEP and/or PrEP as indicated, consistent safer sex practices and repeat HIV testing. Our U19 project - Scale It Up - specifically focuses on the process of improving self- management among youth including: 1) the identification of interventions that are efficacious and effective for improving self-management in YLH and at risk youth; 2) the multi-site implementation of an intervention shown to be efficacious in improving self-management; and 3) the assessment of the Five Components of Self- Management Model and how these vary over time, are directly improved by interventions, and mediate intervention effects. Our team has also been at the leading edge of implementation Science research related to HIV prevention and care. We are actively committed to aggressively moving beyond simple efficacy and effectiveness RCTs. The four Research Projects proposed in Scale It Up, all addressing self-management, will continue to develop the field of Implementation Science by employing three types of effectiveness- implementation hybrid designs. The studies further synergize by utilizing Aaron?s Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) model to guide the proposed Implementation Science efforts. Our proposed Implementation Science Core, coupled with the cost effectiveness expertise of our Analytic Core, will be focused on the central notion of ?Scale It Up? ? taking efficacious self-management interventions and expeditiously moving them into practice while sustaining effectiveness. Scale It Up has assembled research teams who will develop, test, and bring to practice self-management interventions that positively impact the youth HIV prevention and care cascades. We will achieve these goals by: 1) Designing, conducting and evaluating self-management interventions grounded in the 5-component Self-Management Model and expeditiously moving effective programs into practice; 2) Developing, deploying and disseminating new methods for implementation and implementation analysis with a strong theoretical foundation; and 3) Engaging with the other funded U19s to identify additional opportunities to advance the implementation science and self- management science."
"9442217","PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this application is to advance novel peptide therapeutics for hypertension with a special focus on resistant hypertension (RH) for which there are no approved drugs or devices in the US. Our strategy is to target the particulate guanylyl cyclase receptor-A/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (pGC- A/cGMP) pathway for which the cardiac hormone ANP is an endogenous ligand. Studies to date support a key role for the pGC-A/cGMP pathway in blood pressure (BP) regulation. The mechanism of BP lowering is natriuresis, vasodilation and aldosterone suppression. Beyond BP lowering properties, this pathway also possesses anti-hypertrophic, anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and endothelial protective actions. In the general population, we and others have reported a genetic variation of the ANP gene (rs5068) is associated with higher ANP, lower BP and protection from hypertension (HTN) and metabolic syndrome. We also reported that early stages of human HTN are characterized by reduced ANP, while severe HTN is characterized by lower ANP and higher aldosterone. Importantly, African Americans (AAs) represent an ethnic population at high risk for RH and are characterized by a 40% reduction in circulating natriuretic peptides (NPs) compared to other ethnic groups. The applicants designed MANP as a best-in-class pGC-A/cGMP activator, which possesses enhanced pGC-A/cGMP activating properties, and is markedly resistant to degradation by neprilysin. In experimental models, MANP is superior in lowering BP, enhancing natriuresis and suppressing aldosterone compared to ANP. In the only human study to date, once daily subcutaneous injection of MANP, for three days, in subjects with RH was well tolerated, safe and robustly reduced BP, suppressed aldosterone and enhanced sodium excretion as well as GFR. First, we propose to define the responsiveness to MANP in African Americans (AAs) with RH. Second, we will define the chronic cardiorenal protective and RAAS suppressing actions of a next generation MANP (i.e. MANP2) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Third, we propose to define synergism in vitro between two lead small molecule positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) with MANP2 to optimize pGC-A activation. Specific Aim 1: Define BP, CV, renal, neurohumoral, and cGMP responses of MANP in AAs with RH using Mayo Clinic's Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCaTS) Clinical Research Unit (CRU). Specific Aim 2: Establish in vivo the chronic cardiorenal protective and RAAS suppressing properties of MANP2 in SHRs compared to Entresto. Specific Aim 3: Define synergy in pGC-A/cGMP activation, in vitro, between two lead PAMs and MANP2 in human primary cells."
"9555294","Project Summary Chronic tendon injury and tendinopathy are extremely common and painful degenerative conditions whose prevalence reaches 30-50% in adults over 60. Most of these people don?t seek surgical treatment, however they do receive injections or physical therapy to improve pain management and regain a small amount of strength. There are no non-surgical tendinopathy therapies that are proven clinically effective, therefore there is an urgent clinical need for the development of novel therapies for this condition. Adult stem cells are characterized by their self-renewing capacity and multipotency making them attractive starting materials for tendon, and ligament tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. However stem cells do not necessarily repair tissue by differentiating into the desired tissue type, but act more in a regulatory role. This is accomplished through paracrine effects and cell-cell interactions which can be carried out via secreted extracellular vesicles, including exosomes. If many of the regenerative properties of stem cells can be credited to exosomes, there will be a paradigm shift in how we view regenerative medicine and therapeutics for many indications: live cell therapies could be replaced with exosome-based biologics. Our focus is to determine the feasibility of using stem cell derived exosomes that have been specifically tuned to break the ineffective repair cycle inherent in tendinopathy. Proteomic and genomic analysis of exosome content has revealed a broad range of signaling factors that are both cell type-specific as well as differentially regulated by the secreting cells? environment. Based on these phenomena, this Phase I program is intended to address two hypotheses: 1) the cargo of stem cell-derived exosomes can be ?tuned? toward pro-healing factors by altering the cells? environment and 2) these pro-healing exosomes can be used as a potential tendon healing/regenerative therapeutic. We have developed a bioreactor-based production system for manufacturing exosomes from various cell types, including stem cells. The bioreactor is an ideal system to test exosome cargo tunability, providing a defined environment and optimized exosome purification capabilities. This Phase 1 project is designed to provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for the further development of this therapeutic approach. We will assess the healing potential of stem cell exosomes derived from two unique tissue sources using our established tenocyte culture system. This information will provide the basis to test the most effective exosomes in a rat tendon healing model. Successful results will lead to further development, mechanistic studies, age- related effects and in vivo efficacy assessments in other tendon healing models leading to our ultimate goal of developing an allogeneic therapy for chronic tendinopathy and acute tendon healing."
"9518261","ABSTRACT Adaptive immune cells in the periphery (T and B cells) and innate immune cells in the brain (microglia) have been implicated in the brain homeostasis in health and disease. Rodent studies using immunodeficient mice have revealed that the loss of adaptive immune cells (T and B cells) led to impaired learning and memory, anxiety-like behaviors, and impaired sociability. Nevertheless, it is not clear how adaptive immune cells communicate with microglia and affect brain development and function. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the communication between adaptive immune cells and brain cells during brain development and in adulthood. Our preliminary studies revealed that Rag1-/- and [Rag2- /-mice], lacking both T and B cells, exhibited impaired social behaviors. In Rag1-/- mice, increased c-Fos expression and altered microglial phenotypes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were observed. This is consistent with previous reports that mPFC dysfunction is involved in social behaviors. [Notably, adoptive transfer of wild-type (WT) splenocytes (containing T and B cells) rescued Rag1-/- social behavioral deficits. Further, injection of WT serum exosomes rescued the same phenotype. The social behavioral deficits were also observed in Rag2-/- mice despite the fact that Rag2 is normally absent in the WT brain. Together, these findings suggest that T and B cells contribute to social behaviors via exosomes.] Indeed, we observed that exosomes from the sera of Rag1-/- mice lacked the expression of T and B cell markers and multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) presumably derived from T and B cells. The expression of predicted target gene(s) of these miRNAs, such as Ski, was enhanced in the PFC of Rag1-/- mice. In contrast, WT serum exosomes decreased Ski expression in microglia. Recent studies showed that microglia control neuronal synapses. Thus, our data suggest that deficient adaptive immune cell-microglia communication via exosomes impairs social behaviors by altering mPFC function. Hence, in this study, we will test our hypothesis that the lack of adaptive immune cell-derived exosomes and their miRNAs results in impaired social behaviors via altered microglial control of neuronal function in the medial PFC. We will first validate and extend our findings on serum exosomes and the mPFC neurons in Rag1-/- mice, and determine the causal role for the lack of adaptive immune cells by restoring them back into Rag1-/- mice with adoptive transfer technique (Aim 1). We will also examine the direct impact of impaired exosome release and miRNA production in adaptive immune cells on microglia and neurons in the mPFC and social behaviors by genetic approaches (Aim 2). [In addition, we will address the contribution of pyramidal neurons and microglia in the mPFC to impaired social behaviors (Aim 3).] This study will reveal novel mechanisms whereby adaptive immune cell-derived exosomes influence brain function and behavior and may eventually lead to novel therapeutic strategies in psychiatric disorders."

"9452004","Filoviruses and arenaviruses are two major families of lethal hemorrhagic fever viruses for which no vaccines or treatments are currently available. Previous work by several investigators involved in this proposal has unequivocally demonstrated the feasibility of protecting non-human primates against viral challenge with immunotherapy. This highly translational proposal will identify the most effective monoclonal antibodies and from them, create broad-spectrum antibody cocktails for pre- or post-exposure use. To achieve this goal, we will leverage the consortium's large collection of anti-filovirus and anti-arenavirus antibodies, as well as new antibodies to be derived from ongoing and proposed discovery efforts. However, it will not be feasible to test each of our hundreds of candidate antibodies and thousands of potential antibody combinations in animals without some initial in vitro downselection. To generate a manageable set of candidate antibodies and cocktails, Core C (working together the three project teams and the Gore D team) will categorize antibodies into structural and functional groups, perform rules-based triage of antibody candidates, and design antibody cocktails based on antiviral activity and functional diversity. Finally and importantly. Core C will prioritize candidate cocktails based on their susceptibility to escape mutations, and will, together with Core D, identify antibodies most resistant to escape, as well as replacement antibodies that will mop up escaping virions. In addition to selection of the most effective single antibodies and cocktails of antibodies to forward for patient use, this Gore will provide essential information that addresses major, basic knowledge gaps in the field. Our comprehensive analysis will illustrate which epitopes lead to the most effective protection, which in vitro assays are the best predictors of in vivo efficacy, and which epitopes lead to broad-spectrum reactivity and protection."
"9525619","Project Summary The worker response to the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks was unprecedented in scope, involving tens of thousands of traditional (e.g., police) and non-traditional (e.g., construction workers) responders. While posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) arising in response to the WTC attacks is prevalent and chronic in 14% of WTC responders, a substantial proportion of this population has remained psychologically resilient to WTC-related PTSD and related symptoms, even more than 15 years after 9/11. Psychological resilience is defined as the ability of an individual to adapt successfully to severe stress, trauma or adversity. The proposed study aims to fill a major gap in our understanding of the neurobiology of psychological resilience by using state-of-the-art functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods to characterize between-group functional differences in neural circuits underlying three of the most widely replicated psychological domains ?and potentially modifiable protective factors? associated with resilience: (1) emotion regulation (emotion processing neural circuits), (2) positive emotions (reward processing neural circuits), and (3) the ability to establish and nurture a supportive social network (social cognition neural circuits) in a diverse sample of 105 WTC responders. Characterization of the function of these neural circuits in resilient individuals is critical to understanding the etiology of psychological resilience, as well as to informing resilience-promoting prevention and treatment efforts. WTC responders will be recruited into three groups: highly resilient WTC responders, who have remained psychologically resilient despite enduring severe WTC-related exposures (n=35), and two comparison groups of WTC responders: (1) a symptomatic group with chronic, clinically significant PTSD symptoms (n=35), and (2) a low WTC-exposed control group without psychiatric disorder, who experienced significantly lower levels of WTC-related exposures (n=35). WTC responders will be recruited from a large responder cohort followed prospectively at the WTC Health Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and who have participated in an ongoing study of genomic and neuroendocrine biomarkers of psychological risk and resilience (#3U01OH010407-01S1). The ultimate goal of this study is to develop an integrative, data-driven model to examine how patterns of brain activation across functional domains give rise to distinct mechanisms underlying resilience, and how these neural mechanisms interrelate with behavioral (e.g., emotion regulation, reward responses, social cognition) and psychosocial (e.g., coping self-efficacy, positive emotions, social connectedness) factors implicated in resilience. Results of this study will be used to inform personalized and targeted prevention and treatment approaches that bolster function of specific neural circuits and help promote psychological resilience in WTC and other disaster responders, as well as other populations of trauma survivors."
"9383344","Summary This application proposes advances to precision medicine along three complementary arcs, building on our initial work in RO1-MH099003 (Characterizing Placebo Response to Active Treatment Using Very High-Dimension- al Data). A primary component of precision medicine involves determining optimal treatment decisions using baseline variables. We have previously developed statistical models that can accommodate both scalar and functional predictors in determining treatment decision functions. This renewal application addresses the fact that available data modalities continue to evolve and grow ever more complex. Determining treatment deci- sions is closely related to the problem of quantifying the degree to which individual outcomes are due to spe- cific drug effects versus placebo responses. We propose to develop completely nonparametric distance-based approaches with the goal of determining optimal treatment decisions and generalizing these to accommodate multiple data modalities. Because no single biomarker for response to treatment has been identified, methods to form composite biomarkers by combining predictors will be developed to incorporate data arising from com- plex modalities. Many brain-related measures are expensive and time consuming to collect, and thus a vital component of optimizing treatment decisions is to develop a sequential treatment decision strategy whereby easy-to-make measurements are obtained first, and the more expensive and time consuming measurements are only obtained if they are needed to improve confidence in a treatment decision.  A complementary arc of the proposed research involves stratified psychiatry and developing directed partitioning/clustering methods to improve precision medicine. This is not only important to the work on deter- mining optimal treatment decisions, but also towards a data-driven discovery of psychiatric biotypes. Optimizing treatment decisions is naturally related to the thorny problem of making a clear diagnosis, especially in mental health where there is a wide degree of heterogeneity and overlap in current disease phenotypes. This research aims to expand the notion of endophenotypes from genetics to data modalities based on brain structure, func- tion, and integrity. Specific to this application, the notion of endophenotypes will be expanded to discover more stable phenotypes using biomedical technologies, that those obtained based on symptoms.  The Establishing Moderators & Biosignatures for Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC; U01MH092221, U01MH092250 ) study, which is the most ambitious systematic effort to discover biomarkers to guide treatment of major depressive disorder, has collected and made publicly available an unprecedented collection of clinical and biological patient phenotypes. This is a proposal to develop analytic methodology that would be able to take full advantage of rich and complex patient data as those in the EMBARC study for the purposes of precision medicine, in an anticipation of future similar or even more ambitious studies."
"9474153","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of frail, elderly, and chronically ill patients lose functional capacity during hospitalization. The result is an unnecessarily increased risk of falls, near-term rehospitalizations, and discharges to institutional rather than home settings. Our current clinical care model systemically engenders these often avoidable losses of function due to its unnecessary and ineffective reliance on busy clinicians to detect functional decline and initiate simple, yet effective, treatment plans. There is a critical need to reconceptualize this situation by: 1) minimizing reliance on overburdened clinicians to detect, address, and monitor patients' rehabilitation needs; and 2) immediately initiating resource-appropriate individualized care plans. A non-burdensome assessment strategy capable of accurately profiling patients' evolving functional capabilities and rehabilitation needs is needed. However, no measure currently offers this capability. We propose to develop and evaluate the needed assessment tool by refining the extant item response theory (IRT)-modeled Activity Measure for Post Acute Care (AM-PAC) item banks to create a disease-independent multidimensional computerized adaptive test (MCAT). In addition to enhanced efficiency and precision, MCAT may definitively address threats to measurement validity that arise when an item's or an IRT model's psychometric properties differ across clinically relevant subgroups (as has been reported for the aged, the intensely symptomatic, and ethnic minorities). The benefits of these achievable efforts will be enormous given that the use of this multidimensional approach will radically enhance assessment scope and efficiency without a commensurate increase in clinician burden in a manner that can be easily integrated into current care practices. More specifically, our approach will be to enrich the current AM-PAC banks and administer them to 1500 hospitalized patients. These data, combined with existing AM-PAC data sets, will be used to evaluate differential item functioning, item density across relevant trait ranges, multidimensional IRT model fit, and cut points for score stratification to match physical therapist (PT)-assigned functional stages. The resultant parameter estimates will be used to create a fixed-length short form (SF) and MCAT specified to assign patients to functional stages that link to validated care plans, as well as to detect meaningful change. We will administer the MCAT and SF to 600 hospitalized patients and 300 proxies, 50% verbally and 50% via tablets, who will concurrently be evaluated by experienced PTs. The resultant data will be used to evaluate the MCAT's and SF's validity relative to the gold standard criterion of PT assessment, association with clinical outcomes, robustness to proxy (i.e., caregiver vs. patient) and mode effects, and responsiveness."

"9440315","ABSTRACT Success requires focus and the ability to screen out distractions. This is especially important in arousing situations: When avoiding imminent danger, tackling a cognitive challenge or trying to achieve a desired goal, focusing on what has highest priority or is most salient is often helpful. We plan to test the hypothesis that when arousing or challenging situations activate the locus coeruleus (LC) in healthy younger adults, it enhances processing high priority or highly salient items but impairs processing of less active competing representations. The framework behind this hypothesis is the first to explain how arousal both enhances and impairs attention and memory and this project will be the first to systematically examine the relationship between LC structural decline and cognitive function in normal aging and in Alzheimer's disease. We predict that, in older adults, the LC has a less targeted effect than it does in younger adults, meaning that arousal still has a significant impact on older adults' cognitive processing but that it is less likely to increase the selectivity of their attention or the specificity of their memories. Furthermore, we predict that in Alzheimer's disease, declines in structural connectivity will be extensive enough to impair both the excitatory and inhibitory effects of LC activity. This work to understand the role of the LC in cognitive function becomes particularly urgent in light of recent striking findings indicating that the LC is the first place in the brain that sporadic (or late-onset) Alzheimer's related tau pathology emerges, and that by young adulthood, most people have at least some tau pathology in the LC. Here we use neuromelanin-weighted structural MRI images and diffusion tensor imaging structural connectivity measures to examine how LC integrity relates to function on a variety of tasks that assess cognitive selectivity. We will test healthy older adults, older adults with late-onset Alzheimer's and younger and middle-aged adults with genetic subtypes of Alzheimer's disease (due to mutations in the PSEN1 and APP genes) that lead to early onset of the disease."
"9658022","Project Summary  The dramatic improvement in data collection and acquisition technologies in the past decades has enabled sci- entists to collect vast amounts of health-related data from biomedical studies. If analyzed properly, these data will expand our knowledge for testing new hypotheses about disease management from diagnosis to prevention to per- sonalized treatment. However, the biomedical data can be rather complex, how to analyze them has posed many challenges on the existing methods. This proposal attempts to address three fundamental challenges: (i) Missing data are ubiquitous in biomedical research, how to make a su?cient use of biomedical complex data in presence of missing values? (ii) With the growing data size, typically comes a growing complexity of the patterns in the data and of the models needed to account for the patterns. What is the general recipe for estimating parameters of complex models? (iii) Biomarker identi cation from high-throughput omics data has been one of major focuses in cancer research. Yet despite intense e?ort, the number of biomarkers approved by FDA each year for clinical use is still in single digits. An important factor contributing to this failure is the lack of appropriate statistical methods for analyzing such heterogeneous and high-dimensional data. Toward a su?cient use of biomedical complex data, this project proposes an imputation-consistency algorithm as a general algorithm for high-dimensional missing data problems. Then the algorithm is extended to address other two challenges under the principles of conditioning and consistency; in particular, this project proposes some highly e?cient and e?ective statistical algorithms that address the heterogeneity and high-dimensionality issues encountered in biomarker identi cations and eQTL analysis. The proposed algorithms are applied to (i) select anticancer drug sensitive genes with the CCLE and SANGER data, (ii) identify prognostic mRNA biomarkers for multiple types of cancers using the TCGA data, (iii) conduct eQTL analysis for multiple types of cancers using the TCGA data, and (iv) identify informative circulating biomarkers for type 1 diabetes. The proposed methods are highly e?cient and general and can be applied to other types of disease as well. Statistically, this project is to develop some general, e?ective, and highly e?cient algorithms for complex data analysis; biomedically, this project will signi cantly improve accuracy of biomarker identi cation from omics data, which advances people's understanding of molecular mechanism and development of precision medicine. 1"
"9416613","Project Summary/Abstract: Role of E3 Ligase, UBR5, in Hematopoietic Differentiation and Lymphomagenesis Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Unfortunately, limited therapies for MCL are currently available suggesting a need to further unravel molecular mechanisms regulating transformation and progression of the disease. The majority of MCL patients have mutations leading to overexpression of Cyclin D1 in the pre-B cell population, resulting in extensive proliferation and blocks in differentiation originating in the mantle zone of the lymph node. Recently, next generation sequencing has identified a number of novel mutations in MCL patients including the ubiquitin E3 ligase UBR5. E3 ubiquitin ligases serve as the substrate recognizing component for protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Approximately 18% of MCL patients were found to have mutations within the HECT domain of UBR5, which can accept and transfer ubiquitin molecules to the substrate. Interestingly, in hematopoietic lineages the B-lymphoid populations including the pre-B cell compartment, highly express UBR5 compared to the myeloid and T-lymphoid compartments. These findings suggest that understanding the role and interacting proteins of UBR5 in hematopoiesis will provide insights to mantle cell lymphoma transformation, progression and possible future therapeutics targets, in addition to basic understanding of hematopoietic cell specification."
"9437847","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year in the United States, approximately 1 million patients receive life-sustaining mechanical ventilation (MV) in the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure. The financial burden of critical illness ranges from $121-$263B/year which is comparable to annual cancer care costs. To reduce anxiety, stress and promote tolerance of MV, nurses frequently administer a variety of sedative medications to patients based on subjective observations of arousal and motor activity. While sedation is indicated at times, it can have serious side effects including delayed weaning, mental status changes, delirium, prolonged MV, and extended ICU stay. Symptom management strategies are needed that do not cause serious side effects, are safe and alleviate distressful MV-induced symptoms such as anxiety. Self-management of sedative therapy (SMST) by mechanically ventilated patients (MVPs) may be one such novel strategy. This RCT aims to: 1) Determine the efficacy of SMST compared to nurse-administered sedative therapy (NAST) on anxiety, duration of mechanical ventilation, and delirium in MVPs; 2) Examine level of arousal, alertness and sedative exposure in MVPs randomized to SMST compared to those MVPs receiving NAST; and, 3) Explore post-ICU outcomes between MVPs randomized to SMST compared to those receiving NAST. A sample of 190 adult MVPs will be recruited from the medical and surgical ICUs at The Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus, OH. Patients will be randomly allocated to SMST with dexmedetomidine (Precedex(r)) or usual care of NAST. Assessments three times each day for up to 7 days include: anxiety (visual analog scale), arousal and alertness (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS)), delirium presence or absence (Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM- ICU)), and all sedative medications. Post-ICU outcomes at 3- and 6-months will be assessed by telephone interview on: physical & functional status (Katz Activities of Daily Living, Functional Activities Questionnaire), psychological well-being (Patient Health Questionnaire, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklists), and health- related quality of life (Short Form-36). Data analyses will include graphing, descriptive statistic, multi-level mixed models, and generalized estimating equations. The goal of this RCT is to demonstrate efficacy of SMST by MVPs to inform a future pragmatic effectiveness trial in day-to-day ICU practice. This new R01 is aligned with two NINR priorities: 1) promoting self-management across acute and chronic conditions, and 2) advancing the science of symptom management. While self-management is usually reserved for community-dwelling persons with chronic conditions, we will apply self-management science in a new population: critically ill MVPs. SMST advances symptom science by empowering MVPs to self-manage anxiety rather than relying on bedside ICU nurses to palliate this burdensome, highly individual symptom. This study contributes to the long- term goals of our research which are to empower MVPs to self-manage their symptoms in order to reduce ICU- acquired complications and promote post-ICU quality of life in this large patient population."
"9508221","Project Summary Aging skeletal muscle undergoes chronic denervation, which leads to decreased muscle mass and function in older adults. The neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the key structure that connects motor neuron nerves with muscle cells, shows increased defects with aging, and is a main contributor to chronic muscle denervation with aging. Evidence from various species indicates that with aging, NMJs from type II fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers show more structural and functional deterioration than type I slow-twitch fibers. But how this process is regulated is largely unknown. A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating skeletal muscle type II fiber-type specific NMJ deterioration with aging could be critical to identifying novel treatments. Caspases, especially caspase-3 and caspase -9, are found at NMJ in various muscle diseases with endplate myopathies, where they lead to either subsynaptic nuclear apoptosis or the NMJ terminal Schwann cells apoptosis. Caspase-3 also plays a critical role in modulating the formation of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor clusters during early development of skeletal muscle, adding another non-apoptotic role of caspase in synapse refinement in the skeletal muscle. However, here the role of these caspases at the NMJ in aging skeletal muscle is still unknown. Our preliminary data revealed that caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity and intensity at NMJ increase with aging, mainly in fast-twitch skeletal muscles of C57/BL6 mice. In addition, the enrichment of these active caspases at NMJ coincides with enrichment of protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunits RII (PKA-RII? and PKA-RII?), protein kinase C subtypes (PKC? and PKC?), and cardiac troponin T (cTnT). Findings from our lab and others show that a) cTnT may regulate PKA, PKC intensity at NMJ, and b) both PKA and PKC regulate caspase activity. Added to this evidence, our new preliminary data strongly indicate a potential role for cTnT-PKA/PKC-caspase signaling at NMJ in aging fast skeletal muscle fibers. To extend these findings, we propose the current project, led by a New Investigator with a well-established team of co- investigators. Thus, the goals of this exploratory R21 project are to: (1) Determine whether enrichment of active caspase-3 and caspase-9 at the NMJ is aging dependent and specific to fast skeletal muscle fibers; (2) Determine the effects of caspase activation and inhibition on skeletal muscle NMJ structure and function; and (3) Determine whether cTnT-PKA/PKC signaling regulates caspase activation at NMJ. Our substantive preliminary data suggest that the proposed study, if successful, could establish proof-of-principle for a novel role for cTnT-PKA/PKC-caspase signaling in regulating NMJ structure and function. These data could suggest useful targets for future prevention and therapy of age-related decline in muscle function."
"9660685","President Barack Obama was delivering on a promise made in his State of the Union Address when he  officially launched the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), igniting intensive work by Dr. Francis Collins and the PMI Working Group this year. The promise is bold: nothing less than truly revolutionizing the way we develop therapies and treatments for patients across America. With the PMI, we can credibly claim that we will improve health outcomes for all.  Achieving this vision will require the efforts of numerous healthcare stakeholders. Because the PMI has the promise to solve our most intractable health problems by harnessing the power of data, success requires recruiting individuals willing to share their personal information. These volunteers ? the 1 million Americans who will comprise the PMI Cohort Program (PMI-CP) ? are the pillars upon which the PMI will stand. The volunteers will need to understand the goals of the PMI, the logistics of what volunteering means and the specifics of why sharing their personal health data and biospecimens will benefit the health of future generations. With the right communications strategy, cohort volunteers will not only understand their individual importance to this cause, they will also be actively enthusiastic, and assist in the recruitment of additional volunteers from their communities.  This is a proposal to help accomplish this feat through a multi- faceted campaign with a suite of outreach strategies designed to find, educate, and activate a cohort that is representative of the diversity of our country. It will require communications strategies that reach many thousands at a time, as well as multiple targeted, personalized micro-strategies. Messaging is at the core of achieving buy-in and making participation a matter of personal, community, and civic pride. As bold and large as the PMI is, recruiting the cohort comes down to the individual.  Garnering this level of buy-in will require a team with expertise in not only communications and patient advocacy, but also with a record of achieving the level of trust needed to connect with individuals in a meaningful way and the ability to motivate them to take action. The team must have the ability to speak across cultures, ethnicities, and socio-economic statuses. We have assembled that team. And we would be honored to make the PMI vision a reality."
"9447096","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):In line with the stated goals of PA-14-047, midcareer investigator award in patient oriented research (parent K24), the goals of this application are to allow me to devote more time to augment my capabilities in Patient- Oriented Research (POR), with a focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers for use in AD risk factor and prevention research, and to provide mentoring to junior clinical investigators in the conduct of POR, with a focus on research in AD risk factors and prevention. Many studies have shown associations of diabetes with AD. However, whether diabetes causes AD neuropathology remains unclear. In order to answer this question I will begin a new R01 award (Diabetes Status and Brain Amyloid in Middle Aged Hispanics; 1R01AG050440- 01A1; 09/01/15-08/31/20) that will be funded shortly after the submission of this K24 application. This 5-year R01 project will conduct Amyloid ? (A?) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 18F-Florbetaben in 150 late middle-aged persons in order to examine in-vivo the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of diabetes status and glycemia with AD. I propose to complement the new R01 by adding plasma-based biomarkers, lipidomics, and by piloting Tau imaging to further the study of mechanisms linking diabetes to AD. The new R01 and the proposed K24 research project will be integrated with the proposed mentoring and raining program. The primary research aim of this award is to examine the association of soluble receptor of advanced glycosylation end-product (sRAGE) with plasma and brain cortical fibrillar Amyloid ? (A?). I will also examine whether these associations mediate the association of glycemia (examined continuously with HbA1c) and diabetes status (Normal glucose tolerance [NGT], pre-diabetes, diabetes), with brain A?. The secondary research aims are to explore the plasma lipidomic profile predictive of brain A? and whether this profile mediates the association of glycemia and diabetes status with brain A?, and to conduct a pilot study of tau imaging using 18F-THK-5351 PET comparing persons with NGT (n=5) and diabetes (n=5) to demonstrate feasibility in preparation for an independent grant application. The mentoring aims of the application are: 1) To train early investigators on POR in the cognitive complications of diabetes and related conditions, the potential mechanisms linking these conditions to AD, and methods to study these associations; 2) Mentees will have access to the training resources of the applicant related to lipidomics; 3) Early investigators will learn about the importance of tau as an AD mechanism, methods to ascertain it, and will have access to the training resources of the application. The training aims of the application are: 1) To trainin the potential application of blood based AD biomarkers to research in AD risk factors and prevention, with an initial focus on diabetes and related conditions; 2) To acquire new knowledge in lipidomics and how it can be applied to the study of risk factors for AD and its prevention and treatment (I will also seek training in genomics and proteonomics); 3) to learn the application of Tau imaging to research in risk factors for AD."
"9668356","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S., teen unintended pregnancy and STIs remain at epidemic levels. Rates of teen fatherhood are especially high among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic teens. Initiatives to prevent teen pregnancy have focused primarily on female adolescents; how to effectively counsel young men to reduce their risk of fathering a teen pregnancy is unclear. We proposed to adapt, implement and rigorously evaluate an innovative computer-assisted motivational interviewing (CAMI) intervention, originally designed and implemented with girls, for use with young men, age 15-24 years old, to reduce their risk of fathering a teen pregnancy. We will use qualitative methods to modify the CAMI for use with young men. Then we will enroll 646 young men, ages 15 to 24 years, from 2 inner city high schools, a young men's clinic and from community agencies and randomize them to either a modified CAMI aimed at Teen Pregnancy Prevention (CAMI-TPP) or a CAMI aimed at diet, physical activity and tobacco use (CAMI- Fitness). The CAMI-TPP group will receive four, 30-minute MI coaching sessions over 12 weeks and one 30 minute booster at 6-months with a MI coach; sessions will be guided by a computer- generated, feedback aimed at increasing condom use, supporting female partners' contraceptive use, and completing a reproductive health visit with STI testing. The CAMI-Fitness group will receive four, 30-minute MI coaching sessions over 12 weeks and one 30 minute booster at 6-months with a MI coach; sessions will be guided by a computer-generated, feedback aimed at diet, physical activity and tobacco use. Both interventions are identical in length and timing but vary in the target behavior (pregnancy prevention versus fitness). We will track the two groups of young men through a 12 week intervention phase and a 12-month follow-up phase to assess differences in sexual and contraceptive behaviors by group. The specific aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the CAMI-TPP compared to CAMI-Fitness in reducing sexual behaviors that increase the risks of fathering an unintended teen pregnancy by increasing condom use and female partner use of moderately and highly effective reversible contraception. We hypothesize that the CAMI-TPP will increase the proportion of participants who report condom use at last intercourse as well as female partner use of contraception. We also predict that those who receive CAMI-TPP will report higher completion of a reproductive health service visit with STI and/or HIV testing over the course of study participation compared to those in the CAMI-Fitness group. If proven effective, the CAMI-TPP could be broadly implemented as a method to decrease the risk of young men fathering a teen pregnancy."
"9633331","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract  X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common form of inheritable rickets, characterized by elevated FGF23 levels leading to low serum phosphate and impaired production of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). Mutations in the endopeptidase PHEX are responsible for the XLH phenotype. While it is known that increases in FGF23 result from PHEX mutations, the molecular basis for this remains unknown. Pathologic mineralization of the enthesis (tendon-bone attachment site), referred to as enthesopathy, is a complication of XLH. Common sites of involvement include the Achilles and patellar entheses. Although it causes significant morbidity in patients, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the enthesopathy and impact of currently available modalities of treatment on the development of enthesopathy are poorly understood. Murine models of hypophosphatemia, including the vitamin D receptor knockout (VDR KO) and the renal type II sodium dependent phosphate co-transporter (Npt2a) KO do not have enthesopathy. In contrast, mice with hypophosphatemia and elevated serum FGF23 levels, including the Hyp mouse (murine model of XLH) and the dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) KO, do develop enthesopathy, suggesting FGF23 and not serum phosphate could have a pathogenic role in enthesopathy development. However, VDR KO mice do not develop rickets until 3 weeks of age, while the rickets in Npt2aKO mice reverses by 4 weeks due to increased 1,25(OH)2D levels. Since both the Hyp and DMP1 KO mice have progressive rickets from birth, the impaired skeletal mineralization may alter mechanical forces in the maturing enthesis, contributing to the development of enthesopathy in XLH and DMP1 inactivation.  The studies proposed are focused on elucidating the molecular and cellular basis for this enthesopathy in a murine model of XLH (Hyp mice). Investigations proposed in Aim I will provide a molecular characterization of the abnormal cells in the entheses of Hyp mice and identify signaling pathways implicated in the development of enthesopathy. The lineage tracing studies in Aim II will identify the origin of these cells in the Hyp enthesis and the pathophysiologic basis for their aberrant differentiation. The studies proposed in Aim III will identify the relative contributions of FGF23, impaired mineralization and mechanical strain on enthesopathy development and progression. The molecular pathophysiology underlying this aberrant mineralization will also provide insight into enthesis abnormalities associated with other musculoskeletal disorders. Prior studies have focused on embryonic tendon development, thus these experiments will contribute to our understanding of normal post-natal enthesis maturation.  The PI, Dr. Liu, is a physician-scientist whose long-term goal is to lead an independent basic science laboratory with a focus on musculoskeletal biology. She developed a strong interest in rare bone diseases while examining the effect of calcitonin on serum FGF23 levels in patients with XLH. She designed, executed and performed analyses for this study, which led to a first author publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. This study combined with her rigorous training in clinical endocrinology allowed Dr. Liu to recognize how clinical experiences can inform her research hypotheses. Her passion for studying the molecular pathophysiology underlying XLH led her to join the laboratory of Dr. Marie Demay, a senior investigator in skeletal biology. Dr. Liu was awarded a F32/NRSA grant to investigate how different treatment modalities, including daily 1,25(OH)2D and FGF23 blocking antibody, affect growth, mineral ion homeostasis, chondrocyte differentiation, and skeletal mineralization. A K08 award will allow Dr. Liu to take advantage of the rich mentorship available in the Harvard skeletal biology community. Her co-mentor Dr. Vicki Rosen, advisory committee, and collaborators, all renowned investigators in musculoskeletal biology, will provide her with valuable advice on experimental design and analyses, as well as career guidance. The career plan, consisting of regular meetings with mentors, course work, didactic conferences, research seminars and journal clubs is designed to enhance her research experience. Dr. Liu will develop expertise in the design, execution and interpretation of studies aimed at dissecting complex skeletal phenotypes at the molecular and cellular levels. She will refine her grant and manuscript writing skills and immerse herself in the field of skeletal and tendon biology. The carefully designed career development plan, combined with a rigorous laboratory experience will provide her with the skills necessary for her to establish her independent research program in an academic institution."
"9377479","Abstract Attentional control refers to an individual's ability to selectively attend to behaviorally relevant stimuli and ignore behaviorally irrelevant stimuli. There are at least two separable components to attentional control, shifting and monitoring, which are each driven by different neural networks in the mammalian prefrontal cortex. During normative aging, both the shifting and monitoring components of attention are impaired in humans, and these alterations negatively impact life quality since the execution of many basic skills is dependent on these mental processes. The neural network level changes that lead to impaired attentional control are poorly understood. This is in part due to the current lack of animal models that can provide neural data with superior spatial and temporal resolution to clarify the functional imaging and EEG data available in humans. Recently, our laboratory has shown that aged macaque monkeys experience performance deficits on tasks requiring attentional control in a manner similar to that which is noted in older humans. The experiments proposed here test the hypothesis that networks of inhibitory neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of macaques are altered during normative aging to give rise to declines in attentional control. Chronic extracellular tetrode recording devices and novel behavioral paradigms will be used to track covariation in behavior and underlying neural responses in the non-human primate. The results from these studies have the potential to identify specific cellular components impacted by aging that give rise to declines in attentional control, a hallmark of cognitive aging in humans."
"9557460","TITLE: Popular Opinion Leaders as a Sports Concussion Prevention Strategy in Middle Schools FOA: RFA-CE-17-002, Development and Evaluation of Sports Concussion Prevention Strategies PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Prevention of concussion is a key priority in the safety of young athletes participating in sport. Accordingly, a major focus over the past decade has been increasing the knowledge and awareness of concussion signs, symptoms, and management strategies. However, few studies have addressed primary and secondary prevention in the youth sport, particularly the middle school sport setting. Research is needed to develop and understand the most effective strategies for concussion prevention and management in this young population. Additionally, these strategies and interventions should be feasible and sustainable. We will address these research needs by developing and piloting a new intervention utilizing a Popular Opinion Leader (POL) model to prevent concussions in middle school sports. The study will include a diverse group of middle school sports teams from two school districts. Five youth sports with a high incidence of concussion and diverse participants (football, boys? soccer, girls? soccer, boys? basketball, and girls? basketball) will be studied. The project has three key aims. First, using formative methods, we will identify the institutional (Aim 1.1), team (Aim 1.2), peer (Aim 1.3) and personal (Aim 1.4) facilitators and barriers to adopting and implementing a POL concussion intervention in middle school football, basketball, and soccer sports communities. Second, we will determine the effect of a POL intervention on concussion-related behavioral and environmental determinants, including attitudes, beliefs, intentions, perceived control, and normative perceptions, among parents (Aim 2.1), coaches (Aim 2.2), and student-athletes (Aim 2.3) participating in middle school football, basketball, and soccer. Third, we will determine the effect of a POL intervention on concussion risk and clinical management, through decreased head impact frequency (Aim 3.1), increased reporting of suspected concussions (Aim 3.2), changes in concussion incidence (Aim 3.3), and improved management of confirmed concussions (Aim 3.4) among middle school student-athletes participating in football, basketball, and soccer. This study will significantly advance our scientific knowledge on the impact of a local concussion prevention programs on knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and health outcomes in youth sports."
"9544508","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Organs- and Tissues-on-Chips, organized by Drs. Christopher P. Austin, Danilo Tagle, Christine L. Mummery and Brian R. Berridge. The conference will be held April 8-12, 2018 at Big Sky Resort, Big Sky, Montana USA. More than 30% of promising medications have failed in human clinical trials because they are found to be toxic despite promising pre-clinical studies in two dimensional cell culture and animal models. Another 60% fail due to lack of efficacy. Consequently, although several thousand diseases affect the human population, only about 500 have approved treatments. However, due to the growing understanding of human biology along with increased availability of innovative technologies, there is now an unprecedented opportunity to translate scientific discoveries more efficiently into new, more effective and safer health interventions. Organs- or Tissues-on-Chips are innovative, alternative approaches that would enable early indications and potentially more reliable readouts of toxicity and efficacy. These microfabricated devices recapitulate the multicellular architectures, tissue-tissue interfaces, physicochemical microenvironments, vascular perfusion and innervation, producing in essence microphysiological systems that mimic human tissue and organ functionality in ways that cannot be recapitulated with conventional culture systems. Through innovative biosensing and readout approaches, these devices employ high-resolution, real-time imaging and non-invasive analysis of biochemical, genetic and metabolic activities of living cells in a functional tissue and organ context. This technology has great potential to advance the study of tissue development, organ physiology and disease etiology. In the context of drug discovery and development, it should be especially valuable for the study of molecular mechanisms of action, prioritization of lead candidates, toxicity testing and biomarker identification. These microfabricated devices have also proven to be useful for modeling human diseases. This conference will touch on ongoing efforts and various applications of tissue-on-chips technology to studies in precision medicine, environmental exposures, reproduction and development, cancer and for use at the International Space Station."

"9558669","SUMMARY Sustained release of drugs delivered onto mucosal surfaces by oral, topical or inhaled routes can be a highly effective means of improving topical bioavailability. Prolongation of epithelial residence time is especially relevant to anti-infective therapies in diseases characterized by chronic infection and inflammation where treatment needs to be both locally potent and systemically safe. Inhaled antibiotics have been used to treat chronic airway infections and have transformed the management of cystic fibrosis (CF), an inherited disease of thickened, abnormally viscoelastic and poorly transported airway mucus leading to persistent lung infection, which affects approximately 30,000 patients in the US and 80,000 world-wide. Despite these benefits, dose- limiting and potentially toxic serum concentrations are an inherent risk of bolus inhalation delivery, especially for drugs with systemic bioavailability. In order to address this we have developed a novel therapeutic solution based on conjugation of inhaled drugs to a natural airway protein modified to have strong mucus-binding properties. C35STrx, a monocysteinic active-site variant of thioredoxin-1 (Trx) remains bound covalently to soluble and tethered airway mucus for many hours, and does not induce inflammation, irritation, or adverse reactions. In preliminary studies the C35STrx scaffold could be conjugated to over ten individual linkers (each of which can be attached modularly to one drug molecule) without loss of target-binding activity. With typical mucus clearance times of 20-24 hours such mucus-bound C35STrx-drug conjugates are anticipated to persist on the airway surface and allow controlled release of drug payloads over a much longer duration and at lower maximum systemic exposure levels than possible with inhaled delivery of free drug molecules. This phase I application is focused on proof of concept using the potent antibiotic vancomycin as a payload. Specifically, in Aim 1) we will construct C35STrx-vancomycin conjugates using modular cleavable linkers and characterize their physical properties, size, cleavability and stability; in Aim 2) we will evaluate the conjugates in vitro for valency (drug:scaffold ratio), mucus protein binding activity and antibacterial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration) of cleaved vancomycin conjugates vs. free, non-conjugated vancomycin; and in Aim 3) we will determine the lung inflammation status, in vivo pharmacokinetics and airway residence time following intratracheal (IT) delivery to mice of vancomycin-C35STrx conjugates in both the reduced (target binding) and oxidized (inert) forms as compared to free vancomycin lacking the C35STrx scaffold. The pharmacokinetics of IT-delivered vancomycin conjugates will be compared to that of free vancomycin delivered intravenously. If the Aims of this project are achieved key validation of the feasibility of sustained mucosal release of active drug payloads conjugated to C35STrx will be established. This will enable subsequent Phase II activities to further develop and optimize sustained delivery of vancomycin or other antibiotics leading to human trials of potentially safer and more efficacious inhalation treatment regimens for CF."
"9617494","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to develop and validate a high-resolution spatio-temporal seizure source imaging technology to image and localize seizure origin and onset zone from noninvasive high resolution electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements to aid pre-surgical planning in partial epilepsy patients. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting about 50 million people worldwide. In approximately 30% of these patients the seizures are not controlled by medical therapy. Partial epilepsy, i.e. seizures that begin in a focal region of the brain, represents the most common type of drug resistant epilepsy. Epilepsy surgery has the best chance of curing partial epilepsy, but is only an option if the brain region generating seizures can be accurately localized and safely removed. Accurate localization of seizure origin and seizure onset zone is of paramount importance for successful epilepsy surgery. In this project, we propose to develop novel source imaging methods to image and localize seizure origin and seizure onset zone noninvasively. Of innovation is the proposed development of seizure source imaging approach, by means of novel data-driven spatio-temporal distributed source imaging and sparse signal processing strategy. Furthermore, we propose to rigorously validate the proposed approach in a group of epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial recordings and surgical resection treatment, and to disseminate the imaging software and clinical data to be developed in the proposed project. Our preliminary results are highly promising and attest to the feasibility and merits of the proposed approach. The specific aims of the proposed project are: Aim 1. Development and optimization of dynamic seizure imaging methods. Aim 2. Development of data- driven seizure source extent imaging methods. Aim 3. Validation of seizure source imaging from intracranial recordings and surgical outcomes. Noninvasive localization of seizure origin and seizure onset zone is of crucial significance for the successful surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy. The successful completion of the proposed research promises to lead to significantly advance our capability to manage drug-resistant partial epilepsy, benefitting numerous patients and the healthcare system."
"9530086","ABSTRACT. This project is motivated by two intersecting new needs. First, rapid advances in imaging technology are outpacing evaluation procedures that ensure quality and safety. Second, radiology research has a newfound focus on quantitative imaging biomarkers and radiomics. For both these trends of evaluating new technology and patient-specific assessments, we need a new generation of imaging phantoms that can provide clinically relevant gold standards. To meet these unmet needs, phantoms should ideally have a range of body habitus representing the diversity of patients, their organs should have realistic shape and texture, and detection tasks such as lesions should similarly be realistic in morphology with known contrast uptake. In other words, we would like to have patient-like anatomy with phantom-like gold standards.  We propose a new approach to designing imaging phantoms that will be highly customizable to the unique needs of researchers, clinical physicists, and radiologists. These phantoms will incorporate new rapid prototyping or ?3D printing? techniques, as well as new tissue-equivalent materials with or without uptake of contrast. If successful, these phantoms will boast voxel-level ground truth that would permit quantitative radiomics measurements, task-based assessment of performance, or patient-specific dosimetry.  Feasibility of our new approach will be demonstrated with 3 aims: (1) Develop new 3D printing devices and procedures to deliver high resolution, voxelized fabrication using graded blends of multiple materials. (2) Design new 3D printing materials that can match imaging characteristics of normal tissue as well as lesions with contrast uptake. (3) Create prototype phantoms for CT imaging that demonstrate these abilities for a diverse range of modalities including dual energy CT and CT angiography, as well as applications including reconstruction optimization, task-based assessment, and radiomics.  This work has many key innovations: voxelized printing of 3D volume, graded blending of multiple materials at the voxel level, new materials by nanoparticle doping or by dissolving salts, practical creation of tissue equivalent materials with common components, printing with 3 or 4 materials simultaneously, and anthropomorphic phantoms based on human subject image data. There will be significant impact by enabling practical yet customized creation of phantoms to suit every researcher?s unique needs. We envision an ?open source? philosophy by embracing publicly available materials, software, and procedures, with the goal of enabling every research group to create highly customizable phantoms. Such technology used to be possible only with very time-consuming, expensive custom jobs achievable only by one or two manufacturers, but we intend to share our innovations to encourage widespread adoption with the research community.  This work is a close collaboration between researchers from radiology (MPI Lo and investigator Samei), chemistry (MPI Wiley), and electrical & computer engineering (investigator Gehm)."
"9467567","ABSTRACT  22q11 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) patients have feeding and swallowing difficulties that compromise their  nutritional status and increase nasal, ear, and respiratory infections due to aspiration and reflux. Unfortunately,  there are few, if any, therapies to alleviate these significant health problems, and there is no focused basic  research into defining the underlying pathology that will inform new therapeutic approaches. We will test the  hypothesis that disrupted brainstem motor circuits are a primary site for dysphagia pathology and a  primary target for therapeutic intervention. We will advance understanding of the pathology of feeding and  swallowing dysfunction in dysphagia using the LgDel animal model for 22q11DS. These studies will provide the  foundation for identifying feasible therapeutic approaches and novel drug targets that could improve feeding  and swallowing in 22q11DS patients and other children with dysphagia. In Specific Aim 1 we will use a  combination of quantitative 3D cellular imaging and cell-class specific analyses of transcriptional changes to  assess how diminished 22q11 gene dosage disrupts motor neuron differentiation and innervation in brainstem  cranial motor nuclei that regulate feeding and swallowing. In Specific Aim 2 we will use a combination of in  vivo behavioral and pathology assays for feeding and swallowing difficulties and quantitative 3D cellular  imaging of relevant brainstem CN motor neurons to test if a second mutation in Raldh2, a key synthetic  enzyme for production of the developmental signal retinoic acid (RA), corrects feeding, swallowing, and cranial  motor neuron differentiation anomalies and dysfunction in LgDel mice. In Specific Aim 3 we will test the  hypothesis that altered excitability due to disrupted balance of excitation and inhibition of cranial motor neurons  underlies dysphagia due to the 22q11 deletion. We will use a combination of patch-clamp and intracellular  recordings to identify changes in the synaptic neurotransmission elicited upon fictive swallowing to brainstem  cranial neurons essential for feeding and swallowing and, furthermore, test whether clinically useful drugs in  children, such as GABA(A) receptor agonists (benzodiazepines), and/or NMDA receptor antagonists  (ketamine) can be repurposed to restore normal activity of swallowing motor neurons. The results of PROJECT  1 will define pediatric dysphagia circuit pathology and provide new pharmacologic, genetic, and genomic  insights that will provide a foundation for identifying new targets for novel therapeutic interventions. These  results will define key outcomes whose developmental origins will be identified in PROJECT 2 and whose  prevention will be the focus of PROJECT 3."
"9614787","SUMMARY High-risk types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) are responsible for virtually all cases of human cervical  carcinoma, as well as an increasing number of other malignancies including those of the head and neck, anus and vulva. Unfortunately, good treatment options for late-stage HPV+ malignancies are not currently available, in large part because the virus encodes a protein, E6, which disables cellular apoptotic pathways by accelerating the degradation of molecules such as FADD, caspase 8 and p53. This makes it difficult to eliminate HPV+  cancer cells using conventional inducers of apoptosis. To overcome this obstacle, our laboratory has identified several small molecules that block the binding between E6 and partners such as caspase 8 and E6AP.  According to our working model, the use of such molecules in a combinatorial manner will greatly increase the effectiveness of standard radio- and chemotherapeutic treatments. Both in vitro binding data and cellular data from our laboratory provide strong data in support of this working model, and it is now time to test our approach in an in vivo context. The overall objective of this current application, therefore, is to move our exciting in vitro and cellular observations into a mouse xenograft model. We will do this by combining spinacine, our best  molecular candidate, with two potential therapeutic agents: TRAIL, a biologic, and cisplatin, a more conventional chemotherapeutic, asking whether either of these combinations can reduce or eliminate the growth of HPV+ tumors, of either cervical or head and neck origin, in a nude mouse model. In particular, we will: 1) Determine the toxicity of spinacine in mice. We will assess the toxicity of spinacine in mice, defining the maximum  tolerated dose and identifying the optimum dose with which to carry out experiments designed to test its efficacy, and 2) Evaluate the ability of spinacine to synergize with TRAIL- and/or chemo-based therapies to  reduce or eliminate HPV+ tumor growth. We will assess the ability of spinacine to synergize with hrTRAIL and/or the DNA damaging drug cisplatin to inhibit tumor growth in a xenograft model. At the conclusion of this work, we will have 1) Determined the toxicity of the E6-inhibiting molecule spinacine in mice, and 2) Evaluated the effectiveness of combining spinacine with TRAIL- and cisplatin-based treatments in an animal model. This work has the potential to save the lives of thousands of patients suffering from HPV-associated malignancies."

In 2011, the MD STARnet was expanded to include cross- sectional surveillance for seven additional MDs (congenital, distal, Emery-Dreifuss, facioscapulohumeral, limb-girdle, myotonic, and oculopharyngeal). Our Iowa Site was one of four charter awardees for the MD STARnet in 2002 and was refunded in 2006 and 2011. As an MD STARnet site, we have successfully integrated clinical, programmatic, and referral resources provided by key partners in Iowa, such as the Iowa Neuromuscular Program, with the active, population-based resources of the Iowa Registry for Congenital and Inherited Disorders to conduct longitudinal surveillance of DBMD and cross-sectional surveillance for the additional MDs. Also, our partnership with the Reproductive Molecular Epidemiology Research and Education Program at The University of Iowa has provided experienced investigators to conduct data analyses and publish MD STARnet data. Overall, our infrastructure in Iowa now serves to advance knowledge about the prevalence of MD, clinical care for and co-morbidities diagnosed among MD cases, and the influence of family characteristics and social support on clinical outcomes. We propose to use our highly skilled and successful team to expand surveillance and research activities for MDs and to include additional, selected neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), specifically congenital myopathies, spinal muscle atrophy, Pompe disease and Charcot-Marie- Tooth disease. To accomplish this, we aim to: 1) build new and maintain existing relationships with MD and other NMD partners to enhance and promote surveillance efforts; 2) conduct longitudinal, population-based surveillance and research for all MDs by reviewing medical records and accessing administrative data; 3) pilot longitudinal surveillance for additional, selected NMDs; 4) develop and implement a communications plan to disseminate surveillance and research results to partners, patients, and policy makers to improve access to services and care; and 5) collaborate with CDC and other grantees to develop and implement an evaluation plan for the multi-site surveillance system. Using our proposed, population-based approach, we can gain increased insights into the epidemiology of MD and these additional NMDs and their complications. The data collected can also aid in providing treatment and support options beneficial to affected individuals and their families."
"9459956","Abstract Risky sexual behaviors have high personal, social, and financial costs. Family communication about sex can reduce risky sexual behaviors, but most studies focus only on the teen-parent dyad. High levels of extended- family involvement in childrearing and sexuality communication, such as with grandparents, aunts and uncles, older siblings and cousins, and ?fictive kin,? especially in Black and Latino families, suggest the importance of assessing this under-studied influence. Preliminary findings show significant associations between extended- family sexuality communication and teen sexual behavior, but the risk or protective effects of this communication remain unclear. To address NICHD's goal of identifying protective factors that prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, this mixed-methods study proposes the first comprehensive assessment of teens' extended-family sexuality communication and its associations with sexual behavior, and includes extended-family perspectives in order to apply quantitative findings to prevention and intervention programs. The proposed study applies an established conceptual model of parent-teen sexuality communication to extended family, which recognizes both direct talk about sex and indirect (less straightforward) sexuality communication, which predict teens' sexual beliefs and behaviors. The study will investigate three aims: 1) Compare teens' sexuality communication with parents and with extended family, 2) Investigate associations between extended-family sexuality communication and teens' sexual beliefs and behaviors, and 3) Explore how extended-family members perceive sexuality communication with teens and what tools they need to support teens' sexual health. To address these aims, this study uses an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, which includes teen surveys and extended-family interviews. Seventeen hundred male and female 11th and 12th graders from 4 schools will fill out an in-school online survey, and 30 extended-family members will be interviewed. Quantitative analyses will address Aims 1 & 2. It is hypothesized that parent and extended-family sexuality communication differ and that teens' perceptions of family members' sexuality communication and attitudes will be associated with teens' sexual beliefs and behaviors. Teens' closeness with the extended family member and values of familism are expected to shape the strength of these associations. The direction of associations will vary by whether teens talk with older or younger extended family. Qualitative analyses will guide implementation of findings from Aims 1 & 2 to support school and community-based prevention and intervention efforts. The significance of this work lies in its comprehensive focus on the full range of partners in family sexuality communication, assessing whether this communication is helpful or harmful to teens' sexual health. It contributes to public health by informing whether and how to include larger family systems, beyond the nuclear family, into prevention and intervention programs.  "
"9477979","Project Summary/Abstract Syphilis is increasing in the United States (U.S.) and Baltimore has one of the most severe epidemics among Black gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men (MSM). The racial disparities and number of new syphilis infections and reinfections demonstrate that our current prevention strategies are not effective. The proposed study will provide a new understanding of the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of syphilis among Black MSM including HIV infected and uninfected MSM for urban areas in the U.S. in order to identify ways to alter and strengthen local health department practices. We will explicitly address limitations in current practice and previous research on key aspects of the syphilis prevention-care continuum including: syphilis case finding, access to and treatment completion, treatment follow-up and the likelihood of reinfection and co- infection with HIV and other STIs over time. Our approach will include a cohort study of Black MSM, respondent driven-sampling and a focus on places where sexual networks are formed such as sex partner meeting venues (e.g. clubs, bars, internet sites, parks) and their context, as venues have been shown to be an effective method of accessing hard-to-reach populations at risk for syphilis. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Determine sex partner meeting venues and their characteristics (e.g. type, venue network centrality) as well as social and sexual network individual risk behaviors (e.g. sex without a condom, new partners, substance use) associated with new syphilis incidence and repeat syphilis over time; (2) Determine individual (e.g. health care access and usage patterns, insurance status, distance to clinic, substance use), social network (e.g. support, risk network) and systems level (e.g. availability of health care services, cultural competency factors. perceived stigma) healthcare-related factors associated with treatment completion and engagement in follow-up for syphilis over time; and (3) Examine the impact of clinical factors (e.g. syphilis stage, reinfection, baseline nontreponemal titers, HIV and PrEP status) on changes in non- treponemal antibody titers over time following treatment. Our study will be cooperatively designed and conducted by the Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD), Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and CDC to inform public health targeted control activities for syphilis and co- morbid syphilis/HIV infection. The BCHD and JHU have a long-standing, successful partnership in the translation of evidence to public health practice. In addition, our expert team has extensive experience and demonstrated past performance in recruitment and retention of MSM in longitudinal studies, and in the collection of sociodemographic, epidemiologic, sexual and social network data and biologic specimens for research purposes. In addition, we bring a rich track record of syphilis clinical care and research, sex partner meeting place research and translation of evidence to public health practice."
"9515458","Although inflammation is normally short-lived and quickly resolves to limit tissue injury, chronic inflammation is associated with several human cancer, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBMs are very aggressive tumors with very low patient survival rates. These tumors are characterized by necrosis and profound inflammation; with cytokines supporting GBM progression. The mechanisms by which chronic inflammation develops and persists in GBM regardless of multiple anti-inflammatory feedback loops remain elusive. One of the hallmarks of ongoing acute inflammation is cytokine-driven temporal activation of the p65/p50 NF-?B transcription factor, which drives expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. However, targeting activation of p65/p50 NF-?B has thus far not been beneficial. Nevertheless, p65/p50 NF-?B also initiates several feedback mechanisms, including induction of expression of RelB, a unique member of the NF-?B family which forms complexes with p50 and suppresses cytokine expression by mechanisms such as epigenetic silencing. This mechanism provide long- lasting effects that limit inflammation.We found that although expression of RelB is similarly induced in primary astrocytes and GBM, RelB suppresses cytokine expression in astrocytes, but unexpectedly enhances their expression in GBM cells. Thus, the anti-inflammatory RelB-driven feedback loop is converted into a feed-forward loop fueling chronic inflammation in GBM. We further found that this differential regulation depends on a transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), which is located in the cytoplasm of astrocytes but is exclusively present in the nuclei of GBM cells. We also found that YY1 interacts with RelB and the complexes of RelB/YY1/p50 may be responsible for the activation of cytokine expression in GBM cells. These preliminary data imply a critical role of YY1 in GBM and support a mechanistic model which explains the development and persistence of chronic inflammation associated with GBM. We propose that YY1 acts as a molecular switch in GBM converting RelB-dependent epigenetic silencing into RelB/YY1/p50- dependent transcriptional activation, which induces chronic inflammation and promotes GBM aggressiveness. We will: 1. establish a molecular mechanism of YY1-dependent gene activation and importance of YY1 in GBM in vitro, and 2. determine the role of YY1 in GBM development and progression in vivo."
"9495187","Project Summary We propose to purchase a multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) system from iThera, a whole-body small animal optoacoustic imaging system with broad excitation capability from the visible to near infrared spectral range. Optoacoustic tomography is an exciting new technology that combines the high sensitivity of optical imaging with the depth sensitivity and resolution of ultrasonography for high-resolution imaging of soft tissue structures, endogenous chromophores, and exogenous optical contrast agents, without using ionizing radiation. A combination of multispectral laser excitation with a 270-degree coverage provides true multi-slice anatomic and contrast-enhanced images of small animals from head to tail. Differential absorption of light by endogenous hemoglobin-related biomolecules aids in delineating vascular structures from surrounding tissue in real time for monitoring angiogenesis in cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other diseases. The system also uses the ratio of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin to enable functional neuroimaging, identify hypoxic conditions in cancer microenvironments, and track how pathophysiological processes mediate health and disease. Similarly, biosynthetic fluorescent proteins, synthetic dyes, and light-absorbing nanoparticles can serve as molecular probes for whole-body imaging of animal models of human diseases and quantitative monitoring of treatment response. This instrument, which will be part of the Washington University Molecular Imaging Center, will support 15 NIH-funded users from diverse research fields, enhancing their current research capabilities with non-invasive, longitudinal visualization of disease processes deep within living animals, and quantification of biological processes without euthanizing animals. Availability of this instrument to the NIH-funded researchers and many other minor users at Washington University will not only enhance their ongoing studies but also stimulate new discoveries in disease processes and the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic agents for diverse diseases. The MSOT system will be housed in the Washington Molecular Imaging Center, which supports the preclinical optical imaging needs of over 80 NIH-funded investigators at Washington University and the surrounding research community. Highly experienced personnel will manage this instrument, train new users and provide expertise for research design, data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Overall, this instrument will facilitate new discoveries in preclinical research for eventual translation to human subjects."
"9438923","PROJECT SUMMARY  Autophagy is the process of cellular recycling, in which macromolecules and organelles are targeted for lysosomal degradation and the resulting metabolites are distributed back to the cell. Genetic analysis of aging in the nematode and other model organisms has identified many interventions that can influence lifespan, and autophagy has emerged as a common mechanism contributing to longevity. However, the role that specific sugars, recycled from the autolysosome by the Spin/Spns1 family of sugar transporters, play in mediating longevity has received very little attention.  There are four Spinster/Spin orthologs in C. elegans. We have found that spin-1 is required for lifespan extension mediated by down-regulation of the target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathway in worms, while spin-2 is required for lifespan extension in insulin receptor (daf-2) mutants. These data lead to our hypothesis that SPIN proteins mediate recycling of different cellular metabolites via autophagy and the requirement for these metabolites differs with the mechanism of lifespan extension. This hypothesis is supported by cross species rescue experiments. Homozygous spns1 mutation in zebrafish (zspns1) leads to developmental senescence associated with autolysosomal defects, while zspns1 haploinsufficiency leads to shortened lifespan in adulthood. We have determined that the zspns-1-mutant phenotype can be rescued by wild-type zspns1, Drosophila spin (dspin), human spns1 (hspns1) as well as worm spin-1 and spin-4, indicating that these proteins are functionally conserved and therefore have the capacity to transport the same substrate(s). Furthermore, we have determined that the sugar acid, glucuronic acid (GlucA), can be transported by hSpns1 in vitro, suggesting that this molecule is a potential substrate for worm SPIN-1 and SPIN-4, as well as zebrafish and human Spns1. Interestingly, neither worm spin-2 or spin-3 rescue the mutant fish phenotype indicating that these proteins likely have a different substrate preference. In this proposal we will further characterize the role of C. elegans spin genes in different models of lifespan extension. In parallel, we will identify the exact nature of their substrates and investigate the physiological relevance of candidate substrates, in order to provide a metabolic basis for the effects of SPIN proteins on different paradigms of lifespan extension.  In addition to autophagic recycling of amino acids and lipids, we propose that recycling of specific sugars is also important in specifying the lifespan effects of a particular longevity intervention. The identification of these sugars will not only provide an opportunity to address whether they are causal in driving longevity, but will further define the importance of sugar recycling in the late stages of autophagy. This in turn is likely to have implications for lysosomal storage diseases, as well as cancer and age-related disease."

"9451930","Project Summary/Abstract The incidence of new cancer diagnoses is declining each year, however the frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to rise, with a 5-year survival rate of 15%. HCC typically results from chronic liver disease and fibrosis, and liver transplant is the only curative treatment although recurrence can occur. Hence there is a need for improved therapies, and understanding how HCC develops and thrives in a fibrotic background will provide additional therapeutic targets. Wnt expression is upregulated in several cancers including HCC. Wnt ligands can function canonically to activate ?-catenin signaling, or noncanonically to regulate calcium signaling and antagonize ?-catenin. There are 19 total Wnts in the mammalian genome, and all hepatic cell types express Wnts which are secreted to cause autocrine or paracrine signaling. We and others have shown cell types including hepatocytes (HP) and macrophages (MP) produce different Wnts in several liver regeneration and injury models, however studies assessing cell-specific Wnt contributions in HCC are lacking. We hypothesize HP and MP produce Wnts important for carcinogenesis, and we developed cell-specific Wntless knockout animals (HP-KO and MP-KO). Wntless is required for Wnt secretion from a cell, therefore we functionally remove all Wnt activity. HP-KO and MP-KO and littermate controls will undergo a series of diethylnitrosamine and carbon tetrachloride injections (DEN/CCl4) to develop hepatic injury and eventual progression to fibrosis and HCC. This robust model leads to HCC by 5 months in 100% of mice. Furthermore, the DEN/CCl4 model allows us to assess HP and MP Wnts in the microenvironment and the tumor itself. Preliminary data suggests several Wnts are upregulated in control mice after DEN/CCl4. To test the role of HP- and MP-specific Wnts, we have developed two specific aims. Pilot studies identify MP-KO have greater tumor burden, inflammation, and injury than MP-CON at 5 months. Further, MP-KO exhibit frequent cholangiocarcinomas (CC) in addition to HCC. In Aim 1 we will test three hypotheses to explain increased tumorigenesis in MP-KO. Namely, (1) MP Wnts regulate macrophage polarization and reduce inflammation, (2) MP Wnts act to prevent combined HCC-CC (cHCC-CC), a more aggressive and lesser characterized form of liver cancer, or (3) MP Wnts are required for hepatic regeneration after injury, and blocking regeneration leads to a growth advantage for tumor cells. Furthermore, HP-KO and HP-CON have comparable injury and tumor burden at 5 months, however small CK19 positive nodules are present in HP-KO. CK19 is a marker of dedifferentiated tumors suggesting increased progenitor-like phenotype. We previously have shown HP secrete Wnt5a to terminate liver regeneration through ?-catenin inhibition after partial hepatectomy. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that HP Wnts prevent tumor dedifferentiation through secretion of Wnt5a to inhibit ?-catenin activity, and we predict HP-KO will have fully dedifferentiated tumors by 7 months. Taken together, our data will elucidate Wnt signaling in HCC and may provide more targeted therapeutic options."
"9499091","PROJECT SUMMARY N-terminally-truncated and modified amyloid-beta (A?) peptides are abundant in cerebral amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pyroglutamate3 A? (pyroGlu3 A?) is generated upon N-terminal truncation of A? followed by cyclization by glutaminyl cyclase to convert glutamic acid at residue 3 to pyroGlu3 A?, which aggregates quickly, resists degradation, and is neurotoxic. AD progression appears to correlate with the presence of pyroGlu3 A? peptide aggregates in brain. Growing evidence, including our own, indicates that pyroGlu3 A? acts as a seed for A? deposition and accelerates inflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline; therefore, targeted removal of this toxic species by immunotherapy will reduce A? deposition, inflammation and neuritic dystrophy, and protect cognition. We have demonstrated that targeted removal of pathogenic pyroGlu3 A? by immunotherapy using an anti-pyroGlu3 A? IgG1 mAb (07/1) in a prevention study and the IgG2a version of the same antibody (07/2a) in a therapeutic study, reduced pyroGlu3 A? and general (non-pyroGlu3) A?, suggesting that pyroGlu3 A? acts as a seed for A? deposition. Furthermore, the anti- pyroGlu3 A? mAbs protected cognition. Together with Probiodrug AG, we have developed a CDC-mutant (K332A) version of the 07/2a mAb (07/2a-k) to avoid vascular inflammation observed in clinical trials using plaque binding A? antibodies. Here, we propose the following hypotheses: 1. 07/2a-k, a novel murine anti- pyroGlu3 IgG2a CDC-mutant antibody, will effectively reduce plaques and protect cognition while avoiding potential inflammatory vascular side effects in APP/E4 mice that are prone to vascular amyloid and microhemorrhages; 2. Microglia will have a less inflammatory response to 07/2-k exposure. 3. 07/2a-k antibody will neutralize the toxic effects of pyroGlu3 A? on neurons (in vitro). Our collaborators at Probiodrug AG (Halle, Germany) will provide us with 4 high-affinity, highly selective pyroGlu A? mAbs (including 07/2a-k, the CDC mutant version of 07/2a) and an Asp1 3D6-mimic (3D6-L), identical to the murine precursor to bapineuzumab, which led to vascular inflammation in clinical trials. The goal is to determine whether passive immunotherapy with the novel CDC-mutant anti-pyroGlu3 A? mAb (07/2a-k) is safe and effective in a relevant pre-clinical animal model as a prelude to a clinical trial for AD."
"9431215","Quiescence of Limbal Epithelial Stem Cells Summary  The stem cells (SCs) of the corneal epithelium located in the limbal ?palisades of Vogt? are the ultimate source of maintaining corneal epithelial homeostasis. Clinically, loss of limbal SCs or dysfunction of the limbal niche leads to corneal blindness due to limbal SC deficiency (LSCD). During the last funding period, we successfully isolated and expanded limbal niche cells (NC) and established in vitro niches by SC-NC reunion in 3D Matrigel or HC-HA/PTX3, i.e., a novel matrix purified from amniotic membrane. Using these in vitro models, we have proven the hypothesis that maintenance of close SC-NC contact is crucial for preventing SCs from adopting corneal fate decision and maintaining SC self-renewal and quiescence through a balancing act between Wnt and BMP signaling. Herein, we propose to explore the signaling mechanism wherein SC quiescence is controlled by delineating how HC-HA/PTX3 transmits CD44-mediated signaling to maintain the NC phenotype and activate BMP signaling (Aim 1) and how PCP signaling reinforces BMP signaling in NCs to augment SC quiescence (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will determine how Notch signaling is established between SCs and NCs through the polar expression of Notch ligands and receptors under the influence of PCP signaling so as to transmit BMP signaling from NCs to SCs to achieve SC quiescence (Aim 3). In 3D Matrigel, noggin suppresses BMP signaling to allow full activation of Wnt signaling in order to promote SC self-renewal. In HC-HA/PTX3, we will determine whether noggin acts differently from in 3D Matrigel by inducing an ?alert? stage of SC self-renewal without affecting pre-existing BMP and PCP signaling by upregulating NKD1 that continues to suppress Wnt signaling (Aim 4). Successful completion of the above Aims will shed new light on the signaling mechanism wherein SC quiescence and self-renewal are maintained by close contact with NCs. Consequently, we will learn a better strategy to maintain the SC pool so as to ensure homeostasis of the corneal epithelium. This new knowledge will also help us devise a new tissue engineering strategy for the corneal epithelium by successful recapitulation of the regulatory mechanism executed by close interaction with NCs. Future studies of how such signaling might be altered by pathogenic factors derived from non-resolving inflammation will help us unravel the pathogenesis and potential new therapies of LSCD. Collectively, these studies may one day help us realize the considerable promise held by adult SCs in treating a number of diseases in the body."
"9653241","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kinase inhibitors created a new paradigm in chemotherapy and are a major focus of new oncology drug development, but developmental success rates are low (5-10%). Resistance to kinase inhibitors occurs through target-dependent mechanisms (e.g. point mutations that abrogate drug binding) and target-independent mechanisms (e.g. upregulation of alternative signaling pathways, termed kinome reprogramming). Therefore, combinations of inhibitors that target several kinases at once are desirable to have a better chance of avoiding the resistance/relapse cycle. Detecting protein kinase activity inside living cells (rather than in lysates or reconstituted systems) is important or understanding kinase inhibitor drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and would lead to better screening for inhibitors likely to make it through the development process. We will develop multiplexed, cell-based assays for specific kinase activities that are important to inhibitor response and kinome reprogramming, and use them to detect kinase activation profiles in patient cells and for inhibitor screens. Phosphorylation of the biosensors is detected using time-resolved lanthanide luminescence measurements, in which Tb3+ emission energy is measured directly via small molecule fluorophores to give different emission colors depending on the fluorophore. In Aim 1, we will establish quantitative assays for activity (and therefore inhibition) of key kinases in drug sensitive and drug resistant CML cells, profiling the pathway activation phenotypes in therapeutically relevant cellular states. We will use the set of biosensors we have already established in preliminary work, and add biosensors for other kinases as they are developed. The assays will be established with cell lines and samples from CML patients (comparing to healthy controls), and validated with RT-qPCR and SWATH proteomics. In Aim 2, we will screen for synergies between existing kinase inhibitor drugs and new compounds (via libraries). We will also develop homogenous multiplexed analysis of biosensor phosphorylation using energy transfer from lanthanides to organic dyes. In Aim 3, we expand the biosensor design pipeline to develop new, non-natural peptide substrates to use as biosensors for other kinases. The work described in this aim will add to the set of biosensors we already have available. Completion of the work described in this proposal will give us a novel assay for multiple kinases, a suite of new biosensors as well as new and refined detection strategies to use in screening. Drug discovery will benefit from this technology's ability to address kinome reprogramming mechanisms by targeting several kinases at a time. Drug development will benefit from companion assays for multiple targets that could follow a drug or drug combination through the hit to lead transition, target validation, pre-clinical studies, clinial trials, and beyond into treatment management. This assay and its associated tools will contribute to the next generation of targeted therapy development in cancer by breaking new ground in our ability to model the disease environment during drug screening and development."
"9648661","Ebola virus (EBOV; also known as Zaire ebolavirus) (family Filoviridae) is among the most lethal infectious agents known, producing sporadic outbreaks of severe, and highly lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs). Owing to high morbidity and mortality rates in natural outbreaks, lack of prophylactic and treatment options, aerosol transmission potential, and their highly virulent nature, Ebola viruses have been identified as both NIAID Category A Priority pathogens and CDC Category A Agents of Bioterrorism. Despite this, the current standard of care is limited to palliative treatment and no therapeutic interventions have been approved against EBOV infection. Among many prophylactic and therapeutic platforms currently under development, monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology has emerged as one of the most promising treatment methods. Worldwide, there exist ~100 mAbs against EBOV that have been characterized to varying degrees. Six of these mAbs have demonstrated complete to partial protection of NHPs when administered from 1 to 4- 5 days after lethal infection. The goal of Project 1 is to achieve total protection in NHPs as late as possible in the course of infection with an ideal cocktail. To this end, the -100 mAbs identified will be produced in a plant expression system and tested in vitro and in vivo for efficacy against EBOV infection. All mAbs will be tested for efficacy in mice and the top performs will subsequently be tested in guinea pigs, individually and in combination. The best mAb combinations will be further tested in NHPs. This downselection process will take into consideration efficacy, binding site, function and complementarity of each mAb. Overall, this proposal is to lay down the scientific foundation for evidence-based selection of the most effective mAb countermeasure against EBOV infection. This will provide an immediate option for compassionate use in post-exposure situations, a research benchmark for evaluation and comparison of additional mAb therapies that might be developed in the future, and essential components of the treatment that will precede complete pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies prior to FDA licensure."

"9418522","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although increasing animal evidence supports the hypothesis that in utero exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds can have a long-term impact on the health of the 2nd and subsequent generations, the evidence in humans is nearly non-existent. In addition, individuals may have differences in susceptibility to chemical exposure based on their genetic make-up. We propose to study genetic susceptibility in a unique population of children whose mothers, participants of the Seveso Women's Health Study (SWHS), were exposed to one of the most potent endocrine disruptors, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin).  On July 10, 1976, an explosion at a chemical plant near Seveso, Italy resulted in a toxic plume that exposed nearby residents to high levels of TCDD. The SWHS, a retrospective cohort study, was initiated in 1996, to investigate the health of 981 women who were newborn to age 40 years in 1976, had resided in the immediate vicinity of the plant, and had archived samples of blood collected soon after the explosion. The SWHS is the only comprehensive study of health effects of TCDD exposure in a female population, and has the unique benefit of measurements of individual-level TCDD in blood collected near the time of the explosion. We are currently re-contacting SWHS women to enroll ~955 children aged 0-38 years in a study of their health, to determine whether in utero TCDD exposure is associated with health outcomes at birth or later in life.  The proposed study will use DNA from blood collected during the current (2014-2016) follow up to genotype mother-child pairs in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (gene: AhR, protein: AhR) pathway, an enzymatic network that directs the metabolism of TCDD and other xenobiotics in humans. We will conduct a gene-by- environment (GxE) analysis to evaluate the modifying effect of genetic polymorphisms in the AhR pathway on susceptibility to dioxin toxicity in women and their children born after the explosion. In particular, we will use longitudinal measurements of serum TCDD (1976 and 1996) to examine differences in TCDD metabolism across genetic subgroups of the SWHS (Aim 1). We will then use genotype data on mother-child pairs in AhR pathway genes to examine interaction between the maternal and child genotypes with in utero dioxin exposure on birthweight in children born after the explosion. With its targeted focus on the AhR pathway, this study is uniquely equipped to examine the influence of genotype on dioxin half-life longitudinally and the first study of how both maternal and child genetics may shape fetal susceptibilities to dioxin."
"9518331","PROJECT SUMMARY Speech is central to human life. Yet how the human brain processes speech in complex everyday situations remains poorly understood. One prominent idea is that speech perception is carried out using brain areas and mechanisms that are used for processing sounds more generally. And it has been suggested that these mechanisms become specialized for speech through learning, resulting in a speech processing network in the brain that processes increasingly complex aspects of the speech signal at successive hierarchical stages. But questions about the function of this hierarchy remain. In particular, while it is commonly acknowledged that seeing a speaker?s face in noisy environments can improve comprehension, our understanding of how visual speech influences the hierarchical processing of speech remain unclear. This is unfortunate as speech processing, and multisensory speech processing in particular, have been reported to be affected in a number of clinical disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Thus, as well as contributing to our understanding of this most fundamental of human abilities, better knowledge of the neural mechanisms underpinning audiovisual speech processing could have important clinical research implications. One of the principal reasons for our lack of knowledge on the neurophysiology of audiovisual speech is the technical challenge associated with indexing the neural processing of natural speech with high temporal resolution and at multiple levels of the speech processing hierarchy. Non-human primates represent a less than perfect model for studying human speech processing, the hemodynamic changes underlying functional magnetic resonance imaging are too slow to track natural speech dynamics, and electrocorticography samples only a limited number of brain areas and cannot be broadly applied in clinical research. Recently, our group has introduced several new approaches for indexing natural speech processing using electroencephalography (EEG). These include entirely novel frameworks for producing dependent measures of the hierachical encoding of natural speech, and for quantifying multisensory integration of natural audiovisual speech. The present proposal seeks to exploit this opportunity to test the hypothesis that the integration of audio and visual speech is a flexible, multistage process that adapts to optimize comprehension based on the current listening conditions. Across three objectives the proposal aims to characterize this flexibility by determining how the hierarchical processing stage at which visual and audio speech are integrated varies as a function of 1) the listening environment, 2) the visual information available and 3) the deployment of attention. The work promises to bring a new depth of understanding to the perception of one of humanity?s most essential signals. And it will introduce several novel analyses and experimental paradigms that should be easily deployable in tackling research on clinical cohorts in which speech processing and/or multisensory integration is impaired."
"9471221","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Serotonin (5-HT) signaling in brain reward circuits modulates drug-seeking behavior. Specifically, 5- HT6 receptors provide excitatory signals to medium spiny neurons that make up the direct and indirect pathways, the two main outputs from the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These receptors are localized to the primary cilia of neurons, signal through type 3 adenylyl cyclase (AC3), and play a key role in drug reward and reinforcement. How the 5-HT6 receptor and its downstream signaling components influence drug taking via reward circuitry remains unclear. Our lab has shown that increased expression of 5-HT6 receptors specifically in indirect but not direct pathway results in a decrease in cocaine self-administration by increasing the sensitivity to the reinforcing properties of cocaine. Thus, 5-HT6 receptors appear to influence cocaine reinforcement in a pathway-selective manner. However, overexpressed receptors may have altered the subcellular distribution and cilia- specific localization of 5-HT6 receptors. The proposed experiments will further test the pathway specificity by knocking out endogenous 5-HT6 receptor signaling in a pathway-selective manner. This proposal seeks to determine the exact nature of how endogenous 5-HT6 receptors regulate cocaine self-administration, and whether cilia-specific signaling plays a role in addiction-like behavior. Aim 1 will create a Cre-dependent CRISPR-Cas9 viral vector targeting the 5-HT6 receptor gene to enable pathway-specific knockout of the receptor with an intersectional viral strategy. Aim 2 will investigate the pathway-selective influence of 5-HT6 receptor signaling on cocaine self-administration in rats by disrupting expression of this receptor in the direct or indirect pathway neurons selectively. Behavioral economic analysis of cocaine taking will deepen our understanding of how these receptors modulate cocaine intake, reinforcement, and motivation. Aim 3 examine the molecular mechanism by which 5- HT6 receptors regulate cocaine-seeking behavior by disrupting AC3 signaling in a pathway-specific manner. This will allow us to validate the link between AC3 and 5-HT6 receptor function, and provide novel insights into the effects of cilia-specific signaling on cocaine self-administration. The novel intersectional knockout approach in this proposal has broad implications for addiction research, as well as neuroscience in general, and provides a training plan that enables the expansion of my current knowledge and repertoire of molecular and behavioral techniques. Together, these three Aims, along with the other elements of my training plan, could inform new treatments for addiction, prepare me to become an independent clinician-neuroscientist, and address my desire to conduct research that spans the translational gap between basic neuroscience and the devastating impact of addiction in families and society."
"9541995","The nervous system uses neural circuits to generate cognition and behavior. These circuits are often disrupted in spinal cord injury or stroke, and are aberrant in mental disorders. One way to treat these conditions is to re- grow or modify neural circuits. Thus, understanding how neural circuits are assembled may aid in the design of regenerative therapies, and brain stimulation therapies to treat mental disorders. During circuit assembly, nervous systems exhibit patterned spontaneous network activity (PaSNA). PaSNA is necessary to build a functional circuit in vertebrates and invertebrates, yet we know surprisingly little about the mechanisms involved. My strategy is to use Drosophila embryonic and larval locomotion as a system to uncover the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms by which PaSNA promotes neural circuit assembly. The advent of new tools in Drosophila, such as optogenetic reagents, Gal4 lines to manipulate single neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), and a transmission electron microscopy connectome of the entire CNS make this a powerful system for studying neural circuits. Similar to vertebrates, premotor neurons are required for PaSNA. This raises the questions that this proposal addresses: Which specific interneuron populations generate PaSNA, do different interneurons have different patterns of activity, and how does interneuron PaSNA drive motor circuit development? With the use of Gal4 lines unique to our system and genetically encoded calcium indicators, I will identify the interneurons participating in PaSNA. I will use a characterized circuit required for larval locomotion together with optogenetic tools to identify the effect of PaSNA in establishing circuit connectivity and function. This proposal will reveal (1) the neuronal components that generate PaSNA during locomotor circuit assembly, (2) whether PaSNA is stochastic or stereotypic with the population of active neurons, (3) whether there is a correlation between neuronal identity and participation in PaSNA; (4) whether PaSNA is required for locomotor circuit establishment, and (5) whether PaSNA is required for locomotor circuit function. These represent critical advances that will provide insight into the formation and function of neural circuits in both Drosophila and mammals, where PaSNA is a conserved element of neural circuit formation."
"9635870","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current application aims to map the medial amygdala (MeA) estrogen receptor alpha (ER?) neurocircuits that are essential for physical activity and body weight control. Our studies will not only advance our current understanding about the physical activity control and the development of obesity in general but also identify new feasible intervention targets for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to combat sedentary behaviors. Therefore, this proposed research is directly relevant to public health and the NIH's mission. I have four years of postdoctoral research experience when submitting this application (07/2011-07/2015). My long- term goal is to establish myself as an independent investigator in the area of central regulation of physical activity and metabolism. In order to develop an independent researcher in this field, I will use my K99-funded mentored period to (1) gain new training in exercise physiology to compare different aspects of treadmill exercise and voluntary wheel running behavior in mouse model; (2) implement the most advanced knowledge about physical activity/metabolism and cutting-edge techniques in the field of central regulation of metabolic behavior; (3) advance grantsmanship, project and laboratory management skills, mentoring, teaching skills, etc. I will start looking for university faculty positions towards the end of the first year of the K99 stage to ensure the smooth transition to the R00 phase. The ovary hormone, estrogen, plays an important role in maintaining normal energy homeostasis by regulating food intake and physical activity. While ER? expressed by pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) modulates food intake, estrogen- responsive neurons influencing locomotion remain undefined. Recently, we demonstrated that ER? expressed by the Single Minded 1 (SIM1) neurons in the MeA dedicated to promoting locomotion in both males and females. Additionally, acute activation of MeA SIM1 neurons led to short term increase of locomotion. These suggest that ER? expressed by MeA SIM1 neurons constitute part of a previously undefined locomotor circuit that is used in both males and females. Here, we plan to further define and understand how this MeA estrogen- responsive neural circuit promotes locomotion. In the aim 1 and 2 (K99 phase), we will (1) test if ER? in the MeA is required for the coordinated control of locomotor activity, body weight and exercise-induced metabolic benefits by using mouse/virus genetic loss-of-function and gain-of-function models to specifically delete or overexpress whole ER? population in the MeA; (2) further demonstrate if activation/inhibition of MeA ER? neurons increases/decreases locomotion by using a novel technology termed Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD). With this information in hand, we will then start aim 3 (R00 phase) to map the downstream neural circuits of MeA ER? neurons and identify the critical MeA downstream neural circuits where estrogen acts to stimulate locomotion and prevent obesity. The proposed studies represent logical extensions to our previous work and offer an excellent opportunity to understand the neural basis of estrogenic regulation of locomotion, not only in females but also in males."
"9384749","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is the main risk factor for developing type II diabetes (T2D), a major and growing public health problem. Elevated adiposity leads to central leptin and insulin resistance, which in turn can trigger changes in homeostatic neural circuitry in the hypothalamus. This can ultimately lead to the development of metabolic syndrome and T2D. Neurogenesis in the adult hypothalamic parenchyma is disrupted by high fat diet (HFD) and leptin deficiency, leading to a reduction in the number of anorexigenic POMC- expressing neurons. We have recently identified hypothalamic tanycytes as a second source of newborn neurons in adult hypothalamus. Our preliminary data suggests that while HFD and leptin deficiency stimulate tanycyte-derived neurogenesis, tanycyte-derived neurons promote weight gain in wildtype animals but inhibit weight gain in leptin-deficient mice. The studies proposed here aim to improve our understanding of how tanycyte-derived neurons regulate body weight, and to determine how dietary signals regulate tanycyte-derived neurogenesis. First, using genetic approaches, we plan to investigate the physiological consequences of selectively disrupting and enhancing tanycyte-derived neurogenesis. Second, we plan to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which both HFD-induced cytokines such as CNTF and leptin regulate tanycyte-derived neurogenesis. Finally, we propose to determine the exact identity of tanycyte-derived neurons and to identify their post-synaptic targets. We anticipate that these studies will ultimately assist in the design of novel therapies for treatment of obesity and T2D."

"9422720","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ulcerative colitis is a condition that is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colon. It is an important pediatric disease as 25% of all cases begin in childhood and its incidence is steadily increasing. It carries considerable morbidity and shortened life expectancy. Current therapies are suboptimal as some therapies are associated with high failure rate while others are associated with significant drug toxicity. 5-ASA is considered first line of therapy in mild to moderate disease. UC is believed to be related to a genetically and environmentally-generated altered immune response to the enteric microbiome. Previous work in the PI laboratory suggests that children with UC harbor a unique gut microbial profile, which can predict therapeutic response. Therefore, modifying the gut microbiome may provide therapeutic benefit. However, attempts to modify the gut microbiome were largely unsuccessful until the advent of fecal transplant for treating colitis. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been introduced several decades ago in an attempt to restore the gut microbial balance and it appears to be a more efficient method to safely and effectively change and sustain the gut microbial composition. To this date there have been a number of successful case reports in ulcerative colitis, to suggest control of disease activity and a cure in some cases However, there has not been uniform success reported for the use of FMT, especially in severe cases recalcitrant to medical therapy. Thus, it has been difficult for the scientific community to embrace this therapy, especially in children, as there have been no controlled pediatric studies published to this date. Therefore, there is a strong need to determine the safety and efficacy of FMT in treating UC in prospective, randomized pediatric clinical trials. We hypothesize that children with ulcerative colitis will respond to fecal transplant therapy which will modify their gt microbial profile. We propose a randomized, double- blinded, controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fecal microbial transplant from healthy donor versus placebo FMT (child's own stool) in combination with 5-ASA in inducing mucosal healing in mild to moderate disease in children with ulcerative colitis. We also propose studying the effect of transplant on gut microbial profile using advanced molecular tools. Results of this study will help us understand the mechanism by which the gut microbiome contributes to this disease and examine the viability and durability in FMT recipients with a potential paradigm shifting for ulcerative coliti treatment in children."
"9664058","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Award application is to provide the PI with training in advanced basic science and clinical research techniques. This training will progress him toward his long-term goal of performing independent translational orthopedic rehabilitation research to establish new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of musculoskeletal and joint trauma. The pathophysiological factors that contribute to the initial onset and early progression of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) following severe knee trauma, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture, are poorly understood. One factor that may predispose ACL-reconstructed patients to the onset and progression of PTOA is neuromuscular dysfunction of the quadriceps, which develops secondary to the combined catabolic sequelae produced by the index injury, subsequent surgery, and accompanying muscle disuse. Contrasting what is observed with models of uncomplicated disuse, muscular weakness and dysfunctions following ACL-reconstruction are not completely remediated by strength training and orthopedic rehabilitation. This persistent muscle weakness is thought to predispose patients to PTOA by decreasing the ability of the quadriceps to attenuate shock during gait and maintain normal distribution of forces across the tibiofemoral joint. These biomechanical alterations can lead to abnormal contact stresses and loading within the knee, which provoke adaptations in cartilage metabolism that hasten its degradation and the onset and progression of PTOA. Our goal is to address these neuromuscular maladaptations in their infancy through targeting of their root causes with therapeutic interventions. At present, however, the specific cellular and sub-cellular adaptations that occur in muscle to promote strength loss, the associated biomechanical gait alterations, and changes in articular cartilage composition have not been clearly defined. The proposed studies are designed to address this knowledge gap in three specific aims: 1) to determine the effects of acute ACL injury on skeletal muscle function, structure and protein expression at the molecular, cellular, tissue and whole body levels; 2) to define adaptations in gait biomechanics that result from muscle strength loss; and 3) to evaluate the loss of glycosaminoglycan and type-II collagen fibril disruption in the tibiofemoral articular cartilage. T accomplish these goals, we will study 20 ACL-injured subjects with serial assessments of bilateral skeletal muscle strength and function as well as cartilage-specific MRI at pre-surgical baseline and 6-month follow up; and assess 3D gait kinematics at 6 months post-ACL-reconstruction. Results from these studies will advance knowledge by providing novel mechanistic information about the effect of ACL injury and subsequent surgical intervention on skeletal muscle size and function and its relationship to altered gait and cartilage biology in humans. These results have the potential to impact clinical care by informing the development of new interventions to specifically target the cellular and sub-cellular muscle adaptations that contribute to the pathoetiology of PTOA."
"9572749","This is a renewal of a highly synergistic PPG exploring tolerance induction for xenotransplantation. Themes include: 1) Tolerance of the adaptive immune system; 2) Overcoming innate immune barriers; and 3) Using advanced genetic engineering techniques to improve genetically modified (GM) MGH inbred miniature swine. In Project 1, ?Achieving Xenograft Tolerance through Thymic Programming in Primates?, we will study and attempt to avoid the proteinuria which limits GalT-KO pig kidney transplant survival in baboons; we will optimize tolerance and protective immunity by transplanting a hybrid vascularized thymus (VT) containing pig and baboon TECs and combine this with mixed xenogeneic chimerism with intra-bone injection of pig bone marrow to simultaneously tolerize both adaptive and innate immunity. In Project 2, ?Achieving Xenograft Tolerance through Mixed Chimerism?, which also uses the pig-to-baboon model, we have achieved prolonged mixed chimerism in baboon recipients of human CD47 (hCD47) Tg pig hematopoietic cells (HCs), resulting in remarkably prolonged pig skin graft survival; we will combine this approach with intrabone injection of hCD47 Tg/hCD55 Tg/GalT KO pig hematopoietic cells and use ex-vivo expanded recipient Tregs to enhance engraftment, aiming to achieve more durable chimerism and, with it, tolerance of B, NK and T cells; we will also test HCs from new GM swine produced in Project 4. Project 3, ?Tolerance of Adaptive and Innate Human Anti-Pig Immune Responses in Humanized Mice?, combines mixed xenogeneic chimerism and porcine thymic transplantation in humanized mice with robust human immune systems; we will combine engineered pig/human hybrid thymi with mixed xenogeneic chimerism to achieve multi-faceted immune tolerance along with protective immunity for both human and porcine tissues; we will determine the impact of the hCD47 Tg on induction of porcine mixed chimerism in these mice and determine the impact of duration of this mixed chimerism on human T, B and NK cell tolerance. In Project 4, ?Improving Xenogeneic Chimerism and Tolerance through Genome Engineering Technology?, advanced genetic engineering techniques will be used to generate two optimal GM pig lines, one for tolerance induction and the other for organ transplantation, on a background of inbred miniature swine with common GMs that will be needed for both purposes. Core A will provide administrative support for the PPG, facilitating interactions between the primary and subcontract sites. Core B will support all large animal needs, including non-human primates and GM MGH inbred miniature swine; provide support for infectious diseases, coagulation and clotting issues of swine and baboons; and provide mAbs and antisera. The synergism of these projects and cores and the fertile interactions among them should bring us closer to the goal of clinical xenotransplantation."
"9439688","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer cachexia, the unintentional loss of bodyweight and muscle mass, directly impacts patient survival and quality of life. The role of skeletal muscle in maintaining health, for cancer patients and healthy individuals, involves both the amount of muscle mass and the quality of the muscle, as it relates to metabolic capacity and substrate utilization flexibility. Although understanding muscle mass loss is a major focus of cachexia research, reduced muscle quality likely plays a role in both cachexia progression and mass loss. Understanding how the cancer patient's systemic environment disrupts both muscle metabolism and protein turnover regulation remains a challenge that is substantial enough to have impeded cancer cachexia treatment. Inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and muscle STAT signaling are clear regulators of muscle wasting in tumor-bearing mice. Muscle protein synthesis through mTOR is also suppressed in cachectic muscle. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the IL-6 regulation of suppressed muscle anabolic signaling with cancer cachexia. This proposal mechanistically extends our published and preliminary data examining IL-6 regulation of muscle protein turnover during the progression of cachexia. Our long-term goal is to improve cancer patient survival through understanding inflammatory, metabolic and hormonal signaling pathway interactions that disrupt muscle protein synthesis. Our study's overall objective is to mechanistically understand how the IL-6 family of cytokines can regulate nutrient, hormonal, and mechanical control of muscle protein turnover during the initiation and progression of cachexia in ApcMin/+ and Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) implanted mice. Our central hypothesis is that muscle protein synthesis suppression through mTOR signaling is fundamental for cachexia- induced muscle mass loss. The rationale for this proposed research is that the identification of metabolic signaling pathways and the inflammatory regulators of these processes will allow therapeutic countermeasures that can block or reverse the progression of muscle wasting with cancer. Guided by our prior research and preliminary data using ApcMin/+ and LLC mouse cachexia models, we plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives of this application with three specific aims: 1) Identify the IL-6 regulation of protein synthesis and mTOR signaling necessary for anabolic resistance to feeding and exercise during the progression of cachexia; 2) Determine if alterations in muscle oxidative metabolism regulate mTOR signaling and protein synthesis during the progression of cachexia; and 3) Determine if suppressed testosterone and androgen-associated signaling regulate mTOR signaling and protein turnover during the progression of cachexia. This research is innovative because it will examine mechanical, metabolic, and hormonal signaling pathways that are regulated by chronic systemic inflammation and control mTOR-signaling regulation of muscle protein synthesis with cachexia. It is significant because the results will lead to developing physical activity and pharmaceutical interventions that can intervene in the progression of muscle wasting with cancer."
"9431218","PROJECT SUMMARY  Accumulation of toxic lipid bisretinoids (LBs) in lysosomes (LY) of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a main etiological agent for recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1) and ABCA4-related forms of cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Furthermore, accumulation of LBs with age is a suspected risk factor for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Hence, agents that remove LBs from RPE fulfill an unmet medical need for STGD1, CRD, RP and may help validate LBs as pharmacological targets in AMD. We have recently identified beta cyclodextrins (?CDs), cyclic sugars formed by 7 glucose residues, as promising bioactive compounds capable of removing LB from RPE cultures, from enucleated eyecups obtained from ABCA4/RDH8 double knock out (DKO) mice (a mouse model for accelerated LB deposition) and from DKO mouse eyes after intravitreal (IVT) injection (Nociari et al. PNAS, 2014). ?CDs are known for their ability to solubilize free cholesterol (FC) from biological membranes and to clear aberrant storage materials in lysosomal storage disorders, including FC in Niemann-Pick C (NPC), ceroid lipofuscin in Batten Disease as well as ?-synuclein (?- syn) in Parkinson and amyloid-? in Alzheimer Disease. In NPC cells, clearance of FC depends on ?CDs' ability to form complex with FC. In contrast, their ability to clear ceroid lipofuscin and ?-syn, depends on their capacity to modulate transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of LY, peroxisomal and mitochondrial function and of autophagy. As with FC, ?CDs form soluble complexes with LBs; however, the underlying clearance mechanism is unknown. Elucidation of the mechanism mediating LB clearance from RPE will facilitate the therapeutic utilization of ?CDs for LB-induced retinal disease. Furthermore, to maximize the safety, potency and retinal biodistribution we propose to optimize nanoparticles (?CD-threaded polyrotaxanes) that have already shown effective ?CD delivery into LY of NPC cells. Finally, we will test the efficacy of ?CD-based approaches alone or in combination with TFEB-based strategies in ABCA4RDH8-/- mice, an animal model of LB-driven retinal degeneration. Because ?- CDs are FDA approved, success in this proposal could be quickly extended into clinical trials in humans."
"9628377","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate Career Goals: Dr. Ernest R. Vina's long-term career goal is to promote equity for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases through the development of interventions to eliminate racial disparities and improve outcomes for patients with these diseases. With his research and clinical experience in addressing the sources of racial disparities in the health and health care of patients with rheumatic diseases, Dr. Vina is well-suited to build a research career in this area. However, he will require additiona training and skills in order to address knowledge gaps by exploring patient characteristics and health beliefs that may contribute to disparities in the medical care of patients with osteoarthrits (OA). Dr. Vina's short-term career goals are 1) to develop the expertise required to study the reasons why race disparities in the use of different types of non-surgical OA treatment exist; and 2) to learn to develop an intervention and implement a clinical trial to reduce racial disparities n the use of various OA treatments. Research Background: OA is a highly prevalent and disabling disease. Racial disparities in the outcomes of OA patients have also been demonstrated, with African-Americans (AAs) carrying a greater burden than whites (WHs). In addition, AAs are also less likely to have history of use of various pharmacologic and non- pharmacologic therapies for OA. Sources of racial healthcare disparities in OA are only partially known. Research Aims: There are two main aims for this K23. The first is to examine the determinants of, and barriers to, the utilization of various OA treatments that contribute to disparities in the care of AAs and WHs. The second is to pilot-test the impact of an intervention designed to improve the utilization of effective, non- surgical OA treatments. Methods: To achieve the goals of the first aim, surveys of patients with knee or hip OA will be conducted. The survey will determine patient demographic information, psychosocial characteristics, disease severity, treatment history and health-related knowledge, beliefs and attitudes. The primary outcomes of interest will include utilization of various treatments, including exercises, topical medications, non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs and opioid agents. Hierarchical statistical modeling will be conducted to determine which patient-level variables may mediate racial disparities in the utilization of the various OA treatments. For the second aim, an existing educational tool will be chosen and enhanced with the goal of improving patient understanding of OA treatments and increasing the use of available OA therapies. Thereafter, this instrument will be pilot-tested to a relatively smal group of patients with knee or hip OA. The impact of this educational tool in improving the utilization of various OA therapies will be preliminarily determined."
"9467560","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric dysphagia-chronic difficulty with feeding and swallowing-is a serious complication in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Dysphagia can be recognized in between 35% and 80% of newborns, infants and older children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and the incidence is currently increasing. The consequences of pediatric dysphagia include failure to gain weight, malnutrition, acute choking, food aspiration and naso-sinus, middle ear, and lung aspiration related infections including pneumonia. Current therapies aim at relieving symptoms or modifying food to ease difficulties; however, there are neither cures nor preventive strategies for pediatric dysphagia. The lack of new approaches reflects a lack of fundamental understanding of neural and oro-pharyngeal mechanisms that are disrupted in pediatric dysphagia, and their developmental causes. Our research program will provide this fundamental understanding by defining the pathology, developmental origins, and approaches for prevention of pediatric dysphagia. Our goal is to provide a new foundation for better diagnosis and therapy for dysphagia in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders and new clinically tractable approaches for preventing or diminishing dysphagia. Achieving this goal is now possible because our group has established the first genetically defined, behaviorally and pathologically validated model of pediatric dysphagia. We have found that the LgDel mouse model of 22q11 Deletion Syndrome, a genetic deletion neurodevelopmental disorder in which at least 45% of affected children have pediatric dysphagia, accurately recapitulates key dysphagic features: LgDel mouse pups fail to gain weight, aspirate milk acutely, and have a high incidence of naso-sinus, middle ear, and lung inflammation and infection. We will now use this powerful research tool to determine contributions of disrupted brainstem neural circuits versus oro-pharyngeal mechanics to pediatric dysphagia (PROJECT 1), how the pathology of pediatric dysphagia arises during development of the embryonic hindbrain (PROJECT 2), and how neural circuit or oro-pharyngeal pathology can be prevented by restoring disrupted development to normal status via maternal nutrition (PROJECT 3). These three projects will be supported by a core for administration (CORE A), animal models and dysphagia pathology (CORE B), genomics and bioinformatics (CORE C), and microscopic imaging and analysis (CORE D). Our research team has established expertise in cellular neurobiology, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, developmental biology, genetics and genomics. We will work closely with our clinical partners at Children's National Health System to maximize translation of our results to viable new therapies for children with dysphagia. Thus, we are uniquely positioned to undertake the first truly integrated biological mechanistic analysis of pediatric dysphagia. Our results will be transformative: they will define new diagnostic criteria, therapies, and prevention strategies to improve the vital capacity of feeding and swallowing in children with neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9523811","The main theme of the research is to develop new methodologies for resolving statistical issues emerging from our team?s long-term collaborations in cohort studies of aging populations and patients with kidney disease. We focus on developing robust and efficient estimating procedures for regression parameters from data with delayed entry in prevalent cohort studies, making appropriate and efficient statistical inference when covariates are subject to censoring and measurement error, and developing new strategies that best model the effects of terminal events on longitudinal measurements. We also plan to develop publicly available statistical software with the goal of dissemination and generalization. The proposed approach for delayed entry is based on an augmented conditional likelihood constructed from truncation times without specifying the truncation distribution, which leads to a more efficient estimator. The proposed approach for regression models for longitudinal data with censored covariates addresses some serious issues with the common nonparametric and parametric methods. For example, the nonparametric methods cannot recover any tail information for the censored covariates due to limit of detection, while the parametric methods may yield biased results due to model misspecification. Our method will facilitate investigation of covariates subject to limit of detection together with measurement error, reflecting the reality of many lab measures. The proposed statistical models for longitudinal data with the occurrence of a terminal event reflect the reality that the relationship between a response variable and covariates is approximately the same as the usual marginal model (without considering terminal event) when data are observed far from the terminal event, but becomes heavily dependent on the terminal event time when data collecting time is close to the terminal event. These methods are motivated from and will be applied to a wide range of datasets, including the kidney disease progression data, the kidney transplant registry data, the women?s health longitudinal data collected from the Michigan Bone Health and Metabolism Study and the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, and the longitudinal end stage renal disease medical cost data. The methods will be widely applicable to problems in many other fields of biomedical research."
"9529773","Project Summary  Alzheimer?s disease (AD) causes progressive loss of memory, for which there is no cure. Although genetic studies initially suggested a primary role for amyloid-? (A?) in Alzheimer?s disease, treatment strategies targeted at reducing A? failed to reverse memory loss. A growing understanding of cognitive impairment in AD suggests that alterations at the genetic and cellular levels contribute to circuit dysfunction, which affects long- range network connectivity. Inhibitory interneuron dysfunction in the cortical and hippocampal regions has recently been implicated to contribute to memory deficits in the mouse models of AD. In this application, we will focus on a septo-hippocampal inhibitory network involving medial septum (MS) GABAergic projection neurons and hippocampal interneurons as a susceptibility node because septo-hippocampal GABAergic network is well- known to be responsible for generating hippocampal theta rhythm and is important for memory and cognition. Furthermore, our recent data demonstrated that selective ablation of MS GABAergic neurons leads to hippocampal network hyperexcitability and impaired hippocampal theta rhythm, two key features of AD, suggesting that loss of MS GABAergic neurons are necessary to cause hippocampal network dysfunction. Importantly, optogenetic activation of septo-hippocampal GABAergic projections in acute brain slices increases GABAergic inputs onto the hippocampal principle cells, suggesting that activation of septo-hippocampal GABAergic circuit might be able to counteract AD-associated hippocampal hyperexcitability. These data together suggest that septo-hippocampal GABAergic network may represent an AD-susceptible node thus playing critical roles in the pathophysiological and functional cascade of AD. We will test the overall hypothesis that septo-hippocampal GABAergic circuit connections are impaired in AD, and chronic stimulation of the septo-hippocampal GABAergic circuit can alleviate AD pathology, counteract hippocampal hyperexcitability, and restore hippocampal theta rhythm. We will use a triple transgenic mouse model of AD harboring Tau, PS2, and APP which has been shown to exhibit region and cell-type specific degeneration of GABAergic neurons in both MS and hippocampus. We will characterize the anatomical and functional connections of septo- hippocampal GABAergic network (Aim 1) and evaluate the effects of chronic septo-hippocampal circuit activation on AD pathology and hippocampal activity (Aim 2) using a combination of circuit-based tracing approaches and in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology. These studies will guide new therapeutic directions by selectively targeting AD-vulnerable neural circuits and network for treating memory loss."
"9517344","Project Summary: Over 90% of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from speech problems characterized by impairments of voice and articulation, collectively termed ?hypokinetic dysarthria?. These symptoms degrade speakers' functional communication through decreases in both naturalness and intelligibility. However, little is known about the relationship between these functional communication outcomes and their underlying neural sensorimotor bases. While previous work has evaluated disparate aspects of speech motor control in modest cohorts, the result thus far is a patchwork of seemingly conflicting information. To address this gap, this project will comprehensively examine the sensorimotor control of speech in PD in a single cohort, utilizing the DIVA model [34] as a theoretical framework to guide hypothesis development and allow for mechanistic interpretations of experimental findings. Feedback and feedforward mechanisms of speech motor control affecting both voice (larynx) and articulation (vocal tract) will be evaluated in 40 individuals with PD and 40 matched control speakers using behavioral and neural responses to perturbations in somatosensory and auditory feedback. Our primary hypotheses are that PD involves weaker-than-normal feedforward commands, leading to increased reliance on feedback control, as well as an impaired ability to update feedforward commands based on discrepancies between desired and actual movement outcomes. Comprehensive sensorimotor control parameters from each participant will be compared with their intelligibility and naturalness, determined through rigorous auditory- perceptual experiments. Identification of the specific sensorimotor bases of speech symptoms in PD are essential to guide the development of new therapeutic targets to improve communication. For instance, although speech therapy is the only current treatment, only 13% of patients with PD choose to pursue it, likely due to its low long-term effectiveness. Given the relatively slow progression of PD and the increased incidence of speech symptoms with disease progression, developing effective speech treatments is imperative for maintaining quality of life. This project will result in specific physiological markers that are linked to functional communication outcomes in PD and can act as critical targets for behavioral and surgical interventions. This will lead to new treatments that are specific, effective, and tied to functional communication outcomes."
"9457442","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our accurate vision depends on the flow of visual information through precisely wired synaptic connections among axons and dendrites of retinal neurons with unique morphological and functional properties. In the vertebrate retina, each of the six neuronal cell types: ganglion, amacrine, bipolar, horizontal, and rod and cone photoreceptor cells are further divided into subtypes based on location, morphology and function. Of all retinal neurons, amacrine cells are the most diverse group with >30 subtypes being identified so far. They represent ~40% of neurons both in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and the ganglion cell layer (GCL), make up a majority of synapses in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and contribute to a majority of visual processing in the retina.  One of the key questions i how the many retinal neuronal subtypes are produced and wired during development. In this proposal, we focus on the amacrine cells associated with the sublaminar layer 3 (S3) of the IPL. The S3 sublamina separates the ON and OFF laminas in the IPL but its cellular makeup and function is poorly understood. Here, we have demonstrated LHX9, a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, is expressed early in retinogenesis and its expression is tightly confined toa few amacrine cells in the INL and the GCL. In our preliminary study, we have shown that these LHX9+ cells are a subgroup of GABAergic amacrine cells and express GAD67 but not GAD65. LHX9-expressing cells are also LHX2-expressing subgroup of amacrine cells. Targeted deletion of Lhx9 in mice results in a nearly complete loss of these LHX2-expressing amacrine cells and strikingly, in the absence of the S3 sublamina, suggesting that LHX9 could be expressed in and be required for the development of a unique, S3-stratifying amacrine subtype cells. Interestingly, our preliminary data show that bNOS expression is significantly down-regulated in the Lhx9-null retina, suggesting a loss of bNOS-subtype of amacrine cells that are known to project in the S3 sublamina. Being a transcription factor with a known function in neuronal subtype development in the central nervous system, LHX9 likely plays a critic role in amacrine subtype specification and offers us a unique opportunity to ultimately elucidate the genetic pathway governing the formation of the S3 sublamina and its associated neural circuitry. In this proposal, we will fully characterize the subtype identity of these LHX9-expressing amacrine subtypes and will identify its circuitry within the retina. Second, we will analyze the retinal defects of Lhx9-null mutation, particularly the effect on amacrine subtype specification, differentiation of these Lhx9-expressing S3 stratifying amacrine cells, and the change in the functional properties and circuitry of the Lhx9-lineage cells. To elucidate the LHX9 regulatory pathway in the S3-stratifying amacrine cells, we will perform RNA-Seq of control and Lhx9-null retinas and use LHX9 ChIP-Seq to screen for downstream target genes of LHX9 and to identify the transcriptional network. Together, these studies will define the role of LHX9 in regulating the formation and neural circuitry of S3 sublamina and elucidate the transcriptional events that occur downstream of LHX9."
"9447246","Abstract  This project aims to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying HIV capture and transmission by dendritic cells (DCs) using an improved humanized mouse model.  HIV invades the human body via mucosal surfaces or blood, however it only actively replicates in lymph nodes. It is generally accepted that HIV transmission from invasion site to replicating site depends on DCs, which are antigen presenting cells uniquely potent in initiating T cell immunity. DCs capture antigens in the periphery and migrate to the lymphoid organs where they process and present the antigens to and activate T cells. HIV hijacks these features of DCs for its viral transmission. DCs distribute in the mucosa and blood where HIV invades the human body and are thus the primary target of HIV. In vitro studies show that DCs can bind HIV via multiple receptors, retain the viral infectivity and transmit the virus to T cells that are activated during DC-T cell interaction, thereby amplifying viral productive replication. These studies, together with DCs' superior migration ability, leads to a general idea that HIV exploits DCs as a Trojan horse for entry into the lymph nodes and transmission to T cells, a process yet to be recapitulated in vivo.  It is known that HIV can bind to cells through several receptors including CD4 and CCR5. Another fascinating HIV receptor is DC-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), a receptor with multiple ligands and thus multiple functions. DC-SIGN, first identified on monocyte-derived DCs, is especially interesting because it not only mediates HIV capture and transmission but also controls DC migration, thus bridging invasion and replication of the virus. It does so by binding different ligands on HIV envelope (gp120), blood vessels (ICAM-2) and T cells (ICAM3) respectively. Importantly, DC-SIGN expression is not homogeneous on all DCs in vivo. It has been shown that microbial stimuli increases DC-SIGN+ DC numbers and DC-SIGN expression level, which suggests that environments with microbial stimuli amplify DC-SIGN mediated antigen capture. Might this, for example, help explain why circumcision, which dramatically reduces the bacterial load in the male genital area is correlated with reduced risk of HIV infection? If DC-SIGN and DCs serve as molecular and cellular links between microbial stimuli and HIV transmission, then it suggests two important questions: (a) Can microbial stimuli affect the HIV binding and the migration of these DCs in vivo? (b) Which DC subsets bind HIV in vivo and do they depend on DC- SIGN for binding and migration? Understanding these dynamic processes could prove crucial to designing strategies to prevent HIV transmission through targeting DC and DC-SIGN. We hypothesize that microbial stimuli increase recruitment and migration of DC-SIGN+ DCs in humans, thereby increasing DC-SIGN mediated HIV binding and transmission. To test this hypothesis, we will perform experiments with the following three specific aims. Aim 1. Optimize the humanized mouse model and determine reconstitution efficiency and HIV receptor expression in the steady state and in response to microbial stimuli. We will (1.1) determine how transplant of human thymus and fetal liver CD34+ cells, and Flt3L injection affect the reconstitution efficiency of DC and T cells in NSG-SGM3 recipient, (1.2) measure expression of multiple HIV receptors on different DC subsets in different tissues in humanized mice, and (1.3) assess alteration of DC population in response to injection of LPS, a microbial stimulus. AIM 2. Genetic targeting of DC-SIGN in humanized mouse and its effect on DC development and function. We will (2.1) compare shRNA and CRISPR/CAS9 strategies for their efficiency of transduction and knockdown of DC-SIGN in humanized mice, (2.2) evaluate how DC-SIGN knockdown affects development and migration of DCs and their interaction with T cells in humanized mouse, and (2.3) evaluate the development and migration of DCs and their interaction with T cells in humanized mouse lacking DC-SIGN in response to microbial stimuli. AIM 3. Determine gp120 binding to multiple DC subsets in vivo with absence and deficiency of DC-SIGN. We will (3.1) determine binding of gp120 to DCs with DC-SIGN presence or deficiency in vitro, (3.2) determine binding of gp120 to distinct DC subsets in vivo in the steady state and in response to LPS, and (3.3) determine how DC-SIGN knockdown affects binding of gp120 to DCs in vivo."
"9468475","PROJECT SUMMARY Relapse to drug abuse is the single greatest challenge in addiction treatment. Relapse can occur even after prolonged abstinence and is often preceded by robust drug craving precipitated by exposure to drug-paired stimuli and environments. However, presently little is known about the neural substrates that mediate drug craving and relapse. The long-term goal of this project is to characterize the corticostriatal neural network dynamics that accompany cocaine craving and relapse with an emphasis on their modulation by the endocannabinoid system. The current aims of this proposal are to examine the longitudinal development of potentiated corticostriatal circuit representations of cocaine-paired stimuli and their necessity in promoting cocaine-seeking behavior in rats; to assess whether environmental enrichment (wheel running) diminishes recruitment of mPFC-NAc network encoding of cocaine-paired stimuli as well as cocaine seeking; and, finally, to investigate whether augmenting accumbal activity-dependent, synapse-specific endocannabinoid levels attenuates heightened mPFC-NAc network dynamics and cocaine-seeking behavior. It is hypothesized that (1) cocaine-motivated behavior during extended forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration will be mediated by heightened recruitment of mPFC-NAc network activity and (2) exposure to environmental enrichment during forced abstinence as well as pharmacological enhancement of accumbal endocannabinoid neurotransmission will attenuate mPFC-NAc network encoding of cocaine-paired stimuli and cocaine seeking. These experiments will employ a sophisticated rat model of drug craving and relapse, state-of-the-art in vivo multi-unit electrophysiological recordings, chemogenetic technologies, and novel pharmacological agents to examine these questions in behaving animals. The proposed experiments aim to increase our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms that mediate drug craving and may improve our potential to predict relapse vulnerability and identify effective pharmacological and behavioral therapies."
"9527183","Summary Mental illness is a major public health concern in the U.S. and a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Racial and ethnic minority patients experience disproportionate burdens of common physical health conditions associated with mental illness, largely due to the lack of health care access and social stigma. Effectively treating mental illness and the associated conditions will depend on a comprehensive approach that crosses health systems and policies, such as the Community Benefit State Laws, to target ?Population Health? and emphasize the value of social determinants of health. However, the current mental health care system works in a silo, and evidence of care coordination on health disparities is lacking. The goal of this study is to examine system-level care coordination among hospitals, communities, and public health agencies, and to estimate its impacts on unmet health care needs in African American and Latino patients with mental illness. The rationale for the proposed research is that once it is known what specific coordination practices (e.g. medical services, transportation, public housing) and policies are most successful for different patient populations, integration of mental and physical health care delivery systems can be designed in a more cost-effective way to overcome the barriers from stigma and limited health care access. In this project, we will first determine the effects of Community Benefit State Laws on racial and ethnic disparities in health care access, quality, and costs among people with mental illness (Aim 1). Within this context, we will further identify the variation of hospital-based adoption of care coordination practices and its correlation with patient and community level socio- demographics, local public health resources, and the extent of the implementation of community benefit laws (Aim 2); and determine the impact of care coordination practices between hospitals, communities, and public health agencies on racial and ethnic health disparities (Aim 3). We will use mixed methods: (1) we will construct a multi-level data set by linking multiple nationally representative data sets and use difference-in- differences approach to estimate the impact of system-level care coordination on different racial/ethnic groups; and (2) we will investigate challenges to implementing system-level coordination using focus groups of racial and ethnic minority patient representatives, hospital administrators and providers, and representatives from public health agencies. The proposed research is significant because (1) identified practices are expected to provide evidence on how to personalize mental health care coordination for racial and ethnic minority patients to address heterogeneous preferences in mental health treatment; (2) identified system-level care coordination practices are expected to be cost-effective, which in turn can make the coordination sustainable for underserved populations. Our results are expected to break down longstanding silos and bridge the gap between health care providers, community based organizations, social service agencies, and the public health sector delivery system, in addition to providing evidence to reduce health disparities through care coordination."
"9472575","Project Summary/Abstract Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has shown tremendous promise for enabling heart tissue repair after ischemic injury. The therapeutic effects of stem cells are mediated by paracrine factors. Several studies illustrate that exosomes (EXO) derived from stem cells play a critical role in stem cell mediated therapy of ischemic myocardium via increasing angiogenesis. From the translational perspective, EXO have greater salutary therapeutic effects than whole cells: EXO have fewer potential adverse effects, less immune rejection, are more amenable to manipulation, and EXO cargo can be modified by preconditioning or genetic manipulation. GATA- 4, a cardiac transcription factor, promotes cardiac morphogenesis, extends cardiomyocyte (CM) survival and preserves cardiac function via regulating various bioactive molecules and activating cardiac protective miRs. Our published data indicate that MSC overexpressing GATA-4 (MSCGATA-4) increase MSC survival, protect native CM and promote angiogenesis, compared to vector-transfect MSC (MSCnull). EXO derived from EXO derived from GATA-4 overexpressing GATA-4 (ExoGATA-4) are more efficient than EXO from vector-transfected MSC (Exonull) in protecting CM from ischemic injury. In our pilot study, ExoGATA-4 are enriched with pro-angiogenic miRs, which regulate vascularization. ExoGATA-4 downregulate the expression of thrombospondin 1, a well-known endogenous inhibitor of neovascularization. The overarching goal of this project is to exploit effectiveness of GATA-4 conferred EXO than the ordinary EXO in repairable effects of ExoGATA-4. Our central hypothesis is that the ExoGATA-4 are enriched with pro-angiogenic miRs and proteins that are transferred into recipient cells and active multiple signaling pathways, leading to angiogenesis and cardiac repair. Three Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1, to determine the role of miRs carried by EXO in response to GATA-4 transfection. Aim 2, to demonstrate if the transferred bioactive molecules play a critical role in ExoGATA-4 mediated angiogenesis. Aim 3, to test the hypothesis that EXO derived from GATA-4 overexpressing MSCs are more effective than that from vector-transfected MSCs in promoting angiogenesis and myocardial regeneration. The proposed studies are innovative because no previous study has systematically examined the effectiveness of ExoGATA-4, with particular focus on the efficacy of EXO mediated angiogenesis and ischemic heart repair following systemic administration. Intravenous injection offers the advantage of enabling repeated treatments without the stress of repeated intramyocardial injections. The proposed study is highly significant because it will evaluate the concept that the effectiveness of cellular therapy can be reproduced by cell-free EXO and will explore this new modality for future clinical application by intravenous administration. This project will be the first systematic effort aimed at developing a completely new strategy in use of EXO administration in lieu of cells, which would revolutionize cell therapy. The outcome will offer a transformative validation and guide translational research and putative therapies based on enhanced angiogenic properties of EXO from genome-edited MSCs. 1"
"9497141","Summary/Abstract  Current knowledge about megakaryocyte (MK) gene expression has focused largely on transcription, whereas translational processes are relatively poorly understood in the healthy state, and even less is known in disease states. Dysregulated microRNAs (miRs) play a critical role in inflammation and the pathogenesis of several human bone marrow diseases, and over-expression and knockout studies in mice have identified miRs that induce myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs). Nevertheless, the role of miRs in MK gene expression in hu- man health or disease remains poorly understood. This research will use in vivo, in vitro, biochemical and bio- informatic approaches to study miR regulation of normal and stress (IFN?)-induced MK gene expression. In our preliminary data, we identified miRs strongly associated with platelet count and function in 154 healthy do- nors. Knockdown and over-expression studies showed miR-125a-5p regulates proplatelet formation (PPF) and miR-15a-5p regulates GPVI-induced MK integrin activation in cultured MKs, and that both miRs are pre- dicted to target genes expressed in primary human bone marrow MKs. We hypothesize that these miRs regu- late in vivo megakaryocytopoiesis (MKpoiesis) and platelet production and function. Aim 1 will test this hy- pothesis in vivo using MK-specific ablation of miR-125a and miR-15a, as well as parenteral administration of anti-miRs, using assays of platelet production, Mkpoiesis, and GPVI-mediated platelet reactivity, thrombus formation and signaling. To understand how miRs function it is critical to know their mRNA targets. Until re- cently, the approaches for identifying miR targets have been based on computer algorithms with high false positive and false negative prediction rates, such that additional biochemical data is needed. We hypothesize that only Argonaute 2 (Ago)-bound miRs function in platelet production and function. Aim 2 will identify and characterize miR-125a-5p and miR-15a-5p mRNA targets in living MKs using an unbiased, transcriptome-wide approach called Ago-HITS-CLIP (high throughput sequencing of cross-linked argonate2 immunoprecipitates). Novel miR-mRNA pairs will be validated in cells and seed regions queried for functional SNPs using public GWAS data sets of cardiovascular disease. Our RNA-seq preliminary data demonstrate IFN?-stimulated cul- tured MKs regulates miR and mRNA expression, and we hypothesize that IFN?-regulated miRs are associated with IFN? responsiveness in MPDs. In Aim 3 we will perform Ago-HITS-CLIP on IFN?-treated hematopoietic progenitor and differentiating MKs and test for associations between IFN?-inducible miRs and hematologic re- sponse in IFN?-treated patients with MPDs. The major impact of this research will be to (1) provide insights into the roles of miR-125a-5p and miR-15a-5p in platelet production and function, (2) characterize active miRs in living normal and IFN?-stimulated MKs, and (3) lay groundwork for using miRs to enhance in vitro manufac- ture of platelets, as potential therapeutic targets for thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis, and for mechanistic studies on pathogenic miRs in MPDs."
"9442734","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In the United States, there are 44 million smokers and about 500,000 tobacco related deaths yearly. The 2014 Surgeon General's Report stated, ? The burden of death and disease from tobacco use in the United States is overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and other combusted tobacco products; rapid elimination of their use will dramatically reduce this burden.? Although comprehensive tobacco control measures have had a significant impact in reducing smoking, because nearly 1 out 5 Americans still smoke, novel tobacco control approaches to reduce combusted tobacco product use are needed. One of the most powerful tools granted to the Food and Drug Administration through the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act is the authority to establish product standards, which includes standards for nicotine to render the cigarette minimally addictive. This regulatory policy could have a profound impact on public health by minimizing the transition from experimental cigarette use to dependence, facilitating quit attempts, and reducing the occurrence of relapse. To date, studies conducted examining the effects of reducing nicotine to very low levels (e.g., 0.4 mg/g nicotine) are promising and show a reduction in smoking and dependence relative to normal nicotine content cigarettes and an increase in quit attempts. However, the majority of these studies, although strong experimentally, were not conducted in the context of a complex marketplace and as such the results from these studies may not adequately represent the full public health impact of reducing nicotine in cigarettes. For example, these studies provided study cigarettes at no cost, discouraged the use of other tobacco or nicotine products, blinded smokers to the dose of nicotine and had restrictive inclusion criteria. Project 1 will circumvent these limitations, simulating the ?real world? environment by providing participants access to an experimental marketplace where they will be given vouchers that can be exchanged for study cigarettes (varying in nicotine content) and non-combusted tobacco/nicotine products or cash, by informing participants about the nicotine content in cigarettes, and by broadening the criteria for study inclusion. More specifically, subjects (N=350 in each group) will be randomly assigned to: 1) very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNC; 0.4 mg/g) along with non-combusted tobacco/nicotine products or 2) normal nicotine content cigarettes (NNC; 15.8 mg/g) along with non- combusted tobacco/nicotine products. We hypothesize that the VLNC cigarette condition will lead to: 1) greater use of non-combusted products; 2) fewer cigarettes smoked; 3) less exposure to tobacco- related toxicants; and 4) greater number of days of cigarette abstinence. We also hypothesize that VLNC will be associated with less positive effects than NNC, and greater positive effects of alternative non-combusted products than in the NNC condition. Finally, we hypothesize that specific groups of smokers will be more likely to seek and use non-combusted products (e.g., male, more dependent on cigarettes). This project will complement Projects 2 and 3 by examining, in a naturalistic rather than mechanistic fashion, the type of alternative product characteristics sought by smokers randomized to VLNC and NNC cigarettes and subject characteristics that might influence use of and responses to a multiple tobacco product marketplace."
"9535692","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Suicide, a primary cause of death among middle-aged men (35-64 years old), is the leading cause of injury death among men in this age group in Michigan (state where study takes place). Reliance on traditional mental health services to reach out to and engage men in this age group has not resulted in increased suicide problem recognition or help-seeking behavior. While effective treatment for suicide exists, treatment cannot help men who don't identify as having a problem, and therefore don't see help. The field lacks effective and efficient programs and interventions that actively engage middle-aged men in evidence-based interventions to increase suicide problem identification and help-seeking behavior. We will examine the effectiveness of a comprehensive online screening and referral intervention, specifically designed for men ages 35-64. Primary outcomes include suicide behavior (suicide attempts and preparatory acts), suicide ideation and depression. Secondary outcomes include: attitudes toward help-seeking and help-seeking behavior; suicide risk factors (i.e., alcohol abuse, relationship conflicts, financial problems and interpersonal needs7); and the protective factor of social support. Men who score in the moderate-to-high risk range for depression on the depression screen, or any score for suicide ideation and/or behavior on the suicide screen, will be asked to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Screening for Mental Health; or Screening for Mental Health, plus Man Therapy. Man Therapy is specifically designed for men who are at risk for suicide and less likely to engage in help-seeking behavior. A series of data analysis techniques will be used to evaluate the additive effect of Man Therapy. The core analysis will be a longitudinal mixed-model path analysis testing for between-group and within-group differences on primary and secondary outcomes. The model design will also include estimations of indirect effects (mediation and moderation). Data will be collected on primary outcomes of depression and suicidal behavior and ideation at baseline and then again at 2- and 12-weeks post randomization to study arm. Secondary outcomes will be measured 2- and 12-weeks post randomization to study arm. Using a sequential mixed-methods research design, researchers will interview a purposive sub-sample of men referred to both study arms to further assess and compare barriers and facilitators to men seeking suicide prevention services. This innovative study, which can be widely applicable to other states across the country, may advance suicide prevention among middle-aged men, a high-risk group for suicide who tend to be difficult to engage in suicide problem identification and help-seeking behavior."

"9494290","Summary The long-term objective of this proposal is to spur the translation of basic scientific discoveries to new therapeutic strategies for a broad range of human afflictions. Northwestern University's High Throughput Analysis Laboratory (NU-HTA) is a well-established shared resource facility that supports development and execution of diverse projects that require highly parallel experiments. These include biochemical and cell- based screening of compound libraries to identify agents that modulate important biological processes, as well as large-scale analysis of gene function. NU-HTA's suite of analytical instruments includes sophisticated photometric plate readers, a high-content screening system and both microliter and nanoliter liquid handling systems. Essentially all research performed in this facility relies heavily on an Echo acoustic liquid handling system. The facility's current Echo platform is nine years old and has reached the end of its expected lifetime. The instrument has incurred increasingly expensive and time-consuming repairs in recent years and its central component, the acoustic transducer, is obsolete and can no longer be serviced. It is imperative that the current system be replaced. The acquisition of a new Echo Acoustic Liquid Handling System integrated with an Access Automated Plate Handling Platform will significantly enhance the facility's liquid handling capabilities and meet the research needs of NU-HTA's users. The Echo 555 system offers tremendous improvement in versatility and precision over competitive platforms. To ensure continued commission of this instrument, the University has pledged $110,000 to maintain the instrument as well as purchase compound libraries that will expand the user base. The University also provides supporting operational and fiscal management teams and infrastructure. Acquisition of the Echo system will allow seamless continuation of NIH-supported projects and spur the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, reproductive disorders, neuronal disorders including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and future endeavors."
"9486328","PROJECT SUMMARY ? PROJECT 2 For adults with schizophrenia, the transition from hospital inpatient to outpatient care poses substantial risks of treatment disengagement. Traditional case management approaches for patients with schizophrenia have involved telephonic follow-up after discharge from inpatient mental health care and have yielded poor results. Much less information exists regarding outcomes for patients with schizophrenia discharged following inpatient medical care. Given that these patients often have difficulty accessing and adhering to medical treatments, patients with schizophrenia who are admitted to a hospital for treatment of a medical condition are especially vulnerable to failed care transitions. Intensive interventions involving home visits, social support, motivational interviewing, and accompanying patients to outpatient appointments have shown positive results for patients discharged following inpatient mental health care, and may therefore be effective for patients with schizophrenia discharged following inpatient medical care. Critical Time Intervention (CTI) is a novel evidence- based time-limited intervention that involves ongoing community-based contacts with patients from trained care managers to facilitate connections to aftercare providers and community and support systems following hospital discharge. This pilot study will adapt CTI for use with patients with schizophrenia who are admitted to one of 2 safety net hospitals in Bronx, New York, for treatment of ambulatory care sensitive conditions (medical conditions for which appropriate ambulatory care should limit the need for inpatient treatment). We will randomize 80 eligible inpatients to receive either: 1) treatment as usual (TAU) (n=40); or 2) CTI and TAU (n=40). During a 3-month period prior to randomization, an Adaptation Team of research and hospital staff will review data from qualitative interviews of clinical staff and patients to identify factors likely to facilitate and impede CTI implementation. The team will then adapt the CTI to increase the likelihood of successful implementation. In the randomization phase, participants assigned to CTI will meet with a CTI care manger during their inpatient stay and over a 3-month period following hospital discharge. CTI care managers will assess and address patient needs and barriers to outpatient medical and mental health care and provide support and assistance with medical and mental health care management. For quantitative analyses, the primary outcome measures will be all-cause hospital readmissions at 7 and 30 days following discharge. Secondary outcomes will include follow-up with medical and mental health outpatient care at 7 and 30 days following hospital discharge. Patients receiving CTI will also be assessed to evaluate satisfaction with CTI services, psychiatric symptoms, community function, and involvement in medical care decisions. The proposed study will test whether a time-limited novel intervention helps overcome common barriers to adherence with outpatient medical and mental health care and reduces hospital readmissions for a vulnerable population."
"9490579","Abstract Alcohol consumption at hazardous levels is associated with negative consequences on nearly every step of the HIV care continuum. It is a critical factor in HIV treatment that, if unaddressed, significantly contributes to onward transmission and poor treatment outcomes. Alcohol interventions for people living with HIV (PLWH) in the United States (US) have shown mixed results, and no alcohol intervention for PLHW has shown long-term reductions in heavy drinking or a significant impact on HIV-related outcomes. One hypothesized reason for this limited success is the failure of these interventions to address the multiple overlapping problems (e.g., co- morbid mental health conditions, behavioral health needs) of PLWH who are hazardous drinkers. Innovative alcohol intervention strategies that can have an impact on these multiple behavioral health needs, in a format that can be feasibly delivered in the context of HIV care, are needed. Brief Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a promising intervention for HIV-infected hazardous drinkers. ACT is a transdiagnostic treatment that uses mindfulness skills and values-guided behavioral action plans to impact a broad array of psychological symptoms. ACT has shown efficacy for treatment of anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and substance use, making it a promising approach for hazardous drinkers. The overall objective of this application is to adapt an existing brief ACT intervention developed for smoking cessation, and pilot test its feasibility and acceptability for PLWH who are hazardous drinkers. We hypothesize that the resulting intervention will be preliminarily associated with decreased alcohol use, improved ART adherence, decreased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and drug use, and increased acceptance?a known mechanism of change in ACT. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1?we will adapt an existing brief ACT intervention for HIV-infected hazardous drinkers (ACT-AU). We will accomplish this aim by: Modifying a 5-session, telephone-delivered ACT intervention for smoking cessation via iterative multidisciplinary team meetings, focus group discussions with HIV clinic patients (N = 15-20), and qualitative interviews with HIV clinic providers (N = 5-10). Aim 2?we will conduct a pilot comparative effectiveness randomized clinical trial (RCT) of ACT-AU compared to a brief alcohol intervention previously shown to reduce drinking days among HIV-infected women. We will accomplish this aim by: Randomly assigning N = 74 HIV-infected hazardous drinkers (50% women) to the intervention developed in Aim 1, or a brief alcohol intervention similar in length and frequency of treatment sessions. We will assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary trial outcomes. Alcohol use and ART adherence will be assessed via both self-report and biomarkers at 6-weeks and 6-months post-randomization; preliminary changes in acceptance as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression, and drug use will also be examined 6- weeks and 3 and 6-months post-randomization. The proposed research will provide essential pilot data for a R01 application to conduct a full-scale RCT to determine the comparative efficacy of ACT-AU.  "
"9473215","Project Summary/Abstract Our group completed the natural history study of premanifest Huntington disease (HD) entitled Predict-HD which evaluated over 1400 research volunteers who were healthy but had undergone the predictive test for the gene that causes HD. Findings revealed that signs and symptoms of HD were evident up to 15 years before the traditional diagnosis of HD was given in the clinic. From these data we were able to develop models of prognosis, disease progression and prediction of HD onset. Disease-modifying clinical trials are currently underway to slow the progression, or delay the onset, of HD. More recently, a collaborative group published an assay to measure the amount of mutant huntingtin protein in the cerebral spinal fluid of HD participants. Questions of central importance to the success of this measure for clinical trials require investigation: (1) how reliable is the measure in the same person when repeated (intra-subject test-retest reliability); (2) how reliable is the measure in the same person when analyzed by two different labs (inter-lab reliability); (3) does the measure reflect disease symptoms (content validity); (4) does the measure predict meaningful disease outcomes (prognostic validity); (5) does the measure track disease progression or severity; and (6) how many (and what stage of HD) research subjects do we need to know with confidence that an intervention is w o r k i n g ( i . e . , delaying onset/slowing progression)? The proposed research study will address all of these limitations to more effectively test new experimental interventions such as gene therapies and new drugs. Findings will immediately inform how the field should best design preventive clinical trials for HD."
"9434122","The United States is battling an opioid abuse epidemic. More than 2 million individuals are addicted to prescription opioids, and the annual overdose rate from prescription and illicit opioids has quadrupled since 1999. There is an urgent need for safer, less addicting analgesic drugs and for drugs that antagonize opioid- induced adverse effects (e.g., respiratory depression). Mu opioid (mu) G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activation provides opioid-mediated analgesia. Endomorphin 1 and 2 are endogenous mu-selective opioid tetrapeptide agonists (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Phe-NH2 and Tyr-Pro-Phe-Phe-NH2), and rodent studies suggest these agents provide analgesia without the side effects of motor impairment, respiratory depression, or addiction. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) GPCR activation provides mild analgesia, hinders opioid tolerance, and stimulates breathing to reverse even deep levels of opioid-induced respiratory depression. Its endogenous agonist, TRH, is a processed tripeptide ((pyro)Glu-His-Pro-NH2). Both endomorphins and TRH peptides, unfortunately, have poor bioavailability due to proteolysis and poor blood brain barrier penetration. Cyclic peptides are a pharmacologic alternative to linear peptides with increased peptidase resistance, increased biologic activity due to rigid structures, and a potential for membrane permeability. In this project, we seek to identify novel cyclic peptide agonist of both the Mu and TRH GPCRs (Aim #1) with therapeutic potential for use as analgesics or breathing stimulant drugs. The new cyclic peptide agonists will be transiently expressed in mammalian cells using modified mRNA (modRNA) (Aim #2) as a novel means of prolonged cyclic peptide drug administration. We will use Split Intein-mediated Circular Ligation of Peptides and Proteins (SICLOPPS), an established system for cyclic peptide production, which relies on a DNA plasmid-encoded self-splicing protein, and which has been used successfully in yeast and mammalian cells. To identify cyclic peptide agonists, we will co-express a library of DNA-encoded cyclic peptides with the mu or TRH GPCRs in an established, engineered his3 auxotrophic yeast strain that responds to surface GPCR activation by growth in histidine-deficient media. We will use modRNA to express cyclic peptides for future in vivo therapeutic delivery. modRNA is mRNA that has been stabilized and made non-immunogenic and non- cytotoxic by substitution of uridine and cytidine with the modified nucleosides pseudouridine and 5- methylcytidine. modRNA provides rapid, robust, titrateable, and time limited in vivo protein production without concern for chromosomal integration in both dividing and non-dividing cells.  "
"9668351","Project Summary/Abstract Crude mortality has been used by the public health community as a cornerstone for defining a public health emergency. Typically mortality in emergencies is monitored by surveillance processes that are incomplete or surveys which are often done poorly and ignored where that is politically expedient. This project will attempt to establish two different techniques, both simpler than surveys, and less likely to be dismissed by critics. 1) The process of multiple source triangulation, or establishing the sensitivity of IDP and death tallies will draw upon methods used widely in TB programs and the monitoring of homeless populations in large cities, but is rarely used to assess mortality. This process of constructing a summary of all known deaths or IDP's, collecting an independent sample, and examining the overlap between the two listings can be rapid, and can potentially transcend the biases typical in death and registration records. The project will select places to enumerate and measure mortality in at least one population displaced by an acute disaster, and at least one population that is persecuted or associated with significant stigma'. 2) A statistically representative community-based surveillance network was established by RHA with the Ministry of Health in Fizi Health Zone, DRC. Community health workers recorded birth, death, and migration events. Preliminary analyses suggest that the surveillance system detected 93% of births and 87% of deaths, with a specificity >99% for both measures, and positive predictive values of 98% (births) and 91% (deaths). This project will attempt to see if a similar system can be established in the city of Goma, to monitor IDPs in an urban setting. While not applicable to all crises, IDPs in Nairobi and Jordan and other large urban centers where IDPs remain stable over months or years could potentially be monitored with this approach. Once established, collection of other desired information from a statistically representative sample could easily be added into the surveillance process. To maximize policy impact, the later years of the project will involve extensive coordination with CDC, OFDA, and other donors in an attempt to establish procedures for mortality measurement in the locations and with partners of priority to donors. Without a widespread and credible capacity to measure central outcomes like income, malnutrition, and mortality, funding of humanitarian emergencies will continue to be based more on political interests than on public health need, and successful life-saving relief operations will remain indistinguishable from ineffective efforts. By adding two new simple and inexpensive options to the toolbox of the humanitarian community, we can help develop a community focused on outcomes instead of processes."
"9500436","Project Summary  Liver cancers, both primary and metastatic, are increasing in incidence and are associated with significant mortality. Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) has been established as an effective, safe, and feasible first- line option in the local control of unresectable hepatic malignancies. Nonetheless, a large margin (typically ~1cm) has to be used in current liver SBRT to accommodate tumor positioning uncertainty under cone-beam CT (CBCT) image guidance. Because of respiratory motion and vanishing tumor contrast, the tumor target cannot be visualized in CBCT. Inferior tumor positioning approach based on anatomical or implanted surrogates are clinical standard, leading to substantial tumor position uncertainty and a typical margin size of ~1cm. Consequently, high dose to a large volume of normal tissue is delivered, causing a toxicity concern, especially in patients with liver dysfunction caused by cancer and/or treatments is more substantial. In addition, normal tissue toxicity limits further dose escalation to improve clinical benefits. This issue is expected to become more severe, when extending SBRT to a wider patient population, e.g. those with a large tumor size. Several emerging imaging approaches have showed potential to improve image guidance accuracy but also encountered challenges. To date, there is no approach that can provide accurate, reliable, and clinically translatable image guidance for liver SBRT. Recently, our group has made a breakthrough towards reconstructing elemental composition image using a standard CBCT platform. Employing a kVp-switching technique, a novel image reconstruction method with spatial and spectral image regularization, as well as a sparse-dictionary based element decomposition method, we achieved ~3% accuracy in elemental composition as tested in phantom studies. We have also accumulated extensive experience in reconstructing high-quality CBCT images under respiratory motion. Armed with these successes, the overall goal of this study is to develop a novel element-resolved and motion-compensated (ERMC-) CBCT to image iodine contrast agent using only 20% contrast injection in a standard treatment planning CT scan for precise (uncertainty <2mm) image guidance in liver SBRT. We will pursue three specific aims (SAs): SA1. Develop the overall ERMC- CBCT system. SA2. Optimize scan parameters via phantom studies. SA3. Perform studies in 10 patient cases to test safety, feasibility, and tumor positioning accuracy of ERMC-CBCT based image guidance. The innovation of this project is a novel ERMC-CBCT system and its application for a clinically significant problem of tumor localization in liver SBRT. Besides the significance of substantially improved localization accuracy and therefore clinical potential of normal tissue sparing and dose escalation, our project also holds the significance of utilizing CBCT to its maximal potential for many other advanced image guidance tasks and quantitative applications. The ERMC-CBCT system is developed on a conventional CBCT platform, the most widely available image-guidance platform in radiotherapy, ensuring its translatability."

"9452001","Category A filoviruses and arenaviruses cause severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever, for which no specific treatments or vaccines are available. Among the possible pre- and post-exposure treatments vetted, monoclonal antibodies are currently thought to be the most effective, provide the longest window for post-exposure treatment, and be most likely to achieve FDA approval for reasons of safety, availability and efficacy. In the last year, members of our team were first to identify specific antibodies and cocktails of antibodies that confer effective post-exposure protection against Ebola virus and Lassa virus in multiple animal models. We will translate these therapies and fill critical resource gaps in antibodies against other pathogenic filoviruses (Sudan, Marburg and Bundibugyo) and arenaviruses (Lujo, Machupo, Junin, etc.). this proposal describes a large, multidisciplinary consortium from academic and industrial investigators. We have gathered -315 monoclonal antibodies against the filoviruses and -100 monoclonal antibodies against the arenaviruses. These are the largest antibody pools ever assembled for these viruses and include the most potent antibodies known. The consortium includes directors of three BSL4 laboratories - experts in post exposure therapeutic development and evaluation; other leaders in high-throughput and human antibody discovery and analysis with access to unique, large cohorts of human survivors of outbreaks in 2012; structural biologists with intimate knowledge of the filovirus and arenavirus glycoproteins able to map the epitope of nearly every antibody in the pools during the course of the project; and industrial scientists who are experts in large-scale production and evaluation of therapeutics for human use. Our consortium is open to all investigators and to all antibodies they wish to contribute. We will provide a public, comprehensive and definitive analysis of which antibodies are most effective against these antibodies and why, which antibodies can be combined for greatest synergy and why, and which epitopes lead to broad-spectrum reactivity. The over-arching goal is to advance mAb-based immunotherapeutic products to fill the need for treatments against these families of viruses and to file one or more Investigational New Drug applications by year 5."
"9647769","ABSTRACT The technology that will be developed in this NIH SBIR Phase I and, later, Phase II proposal will provide novel systems for optical guidance of spinal surgery that will not use any of the expensive components currently used for surgical navigation, intra-operative CT or O-arm imaging or robotics. Instead, the technology will leverage innovative, new hardware such as optical head mounted displays (OHMD) with a low hardware cost, which have become recently available for gaming and industrial applications, against novel techniques of optically registering a patient and a surgical site using optical markers with defined shapes, dimensions and geometries. The system will not require the development or use of expensive imaging equipment in the operating room, but rather utilize existing fluoroscopic equipment available in every operating room in the U.S. By avoiding any of the expensive components of standard surgical navigation, O-arm imaging or intra-operative CT scanning, and robotics, the proposed technology can be made available at a fraction of the price of current systems for guiding spinal fusion for surgical planning. The preliminary data indicate that an accuracy of better than 2mm, possibly better than 1mm, can be achieved which is comparable to the clinical accuracy of current navigation and image guidance system. Novel techniques for further increasing the accuracy of optical registration using OHMD's in this proposal include among others:  - Geometric patterns for optical markers optimized for real-time optical detection and recognition using images from the  OHMD's video camera.  - Use of a priori knowledge of marker size and geometry to determine distance from the OHMD and orientation relative  to the OHMD.  - Shapes optimized for real-time detection using sensor information from the OHMD's depth camera.  - Software to register surgical instruments utilizing optical markers. Optical guidance with existing OHMD hardware and novel software and technology developed in this proposal paired with existing radiographic equipment in the operating room holds the promise to provide accurate intra-operative guidance in a highly cost-efficient manner at fraction of the price of existing navigation, intra-operative CT or O-arm imaging and robotic approaches. Unlike existing techniques, optical guidance using OHMD's and augmented reality display provide a unique advantage of greatly improved hand-eye coordination by accurately registering and superimposing both fluoroscopic image data and the intended path for the surgical instruments onto the surgical field and the corresponding anatomic landmarks, thereby offering a significant benefit over all current techniques. This unique approach has the potential to reduce deviation from the intended path and the possibility of even greater placement accuracy of pedicle screws resulting in less complications."
"9545166","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cocaine is a powerful inhibitor of catecholamine transporters and chronic use of cocaine alters catecholamine dependent functions. Numerous studies have documented dampened dopaminergic signaling and reward response in relation to habitual drug seeking. On the other hand, relatively little is known about how noradrenergic processes influence drug use. A growing body of evidence suggests impaired cognitive control and altered prefrontal activities as well as noradrenergic deficits in chronic stimulant misuse. For instance, we observed impaired prefrontal cortical activation during inhibitory control in cocaine dependent individuals. In a pharmacological study, methylphenidate improved inhibitory control by influencing prefrontal cortical activation. Furthermore, these regional brain effects manifest with functional connectivity to the locus coeruleus (LC), suggesting a noradrenergic mechanism.  Located in the midbrain, the LC provides the major source of noradrenergic inputs to the cerebral cortex and responds to salient stimuli to support arousal, attention and many other behavioral contingencies. However, the LC is a very small structure and exhibits low MR signals in conventional imaging. This limitation in spatial resolution and signal intensity may have hampered the research of LC in humans.  Here we propose to address this issue by combining neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to identify the LC and ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra (VTA/SN) and fMRI of cognitive control. By accurately locating the LC and VTA/SN for individual participants, we seek to examine whether and how the noradrenergic and dopaminergic mechanisms of cognitive control are compromised in cocaine addiction. Forty-eight abstinent cocaine dependent individuals (CD) and 48 demographics matched healthy control individuals (HC) will participate in fMRI during performance of a stop signal task as well as a neuromelanin sensitive scan in the same native space. We hypothesize diminished LC signal intensity and LC response to salient stimuli as well as altered LC prefrontal functional connectivity and prefrontal activations during cognitive control in CD as compared to HC.  We hope that the study will substantiate the role of noradrenergic circuits in an etiology of habitual drug use and facilitate the development of new therapeutic agents for cocaine addiction. If successful, the study may also have important implications for research of many other clinical conditions that implicate noradrenergic dysfunction."
"9575938","This proposal involves an upgrade of the Michael E. DeBakey VAMC (MEDVAMC) research magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner from the 3 Tesla Siemens Trio platform, which was purchased in 2008, to the Siemens 3 Tesla Prisma platform, which received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2013. The current MEDVAMC research Trio model has reached the limit of available upgrades to improve its research utility. However, rather than replacing the entire scanner, Siemens has enabled an upgrade process from Trio to the Prisma platform, whereby the core magnet is retained, but critical hardware and software that improve its functionality can be installed with relatively little downtime or costly and disruptive changes to building infrastructure. This cost-effective and efficient procedure allows continued use of the hardware elements that do not necessarily benefit from the upgrade and leverages the substantial investment already made by the hospital. The Prisma utilizes advances in increased gradient strength and improved parallel receive technology, which result in the capacity to acquire higher-resolution images at faster speeds. These advances are particularly important for pulse sequences used for diffusion imaging and functional MRI, both critical tools for neuroimaging research, and sequences commonly applied by MEDVAMC imaging researchers. Other advances in the Prisma include a full digital acquisition and direct radio frequency (RF) excitation to further improve image quality and advanced shimming solutions. Finally, the upgrade includes new pulse sequences that improve patient comfort through silent scanning and shorter scan times. In addition to the scanner itself, we request an accessory package for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) stimuli presentation that works in conjunction with the scanner. It would replace an existing Invivo Eloquence system that was acquired with our current Siemens Trio scanner and which is currently out of warranty and obsolete. The MEDVAMC team has a long-standing infrastructure to support the administration and maintenance of the requested equipment, including existing expertise in MR physics, radiology, and imaging analysis, as well as well-integrated access to Siemens scientists and research MRI technologists. Leadership responsibilities and the administrative structure forged during the MEDVAMC's Center of Excellence in TBI and extended as part of MEDVAMC's prominent role in the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) have led to successful maintenance and utilization of the research scanner for the last 8 years. The group of major users have been productive in imaging research specifically targeting Veteran populations, and the proposed scanner upgrade would further support and promote these research efforts. The Prisma scanner upgrade and the integrated SensaVue package would also facilitate development, testing and utilization of additional cutting-edge sequences designed by our group and others, such as the simultaneous multislice diffusion and fMRI sequences and correlated spectroscopy we are collaborating with others to optimize. Finally, the upgrade would promote wider interface and collaboration with other VA, academic and government institutions that are utilizing these newer scanners, such as is the case in the development of a normative imaging library. Utilization of this state-of-the-art platform at the MEDVAMC would facilitate creating and testing future standards in imaging acquisition and quality assurance and calibration that are rapidly developing, and support projects related to novel phantom development and standardized quality assurance as well as sequence development. The installation of this upgraded system would uniquely facilitate Veteran participation in additional innovative MRI research consortium and Merit Review projects in traumatic brain injury (TBI), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorders (SUD), and other medical and psychiatric conditions to enhance diagnosis, evaluate and monitor long-term change associated with these conditions, and evaluate potential treatment alternatives."
"9618399","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        COPD is a disease with high morbidity and mortality. Environmental exposures are often responsible for disease development and worsening of existing disease. Recent evidence shows that exposure to indoor air pollution (particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) increases COPD severity, but the mechanisms for this worsening remain unknown. Furthermore, preliminary studies suggest that a subgroup of individuals with chronic bronchitis demonstrate worse symptoms and outcomes following exposure to indoor pollutants, suggesting that the alterations in mucus production and clearance common to chronic bronchitics may play a role in this observation. However, the specifics of the why this group may be more susceptible to the health effects of indoor pollution exposure remain to be fully understood.         In this application, the investigators plan to investigate the role of mucociliary clearance (MCC) and mucus properties in predicting response to indoor air pollution exposure in individuals with COPD. They also aim to determine whether MCC and mucus properties change over time following PM and NO2 exposure in a subgroup of individuals with chronic bronchitis. To complete their aims the investigators will leverage resources from an ongoing Baltimore-based cohort study of former smokers with COPD that aims to determine whether home interventions designed to reduce PM and NO2 exposure improve health outcomes. In this current application, to determine whether baseline MCC and mucus properties predict response to PM and NO2 exposure, 60 individuals with COPD will undergo baseline assessment of MCC using gamma camera technology and induced sputum will be analyzed for mucin concentration, DNA concentration, and mucus solids concentration; individuals will be followed longitudinally with assessment of clinical outcomes along with comprehensive indoor environmental assessment at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months of follow up. In a group of 20 individuals with chronic bronchitis, we will assess MCC and mucus properties along with indoor environmental monitoring at baseline, 3 months and 6 months of follow up to determine whether changes in NO2 and PM concentration alter these mucus outcomes. Ultimately, the information gained from this application will contribute to understanding the mechanism behind the adverse health effects observed in COPD in relation to pollution exposures, and to determine whether these exposures can alter critical components of host defense. Additionally, these data will have implications for the management of COPD and utilization of environmental modification strategies for at-risk individuals.         The candidate, a physician completing her training in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, has demonstrated a dedication to developing a career in clinical research that is tied closely to her strong background in environmental health. Though she is early in her career, she has shown a great deal of initiative, motivation, and productivity in her ongoing research endeavors. This application is structured to allow the candidate to achieve her long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator exploring the role of environmental exposures in determining COPD outcomes and the mechanisms by which such exposures impact disease. In the immediate timeframe, this application would allow the candidate dedicated time to conduct the outlined research project, as well as pursue didactic training in design and conduct of clinica trials and further quantitative methods relevant to this project and future research plans. Additionally, the data generated from this research proposal will form the basis for an R01 application. The Career Development Plan for this candidate includes a structured approach to mentoring, didactic coursework focused on a specific research goal, participation in local and national meetings and identification and regular assessment of career milestones.         The research environment provided by Johns Hopkins University as well as the mentorship team described in this application will assist in Dr. Paulin's successful completion of her career and research goals. The Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Johns Hopkins University have a long history of training successful young clinical researchers in a supportive and collaborative environment. The pre-existing structure of the parent study for this application, set within the strong foundation of the Center for Childhood Asthma in the Urban Environment, as well as the applicant's established and ongoing collaboration with her team of mentors, will ensure that the study goals will be completed within the timeframe of this award. We have assembled a mentoring team of established faculty with many years of productive research experience and substantial prior mentoring experience.

"9421434","Project Summary In chronic heart failure patients, thromboembolic events are the most common complication, resulting in increased hospitalization rates and mortality. Prevention of cardiac thrombosis in heart failure (HF) patients with anticoagulant therapy is controversial because of the increased risk of bleeding. Cardiac endothelial cells normally promote anticoagulation through multiple pathways including activated protein C (APC) generation on their luminal surface. In HF, the endothelial surface becomes increasingly prothrombotic partly due to altered endothelial anticoagulation. Alterations in APC and thrombin generation, and increased von Willebrand factor (vWF) extrusion from the endothelium, are likely consequences of a prothrombotic endothelium. A recombinant form of APC has been used in clinical trials but is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. An alternative therapeutic approach may involve promotion of multiple endogenous endothelial anticoagulant pathways. Cardiac sympathetic nerves make close appositions with endocardial endothelial cells (EECs) that line the cardiac chambers; these direct connections are unlike those with vascular endothelium where smooth muscle separates nerve from endothelial cell. Sympathetic nerves regulate many aspects of normal endothelial function likely through release of norepinephrine (NE) and neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and galanin. We suspect that neuropeptides promote the anticoagulant function of endothelial cells. We hypothesize that neuropeptide release is suppressed in HF promoting endothelial dysfunction and a reduction in anticoagulation function. We test this hypothesis with human HF and control ventricular tissue and plasma, and in a mouse model of HF. We will determine: (i) the spatial and functional link between endocardial thrombosis and aberrant ventricular innervation; examined in HF mice with a novel combined contrast-enhanced ultrasound and microPET approach; (ii) the mechanisms, both direct and indirect, through which neuropeptides promote endothelial anticoagulation; examined in cultured human heart failure EECs; (iii) the promotion of endothelial anticoagulant function by neuropeptide treatment in vivo in HF mice; (iv) whether plasma neuropeptide levels in HF subjects can be used as early biomarkers of a prothrombotic state. Significance: A critical link between subendocardial nerve activity and endothelial anticoagulant function will be identified in these studies. Preliminary data suggest that neuropeptides promote endothelial anticoagulant function, and this function is disrupted in HF. If this is the case, neuropeptide treatment may provide a novel therapy for reducing thromboembolic complications in HF patients. Establishing a relationship between circulating neuropeptide levels and thrombus formation will identify novel early biomarkers of thromboembolic risk in HF patients."
"9658106","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  R01:Biomimetic Surface for Neural Implant PI:  Tracy Cui Implantable microelectrode arrays for neural recording and stimulation have demonstrated tremendous research and clinical potential.  Studies of brain tissue response to neural electrode arrays have revealed localized microglia activation, followed by astrocytic scarring and neural degeneration.  These reactions are thought to contribute to the low yield and chronic failure of neural recording, although direct links have not been soundly established.  Past studies characterizing the CNS response to implants have used postmortem histology at discrete time points.  This approach suffers from a large degree of variability and fails to capture the dynamic molecular, cellular and vascular changes of the host.  To address this issue, we have developed an experimental set-up to directly image the electrode-tissue interface in live animals using 2-photon microscopy in conjunction with electrical recording.  Our previous work indicates that by coating the surface of neural probes with neural adhesion molecules, neuronal density around the device can be promoted while glial reaction attenuated.  Meanwhile, neural recording quality is drastically improved.  We hypothesize that promoting neuronal growth and health, and/or inhibiting microglia activation will lead to recording improvement.  The specific objectives of thi project are to investigate the biological mechanisms of the coating's effect on recording and to evaluate the clinical potential of biomimetic coating in a brain machine interface (BMI) model.  First, the acute neuronal and microglia responses to coated probes will be characterized in transgenic animals using two photon imaging and electrical recording for two weeks.  Real time tissue characteristics (such as neuronal and neurite density, microglia density and morphology, vasculature change and BBB leakage) will be correlated to recording metrics(such as unit yield, SNR, amplitude of signal and noise as well as impedance).  Several biomolecules that promote or inhibit neuronal growth or microglia activation will be immobilized on the Blackrock arrays to test our hypothesis.  Secondly, the long-term benefit of the coatings on recording will be determine by testing the optimum coating conditions in rats for 6 months.  Explants will be taken monthly to examine the coating longevity, while immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis of the tissue at the interface will be performed to characterize the cellular and molecular change over time.  Thirdly, to assess the potential of biomimetic coating for clinical application, coated electrodes will be tested in rhesus monkeys in a brain-machine-interface (BMI) model.  Recording metrics such as SNR, signal amplitude, unit yield and stability will be quantified over 2 years and compared to uncoated arrays.  A novel functional metric will be developed to assess functionality of the recorded signals.  BMI performance will be evaluated based on speed and accuracy.  This proposal combines the cutting edge real-time imaging, effective biomaterial strategies and state of the art brain machine interface technology to understand the interactions between neural implants and host tissue.  The findings will guide the development of seamless neural interface devices for BMI, visual and auditory prosthesis, deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, depression and epilepsy, to name a few.  The knowledge will also benefit other brain implants from biochemical sensing and therapeutic delivery to scaffold and stem cell transplant for treating neurological disorders."
"9599999","ABSTRACT Overdose acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AILI) accounts for nearly 50% of the acute liver failure cases each year. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the only antidote used clinically to ameliorate AILI; however, the effectiveness of NAC declines rapidly after APAP ingestion. Developing new life-saving treatment is critically needed. APAP-induced hepatocyte stress/damage results in the activation of liver resident M?s (Kupffer cells, KCs) and the recruitment of infiltrating M?s (IMs). We and others have demonstrated a hepato-protective function of hepatic M?s. A major goal of our research is to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. APAP challenge causes profound liver tissue hypoxia, which triggers the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1? and HIF2?. Our preliminary studies using mice with myeloid-specific deletion of HIF2? (HIF2?mye/-) revealed a critical hepato-protective function of hepatic M?-derived HIF2?. Screening of the hepatic protective and pro-toxicant factors shows that IL-6 mRNA level is significantly lower in the liver and nonparenchymal cells of HIF2?mye/- mice compared with WT mice. It is recently reported that HIF2? directly regulates IL-6 transcription. Together, these findings led to our hypothesis that APAP treatment leads to HIF2? stabilization in hepatic M?s, and that HIF2?, via promoting IL-6 production, plays a critical role in M?-mediated hepato-protection. We propose three Specific Aims to examine this hypothesis: (Aim 1). Determine the hepato-protective effect of the myeloid-specific HIF2?/IL-6 axis in AILI. (Aim 2). Evaluate the therapeutic potential of HIF stabilization in attenuating AILI. (Aim 3). Define the molecular mechanisms of the hepato-protective effects of myeloid-specific HIF2?/IL-6 axis. The findings will provide important insight into endogenous protective mechanisms during AILI. The knowledge gained could uncover therapeutic target and advance the development of antidote to treat patients with AILI."
"9574316","Abstract/Summary Transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic and epigenetic studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of cell and organ biology. However, the vast majority of these studies have been conducted in bulk tissues derived from humans or animals with each tissue type comprised of multiple different cells, each with its own unique transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic and epigenetic profile. The huge body of knowledge gained from these studies has suffered, nevertheless, from a lack of cell-type-specific fidelity making it nearly impossible to attribute biological features and signatures to their cell-type of origin. In addition, significant differences in transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic and epigenetic profiles of different cell types have been missed because they have been overshadowed by profiles in other cell types, and, perhaps more significantly, heterogeneous high and low expression profiles of significance to function and disease are obscured by buffering to their mean when different cells of different types are homogenized together. These limitations reduce the scope of discoveries, including those of high significance to our Veterans, since significant disease-specific changes in transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic and epigenetic profiles may not be appreciable in bulk tissue homogenates that average expression levels across cell types. To mitigate these limitations the established, funded JJ Peters VA scientists participating in this ShEEP request (10 Major Users and 3 Minor Users) have begun to shift aspects of their research to cell-type-specific studies using high throughput fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). These efforts have been limited and significantly hampered by the lack of local access to a sophisticated high-throughput multi-cell type sorting capable FACS instrument. Hindrances have included having to transport fragile and precious samples across 7.5 miles to the affiliate core facilities; competition for instrument time with hundreds of affiliate core facility users and inability to FACS process fresh specimens from Veteran donors. To overcome these limitations and hindrances we propose to use ShEEP and already secured in-kind resources to purchase and operate a state-of-the-art FACS instrument of sufficient sophistication to permit its use locally at the JJ Peters VAMC in the context of the funded Veteran-centric studies of high priority diseases and conditions to the VA, such as suicide, TBI, SCI, PTSD, Alzheimer?s disease, serious mental illness and cancer."
"9664070","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a common skin inflammatory condition with rapidly rising prevalence among industrial nations in recent decades. Acute ACD is characterized by an intense skin rash and itching that develops at the site of exposure to contact allergens like nickel in about 20% of general population. Acute ACD is known to have tumor-suppressing effects in the skin, which has led to its use for the treatment of warts and skin cancers. However, the effects of chronic ACD on skin cancer have not been fully investigated. Implantable medical devices such as orthopedic, dental, and cardiac implants are a source of chronic ACD. These devices are being increasingly used in medical practice, which highlights the importance of research on chronic ACD to better treat this condition and prevent its associated adverse events. In a recent report, we found that chronic ACD to an orthopedic metal implant led to an invasive skin cancer in a patient. To demonstrate a causal relationship, we used the standard mouse model of contact hypersensitivity and showed that chronic application of a contact allergen to carcinogen-treated skin led to the development of aggressive skin cancers in the animals. The chronic ACD-associated inflammation was required for the skin cancer development. Importantly, we found a similar tumor-promoting inflammatory environment surrounding the skin cancer in our patient. These findings highlight a fundamental question: how does an anti-tumor immune response turn into a pro-tumor immune environment in its chronic phase? In order to address this question and determine the mechanism of tumor promotion by chronic ACD, I hypothesized that (a) skin-derived factors mediate the transition from anti-tumor skin inflammation in acute ACD to pro-tumor skin inflammation in chronic ACD, and (b) the tumor-promoting immune environment in chronic ACD is mediated by the interactions between several groups of immune cell types. To test these hypotheses, I propose to (1) determine the mechanism that mediates the transition from tumor-suppressing immune response in acute ACD to tumor- promoting immune environment in chronic ACD, and (2) Determine the mechanism of tumor promotion in chronic ACD. The outcome of this research will provide a mechanistic insight into the role of ACD in skin cancer development. Considering the role of chronic inflammation in promoting cancer development in several organs, the understanding of how chronic ACD promotes skin cancer will be highly applicable in blocking the tumor-promoting effects of chronic inflammation in the skin and other organs."
"9467571","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The developmental mechanisms that lead to under-connectivity, over-connectivity, and mis-connectivity between association regions of the cerebral cortex in autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and other diseases of cortical circuit development (DCCDs) remain undefined. Our published work from the last phase of this project, plus additional preliminary data, indicates that distinct cortical developmental mechanisms are disrupted in mouse genetic models of DiGeorge/22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS), a genetic syndrome with one of the strongest associations with ASD, ADHD and SCZ vulnerability. We will now test the hypothesis that selective, reversible developmental disruption of connections made by layer 2/3 cortical projection neurons between and within association cortices underlies behavioral changes in mouse models of 22q11 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS). We will define for the first time the relationship between selectively altered development in association cortices and pathologic changes in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, connectivity and behavior in genetic models of ASD, ADHD, and SCZ vulnerability. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether altered basal progenitor proliferation selectively diminishes of layer 2/3 cortical projection neuron (cPN) frequency in association regions in 22q11DS mouse models. We will evaluate changes in axon growth and guidance from the diminished population of layer 2/3 cPNs for quantitative and qualitative changes in association cortical connectivity. Our data will establish whether reduced layer 2/3 cPN neurogenesis and related disruption of axon growth account for 22q11DS behavioral pathology due to under-connectivity. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether metabolically-mediated changes in layer 2/3 cPN dendritic differentiation disrupt development of local synaptic contacts between layer 2/3 cPNs and key inhibitory or modulatory inputs in association cortical areas. We will assess the contribution of these changes, apparently influenced by distinct 22q11 candidate genes, independent of diminished layer 2/3 cPN genesis to key behavioral impairments in 22q11DS mouse models. In Specific Aim 3, we will assess the feasibility of reversing these developmental changes via pharmacological manipulation of antioxidant defense/reactive oxygen species clearance during development versus adulthood. Our current observations suggest that 22q11 deletion results in oxidative stress and diminished growth in cortical neurons, and that the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine can reverse these effects. Our work will provide a mechanistic foundation for current efforts to use antioxidants as a therapeutic agent for patients with a wide range of DCCDs. Together our results will define the selective contribution of developmental mechanisms that lead to association cortical over/under connectivity versus misconnectivity in ASD, ADHD or SCZ, and the relatively effectiveness of correcting specific developmental deficits for improving behavioral outcomes in DCCDs."
"9497951","Neuroinflammation has been recognized as an essential player in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially for the late-onset AD. This notion is supported by the facts that glial activation and elevated cytokines have been observed in AD animal models and patients. Furthermore, genome-wide associated studies have identified inflammatory genes in the innate immune system, such as CLU, CR1 and TREM2, as AD risk factors. Recently, the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein platform that tightly regulates the innate immune response, has been suggested to play critical roles in AD development. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for the production of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-18, ultimately leading to inflammatory responses. Given the important role of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1? in AD, development of selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors (NLRP3Is) as chemical probes with well- defined mode of action will not only enhance our current knowledge on the NLRP3 inflammasome in AD pathogenesis, but also provide translational promise to this disease. Recently, we developed a lead inhibitor that blocks the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in inhibition of IL-1? production both in vitro and in vivo. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in chronic inflammatory responses of AD, and pharmacological suppression with small molecule inhibitors that directly target the NLRP3 inflammasome platform will prevent or inhibit AD disease progression. In support of this hypothesis, our preliminary studies showed that the lead inhibitor engaged the NLRP3 inflammasome, reduced AD pathology, and improved cognitive functions in transgenic AD mouse models, thus providing proof-of-concept for developing NLRP3Is as in vivo probes. Furthermore, our preliminary structure activity relationship (SAR) studies confirmed that this chemical scaffold can be optimized to improve inhibitory potency and pharmacokinetic properties. The goal of this proposal is to understand the chemical space of this scaffold and to develop more potent analogs by comprehensive SAR studies as in vivo probes and three specific aims are proposed to achieve our objective in this application. In Aim 1, new analogs of this lead structure will be designed and synthesized to provide understanding of SAR for this scaffold that will guide the development of more potent inhibitors. In Aim 2, the designed new analogs will be evaluated in tiered biological systems for potency, selectivity, target engagement, and immunotoxicity. In aim 3, the top candidate inhibitor identified from Aim 2 will be tested to confirm the in vivo efficacy in a transgenic AD mouse model. The proposed research is highly significant because successful development of novel and selective NLRP3Is will not only provide effective pharmacological tools to precisely define the contribution of the NLRP3 inflammasome in disease pathogenesis, but also provide promising candidates for clinical studies, thus offering translational potential to achieve clinical benefits."
"9428568","Project Summary/Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects 2 to 5 percent of the U.S. population. Children with FASD have high rates of mental health problems that place a significant burden on their families, local resources, and society. Problems with emotion regulation are implicated in most mental health disorders. Few empirically-validated interventions exist for children with FASD. Research suggests that child-focused interventions targeting emotion regulation in children with FASD are insufficient to habilitate their emotion regulation skills to adaptive levels. The proposed study investigates a novel intervention target to improve the emotion regulation and adaptive functioning of children with FASD. Research with other populations provides ample evidence for the influence of parent emotion socialization on the development of child emotion regulation and other outcomes. Parent emotion socialization is amenable to intervention and results in improved child and parent outcomes in other populations. The overarching goal of the proposed study is to test whether an existing emotion-focused parenting intervention improves parent emotion socialization and child emotion regulation and behavior in children with FASD. In addition, this study will investigate the parent emotion socialization attitudes and practices that are associated with more adaptive emotion regulation in children with FASD. Study aims will be addressed in the context of a randomized controlled trial with a delayed-waitlist control group. A total of 80 children (ages 4 to 12) with FASD and their parents will be enrolled, and multi-level assessments (parent-report, observation, physiology) will be conducted at three time points (baseline, immediate post-intervention, 3-month follow-up). Study hypotheses are: 1) that specific parent and child characteristics will predict individual differences in the emotion socialization attitudes and practices of parents raising children with FASD; 2) that specific parent emotion socialization attitudes and practices are associated with more adaptive levels of emotion regulation in children with FASD; 3) that families who receive the Tuning In To Kids intervention will demonstrate improved parent emotion socialization, child emotion regulation, and child behavior in comparison to families in the waitlist control group; and 4) that parent emotion socialization will mediate the intervention effect on child emotion regulation and behavior. Results of this study will have a significant impact on the future development of parent training interventions with long- range outcomes of improving child functioning and reducing the burden associated with mental health problems in this population. The proposed study will also lay the foundation and guide more complex developmental study of the parent and child factors that influence the development of emotion regulation in children with FASD."
"9486910","7. PROECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  The packaging, transport, recognition, and fusion of vesicle-enclosed cargo is an essential hallmark of eukaryotes, and must be tightly regulated for basic cellular organization. A key step in vesicular trafficking is a tethering event where vesicles are attached to their pre-determined target membrane prior to SNARE mediated fusion by tethering complexes. Multi-subunit tethering complexes (MTCs) are one such categorization of conserved tethering proteins, and are required for a majority a membrane trafficking steps within the cell. However, despite their name, there is a dearth of biochemical evidence showing the capacity of these MTCs to recruit and hold vesicles to a target membrane prior to fusion. Thus, I propose a series of experiments to reconstitute vesicle tethering in vitro using post-Golgi secretory vesicles and the MTC exocyst to definitively observe the proposed tethering activity of the complex and to gain structural and mechanistic insights into tethering events. To accurately and sensitively observe vesicle tethering, we seek to employ a single molecule assay TIRF microscopy based assay to observed individual tethering events and changes to exocyst conformations in real-time. Furthermore, we seek to gain structural insights into the overall architecture of the exocyst complex and the binding sites for various proteins that are thought to participate in the tethering event using negative stain electron microscopy techniques. The information gained from these experiments will not only determine the proposed tethering activity of exocyst and serve as a platform for other MTCs to be tested, but reveal mechanism details of the poorly understood, but essential tethering set in membrane trafficking."
"9412949","Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Recent studies have shown that ion channels can regulate many malignant features of tumor cells. TRPM7, a subfamily member of the transient receptor potential (TRP), has a very high permeability for both Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). In addition to its channel activity, it contains a functional ?-kinase domain within its C terminus. Using A172 and U87 MG, two human glioma cell lines, we found strong evidence supporting the expression of functional Ca(2+) sensing ion channel in these cells. Moreover, electrophysiological and pharmacological data strongly indicated the involvement of TRPM7 channels in mediating the Ca (2+)-sensing current in glioma cells. Suppression of TRPM7 channels inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion of malignant human gliomas, indicating that TRPM7 channels may represent a novel and promising target for therapeutic intervention of malignant glioma. In addition, we found that TRPM7 channels regulate glioma stem cell (GSC) growth/proliferation through STAT3 and Notch signaling pathways. These observations led us to test the OVERALL HYPOTHESIS that TRPM7 activity may mediate GBM progression through JAK2/STAT3 and Notch1 pathways and that TRPM7 may be a novel GBM drug target. However, the genetic profiles tend to change dramatically when existing human glioma cell lines are placed in serum-based culture for extended time whereas glioma patient-derived xenolines (PDX) generated by new techniques preserve relatively constant genetic profiles over long periods. Therefore, we will test our hypothesis using a suitable range of disaggregated xenograft lines and validate with human GBM cells. The significance of this study is that its completion will greatly enhance our understanding of the development and progression of glioma, which may lead to novel and useful biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets in the context of GBM. The two specific aims are: [1] Determine the role for TRPM7 in regulation of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) homeostasis in GBM patient-derived xenolines (PDX) and PDX-derived cancer stem cells (GSC). [2] Determine JAK2/STAT3 and Notch signaling pathways regulated by TRPM7 in the development and progression of glioma and maintenance of self-renewal capability and tumorigenicity of GSC using PDX and PDX-derived GSC. "
"9500063","Diffuse gliomas are a leading cause of cancer-related death in people under 45 years old, with malignant brain tumors resulting in the greatest number of years of potential life lost in US adults. Modern large-scale genetic discovery has identified somatic molecular genomic alterations that can better classify these tumors. Recurrent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutations are found in up to 20% of adult diffuse gliomas, identifying tumors with distinct etiology, associated genetic alterations, and overall natural history. As a result, IDH mutant gliomas have been newly-recognized as separate diagnostic entities within the 2016 World Health Organization Histological Classification. These gliomas are typically diagnosed in younger adults ranging from 20-50 years old, initially presenting as lower-grade lesions that can be responsive to standard-of-care treatments such as surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy. However, these cancers inexorably progress to become higher-grade lesions, and prove fatal in most cases. New treatments are needed.  In our prior work, we have shown that the altered metabolism within IDH1 mutant cells exposes the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthetic enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) to selective inhibition with small molecules, resulting in profound genotype-specific metabolic vulnerabilities in IDH1 mutant cancer cells. Highlighting the central importance of NAD+ levels in IDH mutant gliomas, these observations strongly suggest that alternative strategies targeting NAD+ homeostasis may achieve substantial efficacy against these tumors. Herein, we propose to evaluate modulation of NAD+ steady-state levels in IDH mutant gliomas by multiple non-overlapping approaches, to identify unique dependencies, mediators of sensitivity and potential combinatorial therapeutic strategies. In addition, we plan to test innovative delivery methods which could minimize the toxicities associated with NAMPTi monotherapy, widening the therapeutic window for clinical translation.  The successful completion of our proposed research will open new avenues for targeting the unique metabolic vulnerabilities of IDH1 mutant gliomas, translating into potential clinical therapies for patients with these tumors."
"9431556","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This submission outlines a five-year mentored training plan for the career development of a physician-scientist to characterize the regulatory role of the short non-coding RNA, microRNA-146a, in B cell activation and function, and examine this in human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. MicroRNA-146a has been characterized as a negative regulator of the NF?B and interferon signaling pathways in myeloid and/or T cells, but its function in B cells is not well defined. Because microRNAs often target different pathways in immune cells, this proposal serves to fill this gap in knowledge in B cells to better understand its dysregulation in human SLE disease. A combination of cellular immunology, molecular biology, and RNA sequencing/bioinformatics analysis will be used to rigorously characterize microRNA-146a's role in activated B cells. In addition, both a hypothesis based and discovery based approach will seek to identify novel gene targets. Furthermore, this proposal will examine microRNA-146a's B cell expression in relationship to human SLE activity and flare, thus probing its translational use as a novel disease biomarker. This project is consistent with NIAMS goals of advancing research in human SLE, which has been challenging in part due to difficulties in assessing ongoing disease activity, which this proposal attempts to address. The applicant is currently in her 4th year as a PhD Candidate via the UCLA STAR physician-scientist program under the mentorship of her current thesis advisor, Dr. Dinesh Rao, an expert in non-coding RNA biology. The proposed 5-year K08 training period will be under the scientific mentorship of Dr. Rao and Dr. Alexander Hoffmann, a long time collaborator, whose expertise is in quantitative experimentation and bioinformatics analysis in inflammatory gene signaling pathways. In addition, the applicant will receive clinical/translational research mentorship from Dr. Maureen McMahon, Director of UCLA's Lupus Clinical Trials Center, who has long-standing experience with SLE clinical trial methodology and biomarker discovery. The new molecular techniques, bioinformatics analysis, and translational skills will be broadly applicable to microRNAs in autoimmune diseases. This training proposal will provide the necessary mentorship and support for the applicant to develop into a successful independent investigator."
