"9456783","Abstract The Summer Undergraduate Research in Physiology (SURP) program at the University of Michigan (UM), currently funded by the R25HL108842 (?Promoting Diversity of Future Scientists?), is proposed to be extended to another five incoming classes to provide training for underrepresented students to enter advanced graduate programs or pursue careers in biomedical and clinical research. The renewal SURP program includes 25 excellent faculty mentors from 5 basic science and 7 clinical departments within the UM Medical School, who have collectively mentored 114 summer undergraduate trainees, 51 of whom from underrepresented backgrounds. During the past four years, we evaluated 153 applications and enrolled 36 students from across the US. Notably, 91% (21/23) of our SURP trainees who have finished their undergraduate degrees are pursuing advanced graduate degrees, or holding technical positions in academic biomedical research settings or in private sectors. Five of the 36 students have published at least one paper with their research mentors, and at least eight more manuscripts are in progress. The focus of this renewal application is to continue the successful SURP program by recruiting 10 students per summer. Our 12-week summer research program includes (1) fulltime hands-on research experience in laboratories of our faculty mentors, (2) mentoring meetings to ensure that student trainees are taking maximum advantages of all the resources available to them; and (3) end of summer mini-symposium with oral presentations given by the students sharing their research projects. The SURP educational program incorporates a noon lecture series, designed specifically for the summer trainees and presented by faculty members, that teaches important physiology and research- related principles, including the use of different model organisms, ethics in laboratory research, and career opportunities in biomedical sciences. The SURP research education program will continue to be under the oversight of an Internal Advisory Committee, and student selection and progress monitoring accomplished by a Student Selection and Mentoring Committee. As such, we are fully committed to providing training to talented college students, from currently underrepresented backgrounds, to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse population."
"9604717","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objectives of this renewal application continue to focus on investigating the molecular physiology of the intestinal absorption process of the water- soluble vitamin biotin, the transport system involved, i.e., the Sodium-dependent Multi- Vitamin Transporter (SMVT), and how the absorption process is affected by external/environmental factors and pathophysiological conditions.  Biotin is indispensable for normal cellular metabolism, proliferation and survival. The vitamin acts as a co-factor for multiple carboxylases that play critical roles in fatty acid, glucose and amino acid metabolism. Emerging evidence also highlight an important roles for biotin in immune function and in gene expression.  Humans and other mammals cannot synthesize biotin, and thus, must obtain the vitamin from exogenous sources via intestinal absorption. Intestinal absorption of biotin occurs via a Na+-dependent and regulated carrier-mediated process. In studies performed during the current funding period, we have generated a conditional (intestine-specific) SMVT- knockout (KO) mouse model to establish the relative contribution of SMVT toward intestinal carrier-mediated biotin absorption and obtained evidence that this system is the only biotin uptake system that operates in the gut. Unexpectedly, however, we came across a very interesting phenomenon in that all the SMVT KO mice developed spontaneous chronic intestinal inflammation, especially in the cecum. In other studies, we found that chronic alcohol exposure significantly inhibit intestinal biotin uptake and that the inhibition is mediated at the level of transcription of the SLC5A6 gene (the gene that encodes SMVT); our new preliminary findings suggest that the latter is, at least in part, mediated via epigenetic mechanism(s). In other new preliminary studies, we found that infecting mice with S. Typhimurium, and exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines or to bacterial LPS to lead to a significant inhibition in intestinal biotin uptake.  Based on our recently published observations and our new preliminary findings, our working hypotheses in this proposal are that the SMVT system is important for the maintenance of normal intestinal immunity and integrity, and that Salmonella infection, as well as exposure of the gut to pro-inflammatory cytokines or to bacterial LPS lead to a significant inhibition in intestinal biotin uptake. We also hypothesize that the inhibition in SLC5A6 transcription by chronic alcohol exposure is mediated, at least in part, via epigenetic mechanism(s). Three specific aims are proposed to test these hypotheses and will utilize state-of-the-art in vitro and n vivo physiological, cellular and molecular approaches.  Results of these investigations should provide novel and valuable information regarding the role of SMVT in the maintenance of normal intestinal homeostasis and health, and on how infection with enteric pathogens (Salmonella), as well as exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines (as in IBD), and to bacterial LPS (as in infection with gram negative bacteria) affect the absorption of the indispensable micronutrient biotin. The results should also shed further light onto how chronic exposure to alcohol (the most common and costly drug abuse, and a significant contributor to many disease categories) affect the normal physiology of intestinal biotin absorption."
"9605921","Abstract In vitro and in vivo models of neurodegenerative disease such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) have provided glimpses into the biological processes that go awry in these disorders. Current thinking indicates that major pathophysiologic processes include protein misfolding and accumulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, dysfunctional intracellular trafficking, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and abnormal RNA processing. The ARF family of GTP'ases are a phylogenetically- conserved family of proteins involved with membrane traffic, lipid metabolism/signaling, actin remodeling, and lipid droplet formation. Based on the apparent overlap between ALS pathophysiology and some of the biological actions of ARFs, we wondered if ARF signaling modified models of ALS. In recently published work we find that blocking activity of cytohesins (?Cy's?, ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors) is neuroprotective. Understanding the cell biological mechanism of this observation is problematic because of the pleiotropic actions of Cy's and ARFs. The path forward will be facilitated by determining the specific Cy and specific ARF involved in this process as this will guide us to the relevant cell biological process. To this end, in specific aim #1, experiments will be undertaken to determine if inhibition of an individual Cy confers protection against the toxic actions on motor neurons of mutant SOD or mutant TDP43. In specific aim #2, experiments will be undertaken to determine if inhibition of an individual ARF confers protection against the toxic actions on motor neurons of mutant SOD or mutant TDP43. Identification of the specific Cy/ARF pair that upon disabling is neuroprotective will be the launching pad for insight into mechanisms and potential therapeutic targeting."
"9615600","Project(Summary/Abstract(( Despite significant advances in the early detection of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), racial and ethnic disparities persist in rates and age of detection among children from low socioeconomic status (1). With support from NIMH (R01MH104400), our team developed and is now evaluating the effectiveness of a multi-stage screening protocol to address these health disparities among at-risk toddlers in an underserved region of Greater Boston Massachusetts (MA) referred to as the ?Circle of Promise,? where 98% of children come from racial/ethnic minority populations and 47% are English language learners. Our intervention approach involves partnering with early intervention (EI) agencies to provide targeted multi-stage screening to at-risk toddlers enrolled in Part C EI, the publicly-funded programs to which pediatricians typically refer children experiencing delays in language and other areas of development. In this project, we leverage the experiences of parents, providers and pediatricians in this multi-stage screening protocol to assess potential risks and benefits associated with ASD screening, detection, and treatment, as well as investigate challenges to retention over time among underserved communities. Expanding upon data collected from 21 parents engaged in the ASD multi-stage screening protocol, 22 EI service providers, and over 40 hours of observational data, we first propose to conduct an additional semi-structured interviews with 30 parents who were more likely to experience harms and risks associated with ASD screening (e.g., ?false positives,? loss-to-follow-up), EI service providers with extensive experience implementing the protocol (n=30), and pediatricians whose patients were diagnosed with ASD through this protocol (n=20). Employing a modified grounded theory approach, we will analyze these data and develop a conceptual framework of the risks and benefits associated with ASD screening, detection, and treatment. Given the diverse sample of parents engaged in this process, our findings will be especially germane to building new theoretic understanding of risks and benefits associated with growing disparities in early detection and treatment. Based on findings, we will then conduct a systematic evidence review to identify measures that operationalize identified risks and benefits and disseminate findings through a web-based measures clearinghouse. The clearinghouse will be made available to the research community, including the ASD Pediatrics Network, and include user surveys to facilitate a process of continuous quality improvement. !"
"9418513","This is a proposal to create a biologically active prosthetic arterial graft (PG) incorporating gene silencing and gene overexpression in an antithrombotic and pro-angiogenic surface. The research team is unique in its cohesiveness and breadth of expertise including nanotechnology, polymers, gene therapy, vascular biology, and surgery, all with an established focus on vascular grafts. This project builds on our long-standing work where we have 1) characterized the lesion of anastomotic neointimal hyperplasia (AIH) downstream of the prosthetic graft, 2) established the role of blood flow-surface interaction in AIH pathogenesis, 3) determined the unique gene signature associated with AIH development, including identification of high profile pathogenic and protective targets, 4) documented delivery of siRNA from a prosthetic surface to knockdown pathogenic genes in vascular smooth muscle cells, 5 ) documented adeno associated virus (AAV) mediated delivery of atheroprotective genes to the vascular wall and through the prosthetic surface to endothelial cells and, 6) demonstrated the advantages of a cryogel coating as a delivery system for antithrombotic and pro-angiogenic molecules and gene therapy. Based on this knowledge and achievements, we propose an optimized approach to create a highly functional and adaptable flow surface. We will build a composite PG comprising three components: A) A `backbone' graft composed of standard polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), B) An anti-thrombotic (heparin) gel with improved cell attachment properties (RGD) to be applied to the graft prior to cryogelation, and C) Biologic therapeutic agents to be incorporated in the cryogel-PG prior to surgery, which would create a high capacity multifunctional bioactive flow surface. Using gene therapy technologies, biologics with anti-inflammatory and atheroprotective properties that have been fully validated by our group will be incorporated to synthesize the composite PG. Our goal is to optimize the composite PG for delivery of drugs and biologics from the flow surface into the PG microenvironment. This would target the circulating cells invading the pseudo intima, decreasing contact activation and platelet aggregation. Additionally, this will modulate endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the native artery at the anastomosis site as to prevent their phenotypic switch that fuels AIH. In a rabbit model we will implant the composite PG with the bioactive gel applied intraluminally and/or extraluminally. We will then gauge efficacy of drug delivery, and determine its effect on PG molecular signature and AIH. This is a stepwise study bringing to bear the necessary and broad range of expertise on the effective application of a multifunctional bioactive prosthetic arterial graft to improve outcome. This work will also serve as proof of concept to instill bioactivity and adapt biomaterials for therapeutic purposes such as endografts, hernia repair, and wound coverage."
"9464201","Summary: Alcohol abuse is a major risk factor for diseases of the exocrine pancreas pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). One obstacle to understanding these diseases is the lack of clinically relevant mouse models. Feeding of an alcohol containing diet does not lead to spontaneous CP or PDAC in wild-type mice. However, we have observed that alcohol is sufficient to induce disease in mice with clinically relevant genetic alterations. Specifically, mice expressing in adult pancreatic acinar cells KrasG12D, which is the most prominent mutation observed in this disease, do not develop PDAC on a control diet but so when fed alcohol. Furthermore, mice expressing human PRSS1R122H, the most common genetic aberration associated with human hereditary pancreatitis, do not develop CP on a control diet but do after alcohol feeding. These new models are more clinically relevant that the currently available animal models. The goal of the proposed research is to improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the synergistic interaction of alcohol with clinically relevant genetic mutations. Although a large number of acute effects of alcohol have been suggested to be important for pancreatic disease development, in humans the diseases are only observed after prolonged abuse. Likewise, the effects of alcohol in these novel mouse models are chronic, not acute. We have formed a novel hypothesis that may explain our observations in these mouse models and the complexity of these diseases in humans. In preliminary studies, we observed increased accumulation of advanced glycation-end products in the pancreases of alcohol fed mice. AGES interact with the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), which is expressed on pancreatic acinar and stellate cells. AGEs activation of RAGE has previously been found to be important in acute pancreatitis, in the development of PDAC in a model of developmentally expressed oncogenic Kras, and in multiple models of alcohol induced fibrosis developed in other organs such as the liver, heart, and blood vessels. Specific Aim #1 will test the hypothesis that RAGE is involved in the development of PDAC in the alcohol fed mice expressing oncogenic mutant KrasG12D. We hypothesize that in the case of PDAC, alcohol induce AGEs activate RAGE and elevate the levels of Ras activity thus initiating the Ras/inflammation feed-forward loop which drives transformation. We will evaluate the effects of inhibiting RAGE activation using both pharmacological and genetic approaches. Specific Aim #2 will test the hypothesis that advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are involved in the development of CP in the alcohol fed mice expressing R122H. In the case of CP, we hypothesize that AGEs accumulation in the pancreatic tissue causes persistent inflammation and contributes to the observed damage. The results from this research will provide a foundation for further studies aimed at targeting RAGE for the prevention or treatment of these currently untreatable maladies."
"9444465","Project 3 Summary The goal of this program is to develop a vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 based on spread- deficient cytomegalovirus (CMV) vectors optimized for the induction of protective immune responses. Rhesus CMV (RhCMV)-vectored vaccines demonstrated unprecedented efficacy against highly virulent simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), resulting in stringent control and clearance of SIV over time. Preliminary data suggest that this efficacy correlates with the induction of unconventional CD8+ T cells recognizing epitopes in the context of MHC-II and non-classical MHC-E molecules. In this project we will dissect the mechanisms by which strain 68-1 RhCMV achieves these unprecedented T cell responses to improve protection against SIV, and to design human CMV (HCMV)-based vectors that recapitulate the optimally protective immunological profile identified in monkeys. We will focus on understanding the function of RhCMV proteins and microRNAs (miRs) involved in MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell response priming, a likely candidate for mediating protection against SIV (see Project 1). Preliminary work has identified a number of RhCMV genes that, if deleted from strain 68-1 RhCMV vectors, abrogate MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell priming, resulting in vectors that exclusively elicit MHC-II-restricted T cells. As described in Project 1, these ?MHC-II-only? vectors will enable our determination of the contribution of MHC-II-, and indirectly, MHC-E-restricted responses to protection. Given that these genes are required for MHC-E-restricted epitope targeting, their characterization offers an opportunity to delineate the mechanisms responsible for priming this unusual type of CD8+ T cell response. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which RhCMV gene products control MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell priming will allow us to design HCMV vectors that elicit similar responses in humans. In Specific Aim 1, we will study the Rh67 gene, which encodes a protein containing the canonical, MHC-E-binding peptide VL9 required for intracellular transport of MHC-E in RhCMV-infected cells. We will determine whether the HCMV orthologue of Rh67, UL40, performs a similar function and we will mechanistically dissect the structural domains of Rh67 that are required for function, in particular the role of the embedded VL9 peptide, its position in the Rh67 protein, and non-VL9 protein sequence in priming MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cells by both RhCMV and HCMV. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that viral miRs that alter vesicular trafficking in CMV- infected cells so as to create a viral assembly complex regulate peptide exchange of VL9-loaded MHC-E in this viral assembly compartment, thus promoting the induction of MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cells. In Specific Aim 3, we will additionally study how G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-like proteins encoded in the Rh214-220 region promote MHC-E-restricted T cell responses and whether this function is conserved in the related HCMV proteins US28 and US27. We expect that this project will contribute to the generation of an HCMV/HIV vector that closely recapitulates the protective CD8+ T cell response profile elicited by optimized RhCMV/SIV vectors."

"9627474","Periodontitis fuels the inflammation of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes (T2D), associates with poor glycemic control, and increases T2D morbidity. New strategies are critically needed to counter sources of periodontal infection and the resulting inflammation, both of which are refractory to standard treatments in people with T2D. However, mechanisms underlying the relationship between periodontitis and T2D remain poorly understood, impeding clinical progress. One unifying link between periodontitis and T2D is altered B cell function, and recent collaborative work between Drs. Barbara Nikolajczyk and Thomas Van Dyke showed that T2D-associated changes in B cells promote periodontitis. Our work further indicates that T cells cannot drive chronic periodontitis in T2D hosts in the absence of B cells, despite evidence that T cells promote periodontitis in lean hosts. Taken together, these findings support a model in which B cells support T2D-potentiated periodontitis, while T cells dominate periodontitis in leans. Both B cells and T cells are major sources of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), a key driver of osteoclastogenesis and periodontal bone loss. Obesity/T2D increases hematopoietic cell production of RANKL, most likely through increasing concentrations of a number of cytokines (TNF?, IL-1? and IL-6) known to drive RANKL production. These data, together with our demonstration that B cells are required for T2D-potentiated osteoclastogenesis and periodontitis, support our central hypothesis: T2D cytokines specifically up regulate B cell RANKL function, which uniquely potentiates periodontal complications of T2D. Definitive analyses are needed to fill the critical gaps in knowledge of how obesity-associated T2D impacts lymphocyte RANKL induction and function, and whether cellular sources of osteoclastogenic RANKL differ in T2D compared to lean hosts. We will use loss- and gain-of-function approaches in a standard mouse model of T2D, coupled with a standard model of chronic periodontitis, to study development of T2D-potentiated periodontal disease. We will complement the disease etiology work in mice with analysis of gingiva from people with T2D to query mechanistic underpinnings of chronic periodontitis. This strategy will identify drivers of both early and chronic phases of T2D-potentiated periodontitis to meet our long-term objective: to identify key factors that promote periodontitis in T2D compared to non-T2D subjects, and thereby pinpoint drug targets for future studies."
"9441866","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, much effort has been devoted to studying the role of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the key goals has been to understand the precise role of APP in AD. APP is clearly involved in the pathogenesis of AD. For instance, the first gene mutation identified as a cause for autosomal dominant form of AD is in the APP gene. Similarly, duplication for the APP gene is a risk factor for developing AD. APP is expressed both in neurons and glia, and while much work has been directed towards understanding its role or processing in neurons, the importance or the relevance of expression and the processing of APP in glia has not been examined. Thus, we know very little about the role of APP in glia in the development of AD. We have developed a robust APP-gain of function (APP-GOF) model in the Drosophila brain. We can express this specifically in glial cells or neurons. When we expressed APP in glia and compared to neuronal expression, we found differences in both the pattern of deposition of APP, processing of APP, and lethality induced by such expressions. We further found that the lethality strictly correlated with a specific processed peptide other than Abeta; the level of which increased with the co-expression of human BACE and resulted in a greater lethality compared to APP expression alone. These main results led us to formulate experiments to dissect the role of APP, its processing and toxicity when expressed in glial cells, and compare this with APP in neurons. Thus, our specific aims are: 1) Analyze the processing and the lethal effects of expression of APP in glial cells, 2) Analyze the effects of expression of processed peptides of APP in glia and neurons in the brain, and 3) Perform a conditional genetic screen for recessive modifiers of APP-GOF. We believe that these aims when completed, will contribute significantly to our understanding of the role played by APP in glia and its contribution to the development of the neuropathology and the disease. These studies will also likely identify new players in the APP-mediated pathway(s)."
"9558219","Project Summary/Abstract Background noise is an impediment to conversation for everyone, but for those with hearing loss, noise can be a terrible source of confusion, frustration, and social isolation. The problems of conversing in noise are all too familiar not only for people who have hearing aids or cochlear implants, but also for the millions of people with moderate hearing losses, many of them older than 65 years. This is especially troubling in restaurants or a retirement home's dining hall, which provide pivotal occasions for social interaction. The goal of this project is to develop a low-cost assistive listening device that will make it easy to participate in conversations in noisy environments. The focus is on a device that does its designated task well rather than a system overloaded with extraneous features that detract from its primary purpose. Current wireless assistive listening devices for such situations allow one person to receive enhanced speech signals from multiple talkers, and so do not provide assistance to more than one person in a group. Multi-way communication systems that allow communication among all participants cost more than $1000, making them too expensive for common use. In the proposed system, each person in a group wears a wireless earset with a boom microphone and earphone (similar in form to Bluetooth devices worn on one ear). Speech signals picked up by each microphone are transmitted by radio and processed in such a way that all persons in the group can hear each other as in a conference call. If two or more people speak at the same time, listeners in the group hear the voices overlap naturally. The benefit for speech reception arises from the proximity of the microphone to the talker's mouth, which increases the signal-to-ambient noise ratio by up to 20 dB over that received acoustically at a listener's ear. This figuratively corresponds to speaking directly into every group member's ear at a distance of a few centimeters. The expected ease of operation and low cost of these devices makes them ideal for general use at family gatherings and meals, retirement homes, and restaurants, not only for people with hearing loss but anyone wishing to more easily participate in conversations. Work in Phase I will focus on circuit design to maximize audio performance with minimal size, cost, and power drain, as well as ergonomic design for ease of use. Tests of speech intelligibility in noise will be performed to quantify the benefit to the user. The operational simplicity of this approach will lead to a low-cost and easy-to-use assistive listening product to improve the quality of life of millions of people, especially those with impaired hearing."
"9450525","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rates of obesity and obesity related chronic health conditions are higher in adolescents with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) than those in the general population. Many of the negative health consequences observed in obese adults are already present in obese adolescents with IDD. To explore both diets and delivery systems, we completed a 2 month self-funded trial to assess the feasibility of using a technology driven system for weight management in adolescents with IDD. Twenty-two overweight/obese (BMI > 85th percentile) adolescents with mild to moderate IDD parent were randomized to a weight loss intervention using either an enhanced Stop Light Diet (enhanced with portion controlled meals (eSLD); n=11) or a Conventional Diet (CD); n=11). All participants received support from a parent. All participants received a progressive physical activity program that targeted an increase in steps ~3,000/day above baseline. Program delivery was achieved utilizing existing technology including an iPad using the FaceTimeTM application for weekly meetings and diet and physical activity was monitored using either a standard pedometer or the FitBit pedometer and Lose it! Application synced to the iPad. Twenty adolescents (11 boys, 9 girls: mean age 14.9 ( +/- 2.2) years; BMI percentile = 93.4 (+/- 6.3) percent; 30 percent minorities) completed the study. The mean weight loss at 2 months was 4.6 (+/-0.8) percent and 3.1 (+/-0.8) percent in the eSLD and CD groups, respectively. The lack of external funding prohibited a longer trial. To estimate the magnitude of weight loss that might be expected over 6 months, the time frame for weight loss in the proposed study, we assumed the rate of weight loss for months 1-2 observed in the pilot study and reduced this by 50 percent. This results in a projected weight loss at 6 months of 6.9 percent and 4.6 percent for the eSLD and CD groups, respectively. We now propose a 3 group randomized trial to evaluate the intervention delivery system and type of reduced energy diet. We will randomize 123 overweight/obese adolescents with mild to moderate IDD to one of 3 groups for an 18 month trial (6 month weight loss; 12 month weight maintenance): group 1) Face-To-Face/CD; group 2) Technology delivery/CD; group 3) Technology delivery/eSLD. All participants will receive a progressive program of physical activity. FTF will meet with a health educator and will track progress using pen and paper records for both physical activity and diet. TECH groups will receive the intervention using an iPad with the FaceTimeTM application for video meetings with a health educator and will track progress using the Lose it! application for both physical activity and diet. We will be adequately powered to compare which diet and which delivery system provides the most promising results with weight at 6 months as the primary outcome. Secondarily, we will determine if weight loss is maintained long-term (18 months) and will have extensive process analysis to determine relationships between energy balance variables, process variables, and psychosocial variables. Lastly, we will complete a cost analysis to determine if the use of technology reduces costs compared to the traditional face-to-face delivery system."
"9658330","Abstract The establishment of an NIMHD Exploratory Center of Excellence (CoE) at Mercer University has the potential to greatly reduce health disparities among rural residents (comprising 20% of the nation's population). The proposed CoE has many unique features that would facilitate its success, including 1) building upon a heavily supported existing Center that is located within a medically underserved community; and 2) focusing on the use of emerging technologies in administrative, research, training, and outreach activities. The CoE's highly interdisciplinary focus is reflective of emerging evidence of the importance of trans-discipline research in disparities-elimination efforts. The Administrative Core's innovative technology-facilitated collaboration approach has the potential to become a new model for research capacity building. The Research Core focuses on three leading disparities in rural communities (diabetes, hypertension, and prostate cancer). Both Research Subprojects heavily involve the local community and attempt to directly address specific barriers to healthy living (transportation, access to services, etc.) in diverse rural populations. The Research Training/Education Core combines traditional training models with innovative cyber-mentoring experiences designed to increase minority and underserved student and faculty involvement in rural health disparities elimination research. The Core's activities include conducting a Disparities-Elimination Summer Research Experience (DESRE) program for undergraduate and graduate students, providing postdoctoral research experiences for emerging rural health researchers, and establishing a cyber-mentoring network to increase the access of junior faculty in rural areas to senior research mentors. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core focuses on building community capacity to address health disparities, designed to increase health literacy and build community- based participatory research infrastructure to help maintain research activities even after the funding period. The proposed activities of the Center of Excellence will collaboratively work to eliminate disparities among one of the largest health disparity populations in the United States."
"9475075","Project 3 Summary Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), one of the most prevalent of human leukemias, is a natural model of dysregulated granulopoiesis driven by the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase. Whereas tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib have dramatically improved the prognosis in CML, lifelong treatment is needed, with a corresponding large economic impact on the health care system. The two biggest unaddressed questions in the field of CML therapeutics are to understand the mechanism of primary resistance to TKI therapy, and to identify strategies to increase the rate that patients remain in molecular remission after discontinuation of TKI therapy, possibly representing permanent cure of the disease. The Scientific Premise of this Project is that new and clinically relevant insights into the biology of CML and its response to therapy can be gained by a more physiologically accurate mathematical model of the disease. The first Aim of this Project will leverage UCI's extensive expertise in mathematical modeling of complex biological phenomena to develop more sophisticated models of CML that incorporate physiologically relevant homeostatic feedback and feedforward regulatory interactions between normal and leukemic cells, and between stem cells and more differentiated cells. Optimal model structures will be vetted by a machine-based automated model selection process to arrive at a model that maintains appropriate stability and homeostasis, responds physiologically to stress and depletion of different cell compartments, and conforms to the limited existing qualitative data on CML hematopoiesis derived from mouse models and patient studies. In the second Aim, an innovative binary BCR-ABL1 transgenic mouse model will be used to determine for the first time the relevant parameters governing the production of the malignant blood cells in CML. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of normal and malignant hematopoietic stem/progenitor populations, including the heterogeneous multi-potential progenitor compartment, will generate important new knowledge about the heterogeneity of CML myelopoiesis and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of feedback/feedforward regulation. Based on these preclinical studies, a novel clinical trial to gain insight into similar cell kinetic parameters in CML patients will be initiated. In the final Aim, certain predictions from the validated mathematical model will be tested in the transgenic mouse model. Among the hypotheses that can be tested straightaway are that the original burden of leukemic stem cells governs the initial response to TKI therapy and represents and important prognostic factor, and that treatments that stimulate leukemic stem cell cycle entry are optimally delivered intermittently rather than continuously. Additional hypotheses emerging from the modeling effort will be tested in years 3-5 of the grant. Together, the studies proposed in this Project will provide critical new knowledge about the pathogenesis of CML, inform new therapeutic strategies, and set the stage for future interventional clinical trials in CML."

"9407015","PROJECT 1 ABSTRACT  Project 1 will develop combination photodynamic therapy (cPDT) for non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC),  including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). NMSC are currently treated by  surgical excision, but better alternatives are needed, especially for organ transplant patients who develop  frequent and aggressive SCC, and for Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome patients who develop hundreds of BCCs.  Previously, we discovered that biochemical manipulation with differentiating agents (methotrexate, vitamin D  [Vit D], and 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) enhances heme pathway activity and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) accumulation.  Those findings will now be translated into improved efficacy in the clinic. AIM 1 will examine cPDT for SCC (the  most lethal NMSC) using topical 5-FU prior to ALA and blue light. This is a clinical trial to test whether the  combination improves efficacy for SCC in-situ in patients at high risk for aggressive NMSC (patients with organ  transplants, or highly photodamaged skin). Skin biopsies and blood will be saved for use in Aim 3. AIM 2 will  investigate cPDT for BCC (the most prevalent of all cancers). PDT is hampered by a nonhomogeneous  photosensitizer (PpIX) distribution in tumors, but Vit D pretreatment induces a more homogenous distribution.  Patients with BCC will be pretreated with 5-FU, Vit D, or placebo followed by ALA for 4 hr. A skin biopsy will be  taken to assess PpIX distribution; tumors will then be treated with red light. Histological clearance of tumors at  3 months will be confirmed by surgical excision. AIM 3 will investigate new cPDT approaches and new assays  to help individualized patient treatments. Liposomal targeting nanoconstructs from Project 3 will be used to  deliver small molecule inhibitors against EGFR or VEGF/c-Met (along with photosensitizer BPD) in preclinical  models of BCC skin cancer, including a BCC skin explant model from Ptch1 +/- mice. The predictive value of  noninvasive monitoring of PpIX in patient skin (using optical tools developed in Project 4), and of measuring  p53 levels and thymidine synthase gene alleles, will be tested by correlation with lesion clearance rates in the  clinical studies. The preclinical studies will improve understanding of mechanisms and suggest future  approaches to individualize the treatments and maximize therapeutic responses to cPDT."
"9548103","Project Summary/Abstract Community pharmacies provide an ideal setting for identification of patients at risk for falls. North Carolina Medicaid claims data indicate that the population most in need of medication management services visit the pharmacy an average of 35 times annually, while only seeing their primary care physician 2-4 times annually. In the proposed project, we will use a prospective, cohort design to investigate an outpatient care model that links a network of community pharmacies (CPESN) with primary care practices. The CPESN pharmacies in the intervention group will (1) screen for risk of falling using questions from the STEADI Tool Kit, (2) conduct a comprehensive medication review with fall prevention education, and (3) refer to other members of the health care team for additional falls assessment. The CPESN intervention group will use a monthly attribution report to identify older adults at high risk for falls. This report includes the total number of medications and high-risk medications that each patient is taking as well as if the patient had a recent fall-related emergency department visit. CPESN pharmacies will use a shared software application, PHARMACeHOME, to communicate with primary care practices. In this project, PHARMACeHOME will be used for two primary purposes. First, pharmacists will make recommendations to minimize exposure to medications associated with an increased risk of falls identified in the comprehensive medication review. Second, pharmacists will refer for additional falls assessment that are beyond the scope of pharmacy practice. By utilizing the shared software application, we hope to alleviate several barriers to coordination of care. Outcomes achieved in the network (CPESN) pharmacies that implement the intervention will be compared to those achieved in two comparison groups: (1) CPESN pharmacies that do not implement the intervention, and (2) non-CPESN pharmacies in North Carolina. Data from the three cohorts will be analyzed to evaluate the falls intervention program on: (1) use of high-risk medications (primary outcome variable) and (2) the rate of fall-related emergency department visits (secondary outcome variable). For all patients, data will be collected 1-year before and 1-year after the index date, determined on the basis of when the patient is identified as using medications associated with an increased risk of falling. If successful, this community pharmacy-primary care linkage model could have huge implications on the health benefits, costs and sustainability to health care.      "
"9645121","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Loss of inflammation regulation is a biological event common to many human chronic inflammatory diseases including Type II diabetes mellitus, and periodontitis. A return to homeostasis (resolution of inflammation) requires cellular activation of a well-coordinated process mediated by endogenous lipids, including, resolvin E1 (RvE1), derived from the ?-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Activation of the G protein-coupled receptor, ChemR23, by the agonist ligand RvE1 is known to lead to attenuation of NF-KB mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines, dictating cellular fate and consequently resolution of inflammation. However, how ChemR23 in innate cells fails to activate resolution in chronic inflammatory diseases remains unclear. This proposal will test the hypothesis that ChemR23 expression and function are altered in chronic inflammatory diseases and that engineered agonist biomimetic antibodies to chemR23 can impact the inflammatory phenotype. To that end, four distinct but complementary specific aims are proposed. The mentored phase of the proposal will be carried out under Prof. Van Dyke at The Forsyth Institute. The goal of the K99 mentored phase is to: 1) characterize the expression of ChemR23 receptors on inflammatory cells (neutrophils and monocyte/macrophages) of subjects with Type II diabetes and/or periodontitis; 2) characterize the molecular pathways that are regulated by ChemR23 in disease. This training will provide expertise in inflammation biology, clinical pathology and proteomics. The understanding of ChemR23 in dictating the path chronic inflammation diseases investigated during the mentored phase will provide the foundation for transition to independent phase. Inflammation resolution is a rapidly emerging field of interest that would greatly benefit from unexplored biomimetic approaches to therapeutically regulate cell fate. Building on previous experience, the goal of R00 independent phase is to: 3) engineer agonist monoclonal antibody for ChemR23, and 4) to characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which therapeutic antibodies regulate inflammation through ChemR23 activation. This award includes a well-structured training program that provides course work and seminar learning experiences as well as ensuring protected research time during concurrent specialty training in Periodontology at Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Successful completion of this project will lead to better understanding of the molecular and cellular role of ChemR23, and to translate this knowledge for the development of agonist biomimetics to modulate inflammatory diseases clinically."
"9453147","Successful treatment of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) depends primarily on abstinence from alcohol. Different than addiction treatment where abstinence or even harm reduction may be an eventual goal with less need for immediate adherence, the complete abstinence requirement in this patient population makes it a useful model in which to test new strategies for efficient monitoring of patient behavior. Continuous monitoring of alcohol use by wearable biosensors is possible but to date these devices have not been used in clinical medical settings to monitor adherence to medical directives. For ALD patients such devices could facilitate monitoring of alcohol abstinence providing both patients and clinicians with real-time critical information to develop and adjust alcohol treatment plans. Our R21 proposal targets NIAAA PA 15-301 Alcohol Use Disorders: Behavioral Treatment, Services and Recovery Research soliciting proposals for co-morbid medical and alcohol use disorders specifically proposals using technology to develop and validate assessments capturing real-time data to use in clinical treatment paradigms.  We propose a 3 month RCT pilot of alcohol biosensor monitoring (ABM)(WrisTAS-see methods) for patients with decompensated ALD who intend to stop drinking. All participants will wear the ABM device but participants will be randomized to receive either personalized feedback on the data recorded on the device (n=30) or enhanced usual care without feedback on device data (n=30). We will determine whether ABM plus feedback improves outcomes for ALD compared to enhanced usual care and hypothesize ABM feedback will reduce alcohol consumption, improve motivation and self-efficacy for abstinence and improve engagement in treatment. We will also conduct research including quantitative and qualitative data collected from participants and 15 clinical stakeholders (e.g. physicians, nurse practitioners, care coordinators) who will provide opinions on ABM feasibility, acceptability, and usability. Qualitative methods are especially useful for understanding the perceived needs, barriers, and preferences for monitoring alcohol use and are especially required for future translation of this technology into clinical practice. Additionally this study will inform our development of a full scale project by 1) determining the potential for ABM clinical integration 2) identifying barriers to ABM implementation 3) determining long term wearability of ABM devices and 4) determine whether identified patient outcome effect sizes appear clinically meaningful to justify ABM monitoring and evaluation in a full-scale randomized controlled trial in the clinical environment."
"9438781","The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to understand the causes of chronic asthma and thereby improve diagnosis and therapy of this common and debilitating ailment. We showed previously how innate immune activation in response to fungal infection of the airway is linked to the development of T helper 2 (TH2)- biased allergic airway inflammation and associated diseases (asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis). Fungi are ubiquitous in human environments and readily gain access to the airway mucosal membrane through constant inhalation of conidia (spores). We have shown that fungi isolated from the human airway can cause airway hyperreactivity in mice, suggesting that airway fungal growth, i.e., airway mycosis, activates innate and acquired immune responses that could cause asthma in susceptible individuals. This is further supported by our discovery in mice that secreted fungal proteinases cleave fibrinogen in the airways to form cleavage products (FCPs) that activate Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) to induce fungistatic innate immune responses. However, how these factors mediate allergic inflammation in the lungs remain unknown. Our central hypothesis states that fungal proteinase-mediated cleavage of fibrinogen initiates allergic airway disease and fungistatic innate immune responses in the airways. We will test this hypothesis through the following Aims: 1) Determine the molecular mechanism by which FCPs initiate allergic inflammation and antifungal immunity through TLR4. Hypotheses: Fungal proteinases cleave fibrinogen to yield FCPs that 1) signal through TLR4 via the CD18-CD11b integrin heterodimer (Mac-1) to 2) activate STAT6 and NF-?B. We will use mice with constitutive and targeted deletions of STAT6, NF-?B, and Mac-1 as well as mice harboring a mutation in the fibrinogen gamma chain that prevents binding to Mac-1 to test our hypothesis, confirming our findings using human monocyte derived macrophages. 2) Determine how FCPs initiate allergic inflammation and antifungal immunity through airway epithelia of asthmatics. Hypotheses: 1) Epithelial cells secrete coagulant factors in response to fungal proteinases 2) FCPs initiate allergic and anti-fungal responses mediated by enhanced secretion of airway coagulant factors by airway epithelial cells. We will determine the physiological significance of FCP-mediated induction of clotting factors (e.g., fibrinogen, prothrombin) regarding antifungal immunity and chronic allergic inflammation using animal models of asthma and human airway epithelial cells. 3) Determine the mechanism of innate antifungal immune dysfunction in asthmatics with airway mycosis. Hypothesis: Immune cells from a subset of patients with moderate to severe asthma and airway mycosis are unable to restrain fungal growth in vitro. We will examine the fungistatic ability of human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) against fungal conidia. To resolve the signatures of effective and ineffective innate immune responses to fungi in asthmatics, we will study extreme phenotypes, performing differential transcriptome analyses of HMDM in response to fungal conidia by RNA sequencing."
"9437696","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HSF1 is the key transcriptional regulator of heat shock protein synthesis that defines the response to hyperthermia, and affects resistance to certain conventional drugs and radiation. Recently, based on both model and population studies, Hsf1 has emerged as a major factor in breast cancer development. We have demonstrated that HSF1 plays an essential role in malignant transformation and maintenance of cancer cells by controlling oncogene-induced senescence, and tumor angiogenesis. To advance our understanding of oncogenesis and radiation resistance, and to rationally target Hsf1 in specific cancer types, here we will address fundamental questions: (1) what are the key mechanisms of Hsf1 activation in Her2-positive cancer, (2) how does Hsf1 affect development and progression of Her2-positive breast cancer, and (3) what is the role of HSF1 in resistance to ionizing radiation. Aim 1 will address how HSF1 is regulated in mammary tumorigenesis. We will elucidate whether Hsf1 is constitutively activated in tumors because of aneuploidy-associated proteotoxicity by co-opting the signal transduction pathways observed in the heat shock response, or as a part of conventional HER2- mediated cancer signaling. In Aim 2, we will clarify how Hsf1 enters functional complexes in response to Her2, and affects global transcription. We will then elucidate the role of transcription mediated by HSF1 in the cancer cells, establishing HSF1 as a cancer stem cell factor, a player in epithelial/mesenchymal transition and a determinant of tumor metastasis (Aim 3). Finally, we will establish how Hsf1 determines cancer responses to ionizing radiation by testing a hypothesis that radiation resistance is linked to Hsf1-mediated control of cancer stem cells."
"9407017","ABSTRACT: Project 3-Mechanism-based Design of Combination Therapies for Pancreatic Cancer  Project 3 develops mechanism and imaging-based combinations with photodynamic therapy (PDT) using novel  nanoconstructs (NCs) in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer (PanCa), a disease with dismal statistics and  tenacious resistance to current therapies. The promise of PDT in clinical and preclinical studies for PanCa in  the previous cycle, our own findings in the current cycle, and collaborations within and outside the Program for  efficient clinical translation, motivate the current investigations. The underlying hypothesis recognizes that the  multiple growth/survival pathways of cancer development and progression demand an approach to  combination treatments that exploits interactive mechanisms to achieve meaningful improvements in PanCa  management. The strategy is to design combinations in which the first treatment primes/sensitizes the cancer  cell for the second and can also be co-delivered, if warranted, for synergistic outcomes. The goals of the  Project will be realized in 4 aims, interact heavily with the clinical projects, and build on our published and  preliminary data showing superior control of local and metastatic PanCa with certain PDT-based combinations.  Aim 1 will establish, in a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model (Bardeesy Lab), the optimal schedule for  a new combination treatment with (benzoporphyrin derivative, BPD)-PDT (FDA approved for AMD, in clinical  studies for PanCa) and MM398, (liposomal irinotecan, Merrimack Pharma) a topisomerase I inhibitor that is  FDA approved for colorectal cancer and is in phase III PanCa clinical trials. Assisted by a collaboration with  Merrimack Pharma, the results of the PDT + MM-398 combination from Aim 1 will be rapidly translated within  the funding cycle to clinical studies via Project 2, and could significantly impact the management of PanCa.  Recognizing the need for appropriately timed and targeted combinations and based on preliminary data, Aim 2  takes a more forward-looking approach to synthesize EGFR-targeted multi-inhibitor containing liposomal NCs  (TLNCs) for co-delivery of BPD and either a chemotherapeutic (SN-38) or a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor  (XL184, a dirty inhibitor of VEGFR2, c-MET and EGFR pathways) to target key PanCa molecular pathways.  To further enhance crosstalk within the Program, TLNCs containing Erlotinib will be developed for preclinical  evaluation in non-melanoma skin cancers via Project 1 for eventual testing in humans. The optimal surface  density of Erbitux will be established in vivo in collaboration with Project 4 and Core C. Aim 3 will test the  optimized SN-38/XL184 TLNCs in sophisticated 3D heterocellular models that replicate stromal-cancer cell  interactions, and will identify the most cytotoxic and selective constructs for testing in vivo. Aim 4 will evaluate  the optimal cell line-specific TLNC from Aim 3 in orthotopic models of PanCa to assess acute tumor burden  reduction (local and metastatic) with Core B and survival enhancement following combination treatment (PDT  + SN-38/XL184). These novel targeted multi-agent constructs will form the basis of future clinical trials. Cores  B and C provide imaging, pathology and statistical support."
"9542458","Project Summary AIMM 2018 annual meeting ? E.M. Shore, P.I. Advances in Mineral Metabolism (AIMM) is an annual conference that combines presentations on bone and musculoskeletal biology research in a format that provides extensive opportunity for open discussions and exchange of ideas from basic, clinical, and translational perspectives. The AIMM meeting has been embraced by a broad spectrum of scientists and clinicians who have gathered for more than 30 consecutive years to participate in the high quality discussions of state-of-the-art topics that are the core of the spirit of AIMM. From its start in 1985, the AIMM meeting has been an important and unique scientific meeting, distinguished by cutting edge reports and intensive scientific discussions. A unique feature of AIMM has consistently been to use half of each presentation time slot for lively and engaging discussion. The AIMM program has consistently maintained balance in basic research and clinical perspectives and is attended by academics (basic researchers and clinicians), postdoctoral trainees, and by scientists working in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition to high quality scientific discussion, a major goal of the AIMM meeting is to provide opportunities for young scientists to interact closely with more established researchers in a welcoming and interactive environment that fosters creative scientific exchange and encourages their career development. AIMM accomplishes this through a number of mechanisms: first, all Young Investigator awardees present their work orally within the planned scientific sessions; second, the program includes an open basic science session and an open clinical science session that provide young investigators additional opportunities to present recent findings or case reports; third, each session includes time for extended discussions and participation of young investigators is encouraged; fourth, meet-the-professor sessions provide unique opportunities for small-group interaction that particularly benefit scientists-in-training and young faculty; finally, the format of the meeting brings attendees together throughout the day including time for unstructured informal group and individual discussions. The 2018 AIMM meeting will be held from April 9-13, 2018 at the Stonebridge Inn in Snowmass Village, Colorado. The program will include basic science and clinical/translational oral presentations on relevant and new research including osteoimmunology, craniofacial skeletal development, nutrition and bone, rare bone diseases of heterotopic ossification and osteochondromas, second generation osteoporosis treatments, and skeletal and non-skeletal roles of PTHrP. Presentations and discussions by scientists and clinicians with expertise in these areas, as well as by young investigators who have been selected through a competitive process, will be a focus of the meeting. Invited speakers will lead meet-the-professor discussions on scientific and career development topics. The requested funds for the 2018 annual meeting would be a significant contribution toward fulfilling AIMM's goals to stimulate creativity in bone and musculoskeletal research and to provide young investigators with strong and lasting support to promote and develop their talent. 1"
"9475339","We propose to generate, validate and distribute the second version of the Xenopus ORFeome, which we define as a fully sequenced, validated set of Xenopus cDNA clones containing one each of every open reading frame (ORF) encoded in the genome, in a format in which any ORF sequence can be easily transferred using recombineering into a diverse array of expression vectors. This one set of reagents will greatly decrease the time to characterize any protein in the myriad functional assays carried out by the entire Xenopus community. But most importantly, an ORFeome set will allow high-throughput in vivo functional-genomic screening in manner currently not feasible, which is a particular strength of the Xenopus system where functional screens have been the basis of a number of fundamental biological observations. Our consortium completed the first phase of this project where we moved 90% of the available full-length cDNA clones to Gateway compatible vectors. However, because of limitations of the original Xenopus EST projects this represents only half of all of the ORFs in the genome. In this project we will de novo clone the remaining Xenopus ORFs to a Gateway donor vector to generate the only available cDNA clones for over half the genome. These clones will be made available, without restriction, to researchers worldwide. The Xenopus community is fully supportive of this project and at a recent PI meeting (MBL (Woodshole), September 2015) the ORFeome was voted as the Top priority of needed Xenopus resources."
"9480088","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite progress in efficacious treatments for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), few interventions are available for disease-specific impairments. The complexity and heterogeneity of ASD suggests interventions targeting multiple domains are more likely to have a therapeutic impact. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award supports the candidate's long-term goals of building effective interventions for core symptoms in ASD with capacity to integrate the rapidly evolving findings from both behavioral intervention and drug discovery research. The training program and supervised activities will focus on gaining expertise in the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying phenotypic diversity in ASD, interrogating active ingredients from combination therapies, and investigating mechanisms underlying both behavioral and pharmacological treatments. The award is will be based at the Rush University Medical Center under the mentorship of Dr. Mark Pollack and co-mentorship of Drs. Ed Cook, Luan Phan, and Don Hedeker at the University of Illinois-Chicago; and with consultation from national experts including Drs. Connie Kasari (University of California, Los Angeles), Linmarie Sikich (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill), and Kevin Pelphrey (Yale School of Medicine). The candidate's immediate focus is to study a novel, behavioral- pharmacological therapy targeting higher-order social information processing impairments in youth with ASD. The research plan proposes a proof-of-concept, combination intervention designed to address individual treatment targets presumed to influence social learning in school aged children with ASD. This proposal builds upon data from the applicant's randomized, comparative trial of a targeted cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI) for nonverbal communication, emotion recognition, and theory of mind deficits in youth with ASD. We will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of combining the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) with the targeted CBI group curriculum. The research plan will randomize 8-11 year old youth with ASDs (n=50), into a 12- session, randomized, parallel group design of CBI+OT or a control social group condition (facilitated play). It is hypothesized that targeted, intranasal OT dosing immediately prior to CBI group activities will serve enhance social cognition during group and homework activities, facilitate behavioral rehearsal of target skills, and yield changes in both behavioral and cognitive domains supporting social learning during childhood. In collaboration with the mentorship team, the research plan will investigate a candidate task battery drawing from neuroscience measurement strategies of brain-behavior relationships underlying social cognition and affective regulation. The candidate task battery will be used refine treatment targets and identify potential social cognitive mechanisms predicting treatment response from the combined social cognitive intervention."
"9437806","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Mortality rates related to brain and other Central Nervous System (CNS) cancers have held steady over the last three or four decades, despite tremendous advancements in our knowledge about the biology, diagnosis, and treatment of brain cancer. Further progress in early diagnosis and treatment is likely to be associated, in part, with improving computational models that are used ubiquitously for analyzing and segmenting brain tumors. Clinical applications continue to necessitate improved segmentation of hard-to- detect poorly enhanced, multi-foci and small tumors that are surrounded by multiple abnormal tissues such as edema, necrosis and cysts. In addition, computational models need to be improved for handling diffusive boundaries among different tissue types for robust Brain Tumor Segmentation (BTS). Furthermore, in an effort to reduce cognitive sequelae, contemporary protocols employ risk-adapted therapy in which risk stratification is based on the volume of residual tumor after surgical resection and the presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis. Therefore, further improvement in cancer outcomes, particularly among children, is unlikely to be achieved without improved quantitation of tumor volume. Furthermore, replicating advanced computer algorithms across different imaging centers, studies, patient populations (adult and pediatric) and equipment is a persistent problem for the entire field of computational medical imaging.  Consequently, the overall hypothesis of this proposed research project is that a robust automatic BTS and other abnormal and normal brain tissue segmentation can be developed for quantitation and tracking of tumor volume which, in turn, will help improve early diagnosis, follow- up and treatment of CNS tumors. The proposed project aims to focus on principled computational modeling using a huge amount of neuroimaging datasets for BTS that are becoming prevalent, especially from the National Cancer Institute's sponsored Brain Tumor Segmentation (BRATS) challenges (http://www.braintumorsegmentation.org). This goal will be accomplished via the following aims: (1) Identify novel features, multiclass (tissue) feature selection and segmentation of hard-to-detect tumors and associated abnormalities using multimodal MRIs from different imaging centers; (2) Enable robust segmentation of tumor, other abnormal and normal tissues and tacking of brain tumor by fusing atlas-based tumor segmentation (ABTS) and feature-based BTS (FBTS); (3) implement software integration into a widely available tool (3D Slicer) available via multiple NIH sponsored Resource Centers such as the Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC), the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC), and the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT), for wider dissemination of BTS tool; and (4) Validate and evaluate our integrated BTS tool to quantify improvements in the detectability, sensitivity and specificity, and corresponding errors."
"9422717","Statins improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality presumably secondary to their inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase leading to decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, some of statins? CV benefits appear to be independent of decreases in LDL-C. These pleiotropic benefits are similar to those observed with mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade, leading us to hypothesize: statin therapy reduces aldosterone (ALDO) and this reduction contributes to some of statins? cardiovascular benefits. Thus, this proposal focuses on statins? effects on aldosterone regulation. This hypothesis is supported by our strong preliminary data. In two observational studies, statin use was associated with a ~30% decrease in ALDO levels at baseline and after angiotensin II (AngII) or upright posture as well as a decrease in systolic blood pressure and salt-sensitivity of blood pressure. Further, lipophilic statins were more potent than hydrophilic statins. In our preliminary studies to assess mechanism, we showed that addition of a statin to incubates of acutely isolated rat zona glomerulosa cells decreased baseline and AngII- stimulated ALDO production, without affecting corticosterone. Simvastatin (a lipophilic statin) reduced ALDO more than pravastatin (a hydrophilic statin). Thus, our overall hypothesis is that ALDO levels are reduced by statins, particularly lipophilic statins, leading to decreased cardiovascular injury and that the mechanism for the ALDO reduction involves inhibition by statins of the last step in aldosterone biosynthesis. To address this hypothesis we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. To perform a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in humans testing the hypothesis that statins reduce ALDO levels, with a lipophilic statin having greater efficacy than a hydrophilic statin. Aim 2. To test the hypothesis, in rats, that a key mechanism underlying the adrenal effects of statins is the inhibition of ALDO synthase (CYP11B2) through changes in enzyme activity and/or levels. Aim 3. To test the hypothesis, in a rat model of ALDO-dependent cardiovascular injury, that a lipophilic statin will reduce cardiac damage. Currently, the beneficial effects of statins are generally assumed to be secondary to their LDL-C lowering effects. If our hypothesis proves to be true, it will substantially shift the focus of how to enhance statins? beneficial effects from a singular approach on reducing lipid levels to a dual approach of lowering ALDO and LDL-C. These results could provide an answer as to why some statins produce a beneficial cardiovascular effect when LDL-C levels are already normal or low, and why some statins that reduce LDL-C levels less than other statins have greater protective effects. Finally, for new drug development, our results will shift the focus from creating molecules that are simply better at lowering LDL-C to ones that are better optimized to lower both LDL-C and ALDO."
"9418538","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Arterial disease is the leading cause of morbidity/mortality in Metabolic syndrome (MetS). This occurs early as evidenced by arterial dysfunction that, in turn, raises blood pressure and glucose. Health organizations recommend exercise in an intensity based manner to promote cardiovascular adaptation and prevent disease. Metformin is a common anti-diabetes medication that reduces future type 2 diabetes and CVD risk. However, the optimal exercise dose to be combined with metformin for additive effects on vascular function is unknown. Based on our preliminary work, our overall hypothesis is that metformin blunts adaptation following high intensity exercise training (HiEx) by lowering mitochondrial derived oxidative stress signaling. We further hypothesize that low intensity exercise (LoEx) training combined with metformin will promote additive effects on vascular function compared to LoEx or HiEx+metformin, and maintain/improve non-exercise physical activity patterns. In this double-blind trial, obese 30-60y MetS patients will be randomized to: 1) LoEx+placebo; 2) LoEx+metformin, 3) HiEx+placebo; or 4) HiEx+metformin for 16 weeks. We will evaluate measures of arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity and augmentation index), and nitric oxide-mediated arterial function in conduit (flow mediated dilation), resistance (post-ischemic flow velocity) and microvascular (contrast enhanced ultrasound) vessels, before and during a euglycemic clamp pre and post intervention (AIM 1). We will also assess 24 hr blood pressure as well as determine skeletal muscle metabolic insulin resistance and glucose tolerance (AIM 2) to address clinical and experimental questions related to health care. Further, we will examine the effect of metformin on exercise adherence, non-exercise physical activity and quality of life during the 16 week intervention as well as during an 8 week ?free-living? period (Exploratory AIM 3) to improve public health physical activity recommendations when co-prescribed medication. If these hypothesis are correct, they will indicate 1) whether and how metformin should be combined with physical activity for CVD prevention, 2) provide the first indication of whether exercise intensity reduces CVD risk via multi-level vasculature function vs. metabolic insulin action, 3) provide a rational early treatment for people with MetS. Thus, identification of the optimal drug to exercise interaction will illuminate how to develop individualized exercise/metformin prescriptions to correct vascular and ameliorate metabolic insulin resistance that attenuate/prevent progression to future diabetes and the CV morbidity and mortality."
"9542418","ABSTRACT Since 1980, the biennial Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Musculoskeletal Biology and Bioengineering has been the leading forum for the presentation and discussion of new and unpublished information in the field. Because of the ample opportunity for discussion and interaction, this meeting has invariably led to new collaborations, initiatives and research directions, and post-conference evaluations consistently rate the conference as ?outstanding.? Funds are requested for partial support of the 2018 Musculoskeletal Biology and Bioengineering GRC to be held again at Proctor Academy in Andover, NH, a calm, scenic, and isolated site that fosters maximum interactions between the participants. The theme for the 2018 GRC is ?The Elements of Motion? and the program is designed to feature the linked continuum of contributors to human motion: molecules, cells, tissues and cognitive control. This theme highlights the potential for the interdisciplinary field of musculoskeletal (MSK) biology and bioengineering to incorporate the newest ideas and technologies to preserve, restore, and perfect MSK health and motion. By bringing together and isolating for 5 days an eclectic combination of scientists, engineers, and clinicians from academia, government, industry and non-profit organizations, the proposed GRC promises to address this matter in a deep and substantial way. The meeting will consist of 9 sessions (all plenary and involving invited speakers) and 2 poster sessions. Afternoons will be free for interactive recreation and discussion; the total number of attendees is capped at 180 to encourage interaction. The GRC will be preceded by a two-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) at the same location. Funds are requested for partial support of this GRS, whose theme ?Biological Insight to Accelerate Musculoskeletal Research? builds on the GRC, with an attendance of 50 individuals expected, most of whom will attend the GRC. The co-Chairs of the GRS are working closely with the Chair and Vice-Chair of the GRC to develop the program, which will include a mentoring component focused on traditional and non-traditional career pathways in MSK research. In addition to a keynote session and a career panel, the GRS will feature research of new investigator attendees in 2 oral sessions and 2 poster sessions. The Chair and Vice-Chair of the GRC will both attend, as will a number of other GRC attendees, who will be integrated into the program to share their insights. Both the GRC and GRS will strive to involve women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities."

"9447720","Differential sensitivity to the acute effects of alcohol, particularly reduced sedation-like effects and enhanced stimulation-like effects (here simplified as ?low sensitivity;? LS), is known to be a potent risk factor for alcohol abuse, dependence, and drinking-contingent adverse consequences. However, at present relatively little is known concerning the specific psychological mechanisms through which LS promotes problematic drinking. The research proposed here is aimed at testing a novel translational hypothesis, based in the incentive sensitization theory of addiction, linking LS with specific psychological and neurobiological processes that both promote craving and motivation for alcohol and facilitate heavy drinking. The proposed research will use a combination of laboratory-based measures to gauge attention to, motivation for, and incentive value of alcohol- related cues (alcohol cue-reactivity; ACR) and ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of ?real-world? drinking and related experiences. Participants will be young drinkers (ages 18-20 years) recruited from the community, permitting investigation of a novel, theory-driven model of risk for problematic drinking during a critical developmental period for alcohol involvement (emerging adulthood). Using a variety of recruitment channels, we will screen potential participants to obtain information about their level of alcohol sensitivity (as determined using validated questionnaires) and drinking patterns. A target sample of 420 emerging adults (70 males and 70 females in each of three sensitivity terciles) will be invited to participate in a laboratory session during which four tasks will be used to evaluate ACR: (1) a visual dot-probe detection task assessing involuntary capture of attention by alcohol cues; (2) an alcohol approach-avoidance task evaluating implicit approach bias elicited by alcohol cues; (3) amplitude of the P3 event-related potential elicited by alcohol cues, assessing incentive value for alcohol; and (4) an olfactory cue exposure task measuring self-reported craving for alcohol. Following this laboratory session, participants will begin a 21-day EMA period during which they will use a smartphone app to record alcohol cue exposure, alcohol craving, drinking behaviors, and adverse consequences of drinking in their natural environments. Participants will complete an online follow-up survey one year after the laboratory session. The research will permit us to (a) characterize how individual differences in alcohol sensitivity relate to neurobehavioral and self-report measures of incentive sensitization processes; (b) investigate how LS relates to drinking behavior, ACR, craving, and problems in young drinkers' natural environments; and (c) evaluate empirical associations among alcohol sensitivity, laboratory endophenotypes, ecologically assessed drinking experiences, and problematic drinking outcomes. This approach will produce a unique and rich dataset, findings from which will help fill critical gaps in extant knowledge about the etiology of LS-related risk for AUD."
"9539382","Project Summary Perinatal asphyxia (PA) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the time of birth. In patients born with PA, many develop moderate or severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and 20 to 30% will develop long term effects including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, mental retardation, or learning disability. PA is difficult to prevent or predict, and the current treatment strategy of therapeutic hypothermia only offers a 15% absolute reduction in the risk of death and disability. Thus, strategies to identify a therapeutic window or improve therapeutic efficacy have significant clinical potential. Inflammation is implicated in the development of HIE and is a useful therapeutic target since it broadly describes multiple pathways which perpetuate and increase the severity of injury. In neuroinflammation, microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, adopt an activated phenotype with increased phagocytic behavior. Previous studies have leveraged this effect to demonstrate increased small molecule, specifically dendrimer nanoparticle, uptake within microglia in injured tissue. Accumulation of drug-loaded dendrimers in microglia, mediators of HIE injury, allows for targeted delivery of a therapeutic payload. Curcumin, our proposed therapeutic, has been shown by our lab to have significant neuroprotective effect in a rat model of neonatal HIE due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. We will formulate two dendrimer conjugates, a fluorescent Cy5-dendrimer particle and a drug loaded Cy5-dendrimer- curcumin particle, using established chemistries. We will use Cy5-dendrimers to evaluate the timeline of microglia activation in response to injury in the neonatal rat model, finding time points of peak microglial activation by immunohistochemistry (semi-quantification based on phenotype and dendrimer-Cy5 co-localization) and fluorescent activated cell sorting (quantification based on antibody expression and Cy5 fluorescence). Using these same techniques, we will then evaluate microglial response to therapeutic dendrimer administration after systemic injection of the curcumin-loaded conjugate. This project will provide key answers including (1) the ideal time to provide therapeutic intervention after ischemic injury for suppression of inflammation, and (2) the ability of anti-inflammatory therapeutics to reverse injury on a cellular level. The overall goal of this project is to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of engineered dendrimer nanoparticles in neonatal HIE during a determined optimal therapeutic window. Identifying the injury timeline and a nanoparticle platform to leverage the disease pathophysiology will lead to improved therapeutic intervention in neonatal brain injury, with implications that can be translated to adult neurological disorders, where inflammation also plays a critical role."
"9659398","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a general lack of understanding concerning the molecular signaling pathways that are altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and whether dysregulation of these pathways contributes to impairments in synaptic plasticity and memory deficits associated with AD. The studies in this competing renewal are focused on the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2? and the protein kinases that phosphorylate it. eIF2? has four known protein kinases: the general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2), the double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase (PKR), heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), and the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein kinase (PERK). The phosphorylation of eIF2? on serine 51 causes a decrease in general translation initiation, but it also selectively increases the translation of a subset of mRNAs that contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5' untranslated region (UTR). Previous studies showed that eIF2? phosphorylation increased in the brains of AD model mice and postmortem brains from AD patients, suggesting that increased eIF2? phoshorylation decreases general translation and upregulates the translation of mRNAs with uORFs in their UTRs in AD. Consistent with this notion, in the previous funding period we found that genetic deletion of PERK prevents decreases in general translation, increased expression of ATF4 (whose mRNA contains a uORF), impairments in synaptic plasticity, and memory deficits in AD model mice. Based on these observations, we have formulated a central hypothesis, which is that elevated eIF2? phosphorylation in AD via activation of multiple eIF2? kinases results in impaired synaptic plasticity and memory deficits due to differential mRNA translation and protein expression. To test this hypothesis, we will 1) determine whether genetic deletion of GCN2 and PKR prevents altered translational control and amyloidogenesis in AD model mice, 2) determine whether genetic deletion of GCN2 and PKR prevents aging-related impairments in synaptic plasticity and memory deficits displayed by AD model mice, and 3) determine the identity of proteins with altered synthesis and expression in AD model mice and in eIF2? kinase mutant mice. These studies will provide important information concerning whether reduction of eIF2? phosphorylation via deletion of GCN2 and/or PKR can correct dysregulated translation, impaired synaptic plasticity, and memory deficits in AD model mice in a manner similar to the deletion of PERK, and whether these eIF2? kinases might be suitable therapeutic targets for AD. Moreover, these studies have the potential to identify additional targets by identifying the proteins with dysregulated translation in the brains of AD mice, as well as the proteins whose translation is regulated by each eIF2? kinase."

"9408649","Working memory has traditionally been characterized as providing temporary memory storage and guidance of ongoing behavior and depending on recurrent excitation of prefrontal neurons. It is hypothesized that N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists interfere with working memory. The NMDAR antagonist, ketamine, can produce in healthy humans temporary deficits in working memory performance and accompanying prefrontal activation. Theories and preclinical research link these phenomena to cortical disinhibition. However, these theories have not been tested in humans because no imaging modality could appropriately quantify both the deficits in working memory related activation and performance and putative changes in baseline cortical metabolism. Recently, a technique called calibrated functional magnetic resonance imaging has become available for use in humans. We propose to use this technique in healthy persons to measure baseline cortical oxidative metabolism. This method will be combined with conventional functional magnetic resonance imaging and a spatial working memory paradigm to measure working memory deficits during infusion with the NMDAR antagonist ketamine. We will test three key hypotheses: 1) that the NMDAR antagonist ketamine increases prefrontal cortical oxidative metabolism as measured with calibrated fMRI; 2) that increases in prefrontal cortical oxidative metabolism are related to decreases in working- memory related activation measured with conventional functional magnetic resonance imaging; and 3) that increases in prefrontal cortical oxidative metabolism are related to reductions in working memory accuracy. The results of this study would increase understanding of working memory deficits and could be helpful in developing and testing novel therapeutics for working memory dysfunction. They may be particularly important in schizophrenia because there is strong evidence of glutamatergic dysfunction in the disorder and working memory function predicts functional recovery."
"9527580","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This K23 proposal from Dr. Patricia Gruner, a clinical psychologist at Yale University, examines causal reasoning abnormalities in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) ? a critical step towards the long-term goal of developing therapeutic remediation precisely targeting cognitive and neural system dysfunction in patients with clinically significant obsessions and compulsions. Concurrently, the accompanying training and mentorship plan will support the PI?s progression towards independence, with a focus on neuroscience-based therapeutic development.  Individuals with OCD engage in maladaptive repetitive behaviors reflecting erroneous causal beliefs about the environment. Large knowledge gaps remain regarding causal reasoning deficits in OCD, and the neurobiology of this core clinical abnormality remains unclear. Causal reasoning is a complex construct relying on several distinct underlying computations, including the ability to learn contingencies and to represent abstract outcomes. These computations are difficult to dissociate in real-world situations using existing neurocognitive assessments. To close this knowledge gap, we have developed a neurobiologically-informed behavioral paradigm designed to disambiguate these specific elements of causal reasoning. The paradigm is optimized in conjunction with state-of-the-art neuroimaging to test the hypothesis that behavioral and neural signals of specific contingency learning versus outcome representation differ in OCD relative to matched controls. In turn, we will quantify relationships between symptoms (dimensionally assessed through a battery of well-validated clinical measures), neural signals, and behavioral measure of specific contingency learning and outcome representation. Thus, this project advances our understanding of OCD neurobiology and provides the foundation for treatment development around precise neurobiologically-grounded computations ? a longer-term career objective of the PI. In turn, the outlined training support facilitates the PI?s transition towards independence.  Dr. Gruner has extensive clinical and cognitive assessment expertise working with OCD patients. She received postdoctoral training in neuroimaging and cognitive remediation at Yale. This proposal is designed to develop deep expertise in neuroimaging acquisition and analysis techniques with a focus on state-of-the-art protocols developed by the Human Connectome Project, increase knowledge of OCD neurobiology, and advanced skills in task-based imaging using model-based analyses. The PI has assembled an exceptional mentoring team. The primary mentor, Dr. Christopher Pittenger, Director of the Yale OCD Research Clinic, is world-renowned for translational research on OCD and related disorders. Dr. Bruce Wexler, an expert in neuroplasticity and development of neurocognitive interventions, will provide co-mentorship regarding neurocognitive function in OCD. The PI will receive training from Dr. Alan Anticevic, a leading clinical neuroimager, and Dr. Daeyeol Lee, an expert in the mathematical modeling of complex behavioral data. Dr. Rajita Sinha, Chief of the Psychology Section in the Department of Psychiatry at Yale, will provide additional professional mentorship. This proposal supports the PI?s transition to independence via complementary neuroimaging and theoretical skills, facilitating pursuit of R01 funding focused on neuroscience-based therapeutics in OCD."
"9470593","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Peripheral neurons extend axons that reside in a collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) called the endoneurium that is produced by endoneurial fibroblast-like cells (EFLCs). Axons are further assembled into fascicles, each surrounded by the perineurium, a cellular structure that provides critical protection from toxins and mechanical stress. The signaling molecule Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) is secreted by Schwann Cells and binds to target cells to activate Gli1, a transcriptional effector of the sonic hedgehog pathway. Dhh is known to be critical for the development of the perineurium but its other roles in PNS development and maintenance are not known. In settings where Dhh expression is reduced or absent, including nerve injury, peripheral nerve fascicles reorganize into many smaller compartments called minifascicles. These structures are thought to be protective in the injury setting and possibly aid in nerve repair ? their precise roles in regeneration and the mechanisms responsible for their development remain unclear. By genetically labeling Gli1-expressing cells, we have identified PG and, unexpectedly, a population of EFLCs, as hedgehog-responsive in the PNS. Knocking out Gli1 leads to a reduction in endoneurial collagen and a phenotypic switch in EFLCs to form minifascicles. Both of these findings were also noted in Dhh knockouts, supporting a model in which Dhh-Gli1 signaling normally inhibits minifascicle formation by EFLCs. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the function of Gli1 in EFLCs in the developing, mature, and injured peripheral nerve. First, we will examine Gli1 knockout nerves for changes in composition of the endoneurial ECM and defects in axon-SC relationships. Second, we will use genetic tools to activate or block hedgehog signaling in this population in the adult PNS and look for changes in EFLC morphology and ECM composition. Third, we address the role of Gli1 signaling in these cells after sciatic nerve injury. We will perform nerve crush in wild-type mice and characterize changes in Dhh and Gli1 at both the transcript and protein levels. We will then compare peripheral nerve regeneration following crush injury in the setting of both Gli1 loss-of function and genetically sustained Gli1 expression. Finally, to definitively interrogate the role of these cells in the injury response, we will selectively express the diphtheria toxin receptor to allow their deletion prior to nerve injury. This work will substantially enhance our understanding of hedgehog signaling in the PNS and how perturbations in this signaling following nerve injury may affect repair and regeneration. !"
"9601214","PROJECT SUMMARY Dopamine (DA) plays key roles in the central nervous system by regulating a variety of physiological states, including cognition, motivation, and attention. While DA dysfunction is known to be involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders, its role in the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) as well as comorbidities associated with ASD (e.g. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) are largely unknown. The DA transporter (DAT) is a key constituent of DA signaling in the CNS and the principal regulator of DA homeostasis, mediating the active re-uptake of DA from the synapse following its release upon action potential depolarization. The research proposed focuses on understanding how rare variants (RVs) in the human DAT (hDAT) gene (SLC6A3) identified in several ASD subjects cause aberrant hDAT function and disrupted DA- associated behaviors. Importantly, this work will determine how RVs in hDAT support DA dysfunction, a complication associated with ASD. Our laboratory recently defined the first ASD identified de novo mutation in hDAT. This mutation located in the seventh transmembrane domain, a region critical to DA uptake and efflux, dramatically alters hDAT function both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, this de novo DAT mutation alters DA neurotransmission and DA-associated behaviors as observed in Drosophila melanogaster. The work presented in this proposal aims to create a novel set of discoveries exploiting the structural, functional and behavioral findings from the analysis of new hDAT variants identified in multiple individuals with ASD. We will (S.A. #1) engineer the hDAT ASD variants to determine their putative structural and functional deficits in heterologous expression systems. We will generate transgenic Drosophila lines expressing hDAT wildtype or hDAT variants specifically in DAergic neurons to determine the functional impairments of these hDAT variants in whole, intact Drosophila brains. We will use (S.A. #2) these transgenic Drosophila lines to evaluate the behavioral significance of hDAT dysfunction supported by these hDAT variants."
"9451623","PROJECT SUMMARY Osteoporosis and other diseases of skeletal fragility affect more than 200 million people worldwide and contributes to ~9 million factures annually. Preventing bone loss and/or restoring lost bone mass in patients is of vital importance to limiting the personal and economic impact of diseases of skeletal fragility. A key target in the stimulation of new bone formation is the protein sclerostin, an antagonist of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade, which is produced by bone embedded osteocytes. Numerous osteoanabolic cues, including mechanical load, reduce expression of the sclerostin leading to ?de-repression? of osteoblastogenesis and stimulation of de novo bone formation. However, key mechanistic details of how osteocytes sense mechanical load, transduce these load signals to biologic effectors, the identity of these biological effectors and how sclerostin bioavailability is regulated are unclear. Our preliminary data have uncovered a number of novel mediators of how osteocytes sense and respond to mechanical cues. Specifically, we show that microtubule- dependent cytoskeletal stiffness regulates mechano-activated Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, we implicate TRPV4 as a major mechano-dependent Ca2+ influx pathway that drives Ca2+ dependent activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKII) to reduce sclerostin bioavailability in the osteocyte. In the present grant, we will use in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models to determine the contribution of MT density and cytoskeletal crosslinking to osteocyte mechanosensing, define the contribution and mechanisms of osteocyte TRPV4 channel opening in response to mechanical stress and elucidate the mechanisms by which FFSS- dependent CamKII activation regulates sclerostin degradation and Sost gene transcription. This work will more fully explain the biological regulation of sclerostin, will mechanistically link several gaps in the knowledge of how osteocytes sense and respond to mechanical load, and will reveal novel targets to improve or preserve bone mass in aging and disease."
"9461600","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The role of the regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14) in the heart has never been studied, and we found that the RGS14 KO mice are protected from the adverse effects of acute and chronic ischemia, through angiogenesis/arteriogenesis, which protects from myocardial remodeling and development of heart failure. To accomplish the aims of this proposal, we will examine the following hypotheses:  Our first hypothesis is that disruption of RGS14 is a novel mechanism to protect the heart against chronic myocardial ischemia through angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. Our second hypothesis is that the mechanism of acute and chronic ischemic protection involves Gi?/AC/cAMP and Ras-mediated activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and consequently nitric oxide (NO)/VEGF activation, as well as blocking oxidative stress.  A particularly novel feature of the RGS14 Knockout (KO) mouse is its ability to protect against both acute and chronic myocardial ischemia and to induce arteriogenesis/angiogenesis. A second novel feature, that underlies the importance of studying inhibition of a gene with multiple effects, such as RGS14, is that it elicit these unusual protective effects mediated by several distal signaling pathways, which in their combination are likely more salutary than any one of the individual mechanisms."

"9431207","PROJECT ABSTRACT Corneal infections caused by the Gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common cause of contact lens wearing-associated infectious keratitis, and the fungus Candida albicans occur in the USA and worldwide, causing painful, sight-threatening disease. Furthermore, among all human P. aeruginosa infections, more than 13% are multidrug-resistant. This highlights the importance of better understanding the innate immune responses to opportunistic pathogens of the cornea. The objective of this proposal is to defining the protective role of the novel interleukin-36 subfamily of cytokines, close relatives of the IL-1 subfamily, in microbial keratitis and their targets, the dendritic cell. Our preliminary data show that IL-36?, ?, and their receptor IL-36R are required for a proper response to infection, and that down-regulation of their natural inhibitor, IL-36R antagonist, protects the cornea from P. aeruginosa infection. While the IL-1 subfamily is known as one of the most important mediators of innate immunity and inflammation and has been studied extensively with several drugs being developed from this body of research, little is known regarding the role of IL-36R in protective mucosal innate immunity. Based on the preliminary data and published studies, the hypothesis that IL-36R signaling promotes corneal innate defenses against microbial keratitis and antagonizes IL-1? in limiting infection-induced inflammation is postulated and will be tested with three specific aims: 1. To determine the expression and cellular sources of IL-36?, -36? and -36Ra and cell type(s) bearing IL- 36R in the cornea in response to microbial infection. This can be tested by assessing the cellular sources of IL- 36?, ?, and IL-36Ra, and cell types expressing IL-36R in the cornea during murine Pa- and Ca-infection using ELISA of epithelial and corneal extracts, immunohistochemistry. Primary human corneal epithelial cells will be used to assess the means by which IL-36 cytokines are secreted with particular focus on exosomes. The presence of IL-1 cytokines in corneal scrapings from keratitis patients will also be assessed. 2. To decipher the role(s) of IL-36 family members in corneal innate immune responses to infection in vivo and in vitro. This can be tested by assessing the role(s) of IL-36?, ? or IL-36R blockade (using neutralizing antibodies, siRNA, and/or genetic deletions) in mouse models of P. aeruginosa and C. albicans keratitis in vivo and bone marrow derived dendritic cell isolated from wild-type and knockout mice. 3. To assess the therapeutic potential of IL-36? on innate immunity, inflammation resolution, and/or angiogenesis in infected corneas. This can be tested by assessing the effects of topical application of IL-36? in combination with IL-1Ra on the outcome of microbial keratitis in B6 mice. The therapeutic potential of IL-36 stimulated, dendritic cell produced IL-23, and/or ?? T cell produced IL-22 will also be tested. The results from this proposal should improve our understanding of IL-36/IL-36R axis and dendritic cells in the regulation of corneal innate immunity at the molecular and cellular levels and may lead to the development of therapies that limit the progress/pathogenesis of microbial keratitis."
"9604885","Although it is generally assumed that the trillions of cells in a human body share identical DNA sequences, in reality we are a mosaic of genomes. The extent of this mosaicism is largely unknown, but both theoretical and empirical studies suggest that the burden of somatic mutations in humans is considerable. Indeed, in addition to cancer and ageing, two processes where somatic mutations are known to play an integral role, over thirty additional disease phenotypes are attributable to somatic variability. Somatic mutations have also been hypothesized to play a role in other complex diseases and account for some of the ?missing heritability? observed for many traits. Nonetheless, there have been few systematic and comprehensive studies of human somatic variability among tissues and individuals, and therefore the landscape of somatic mutations remains largely unknown. This gap in knowledge is a significant impediment to many ongoing and future studies of human phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility, such as the interpretation of somatic variability in cancer genome sequencing projects. To this end, the goals of the proposed project are to leverage the resources created by the GTEx Project to rigorously and systematically analyze patterns of human somatic variability. In Aim 1, we will perform deep exome sequencing on 15 tissues that have been collected from 40 individuals each (600 total exomes) and identify somatic sequence and structural variation. Importantly, we have carefully designed the study and particular tissues to study to facilitate testing biologically important hypotheses such as patterns and levels of somatic mutation and how these characteristics vary as a function of tissue type, age, and sex. Moreover, we will experimentally validate a large number of putative somatic mutations, which will allow filtering criteria to be adjusted resulting in a robust catalog of somatic mutations. In Aim 2, we will capitalize on the RNA-Seq data generated by the GTEx Project and use innovative approaches to test the hypothesis that somatic mutations contribute to gene expression variability. Collectively, these data will profoundly increase our understanding of human somatic mutations, their patterns and characteristics among tissues and individuals, and their influence on transcript abundance. Moreover, our data will be a considerable resource to the GTEx and scientific community, and we will make all project data easily accessible."
"9407016","SUMMARY OF PROJECT 2  The goal of this project is to transform the management of pancreatic cancer (PanCa), a devastating disease  that is most often diagnosed late, when curative therapies are no longer possible. Our strategy is to target the  disease at three key stages: premalignant, locally advanced and metastatic, using photodynamic therapy  (PDT) in combination with systemic therapy. We will build on our previous findings of PDT-induced tumor  necrosis in PanCa patients, developing new treatment strategies that combine PDT with appropriately  scheduled systemic chemotherapy to treat local and metastatic disease. We will also explore new treatment  options for early pancreatic malignancies and precursor lesions, including intraductal papillary mucinous  neoplasms (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) from which many PanCa arise. Following on from  our phase I clinical studies of CT-guided percutaneous PDT for locally advanced PanCa, Project 2 will move to  the minimally invasive approach of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided PDT, with the potential for outpatient  therapy with improved safety and healthcare costs. The goals will be realized in three aims. AIM 1 will  establish, in a phase II study, the efficacy of EUS-PDT using verteporfin (benzoporphyrin, BPD) to ablate solid  tumors of the pancreas. Clinical contrast CT-based treatment planning will be used to deliver patient-specific  PDT. This aim will also establish the safety of giving chemotherapy almost immediately after PDT. AIM 2 will  evaluate the novel combination of PDT and MM-398 (liposomal irenotecan, a topoisomerase inhibitor in phase  III trials for metastatic PanCa), using the optimized treatment schedule identified in Aim 1 of Project 3 in  collaboration with Merrimack Pharma. The hypothesis for the basis of synergistic mechanisms is that MM-398  reduces hypoxia and enhances PDT, while PDT destroys ABCG2 transporters and enhances MM-398  retention. Since single therapies alone are ineffective in PanCa, it is hypothesized that this combination  strategy will enhance survival of patients who have locally advanced and/or metastatic disease. In AIM 3 we  will study the efficacy of EUS-PDT in the treatment of premalignant cystic tumors of the pancreas. We will  establish the use of fluorescence dosimetry and pre-PDT contrast CT to maximize PDT-induced cyst ablation.  The immediate impact of this project will be to improve the care of patients with PanCa, and more broadly the  findings will establish a clinical framework to translate new nanomedicine and combination-based targeted  therapeutic discoveries for cancer.  Potential public health benefits: The clinical studies described in Aims 1 and 2 provide new minimally  invasive treatment options aimed at improving the length and quality of life in patients with PanCa. In Aim 3, we  will develop a new ablative treatment option for patients with pancreatic cystic tumors, which will reduce the  inconvenience and anxiety for patients of serial imaging and need for long-term follow up or surgery, with  significant cost-savings."
"9488099","Summary Leishmania braziliensis infection may cause a high spectrum of clinical manifestation, including the more prevalent form, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Inflammatory response is a hallmark of CL and high levels of TNF, presence of CD8+ T cells and mononuclear phagocytes are associated with skin ulcer development in these individuals. In our endemic area we have been able to identify individuals with a non-ulcerated lesion (papule), with regional lymphadenopathy and positive Leishmania skin test. These individuals report less than 15 days of disease evolution and are considered to have early CL (ECL). Our preliminary data shows that ECL patients have more parasites than CL ones and are able to mount inflammatory response to Leishmania antigen in in-vitro assays. A major problem in areas of L. braziliensis transmission regards therapeutic failure. Studies from our group and others show that up to 30% of CL (with ulcerated lesion) patients fail treatment with pentavalent antimony, drug of choice of Brazilian Minister of Health to treat leishmaniasis. The early treatment of the majority of infectious disease benefits the patients, decreasing time to cure and relapses. However, we have been reporting that in ECL the therapeutic failure is up to 70%. Interestingly, our preliminary data show genetic differences between most parasites isolated from ECL and those from CL. Our main hypothesis is that high rates of therapeutic failure in ECL is associated with drug resistance and lack of regulation of inflammatory due to high amounts of Leishmania, thus contributing to ulcer development. To investigate the mechanisms associated with therapeutic failure we will establish a cohort of ECL and CL individuals admitted in the health post of our endemic area. In the Aim 1 of the present proposal we intend to assess parasite genetic polymorphism and resistance to leishmanicidal drugs, and quantify host and Leishmania genes associated with therapeutic failure. In Aim 2 we will investigate immune mechanisms involved of therapeutic failure. For that we will determine the contribution of cells, soluble factors, cell receptors and regulatory mechanisms in ECL and CL before and during therapy. In Aim 3 we will study the ability of eicosanoids metabolites of Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA, EPA and Resolvins) to regulate inflammatory response in ECL and CL. The early identification of individuals that will fail treatment will allow the early use of another choice of therapy."

"9444463","Project 1 Summary Using the rhesus macaque (RM) model, we have repeatedly demonstrated that the SIV-specific immune responses elicited by strain 68-1 (Rh157.5/Rh157.4-deleted) RhCMV/SIV vectors (which are characterized by high frequency, broadly distributed, effector-memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses) result in immediate control and ultimate clearance of mucosally-administered, highly pathogenic SIVmac239 virus in 50-60% of vaccinated RM. Although the pattern of the ?arrest and clear? protection observed in these 68-1 RhCMV/SIV vector-vaccinated RM suggests that the early pathogen intercept afforded by the vaccine-elicited ?in place? effector-memory T cells plays a critical role in efficacy, recent data indicates that this unique response characteristic is not, by itself, sufficient for protection. Indeed, we have shown that the CD8+ T cells elicited by the strain 68-1 RhCMV/SIV vectors manifest another very unusual immunologic property: all of these CD8+ T cells were found to recognize epitopes that were restricted by either MHC-II or MHC-E, not conventional MHC- Ia. We further demonstrated that this unconventional epitope targeting was reverted to conventional MHC-Ia restriction by repair of Rh157.5/Rh157.4 expression, which did not otherwise affect the functional or phenotypic characteristics of vector-elicited CD8+ T cells. Remarkably, in 2 independent studies, the Rh157.5/Rh157.4- repaired RhCMV/SIV vectors failed to protect vaccinated RM against SIV challenge, demonstrating that unconventional CD8+ T cell epitope recognition is required for RhCMV/SIV vector efficacy. Recent work has demonstrated that conventional vs. unconventional CD8+ T cell priming is regulated by multiple RhCMV genes, the modification of which effectively programs RhCMV vectors to elicit CD8+ T cell responses with distinct epitope recognition patterns. Based on these data, Projects 2-4 of this program will design and construct RhCMV and HCMV vectors that are strategically modified to both unravel the virologic mechanisms that mediate this CD8+ T cell epitope recognition ?programming?, and to develop vectors that predominantly or exclusively elicit MHC-II- vs. MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses. Project 1 will be responsible for determining the epitope recognition profile of the CD8+ T cells elicited by each of these modified vectors in RM, and for selecting RhCMV/SIV vectors that differentially elicit MHC-II- vs. MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses for efficacy testing. Project 1 will then determine the contribution of these response type(s) to efficacy and whether focusing the response on a particular response type improves efficacy, and will also define immunologic correlates of this protection. The insight gained from these studies will be used by Projects 4 and 5 to design, manufacture and clinically test a ?safety- and CD8+ T cell response-optimized? HCMV/HIV vector, and Project 1 will efficacy test the RhCMV/SIV homolog of this clinical vector in RM, using heterologous SIV challenge, to confirm efficacy and immune correlates, as well as determine the kinetics of CMV/SIV vector- mediated protection after vaccination and the dependence of efficacy on boosting and vector dose.  "
"9453002","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a five-year training program for the development of a career in clinical research, focused on improving the quality of cardiac catheterization in children. This proposal is will serve as a vehicle to developing into an independent investigator. To that end, we have established a training plan that includes mentoring, course-work, didactic educational activities, and hands-on research. Steven Kawut, MD, MS, (the primary mentor) is a tenured Associate Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology. He has a track record of successfully mentoring fellows and junior faculty and holds a K24 to support his mentoring activities. An advisory committee has been assembled to guide the candidate's career development.  The application focuses on three specific aims. First, metrics to compare the outcomes of catheterization laboratories in different centers have not been defined. We have demonstrated that death and other catastrophic outcomes are significantly associated with procedural volume. However, the association between procedural volume and less severe adverse events was much less strong. We propose to study the association between procedural volume and risk of failure to rescue (i.e., the ability to avoid catastrophic outcome given an adverse event), and in so doing introduce it to as a novel outcome measure in the field. We propose to leverage a multi-center clinical registry, the IMproving Pediatric and Adult Treatment (IMPACT) registry to accomplish this aim.  Second, economic cost is not only a surrogate marker of clinical outcome, but also an independent measure of the efficiency of healthcare delivery. We propose to establish benchmarks for the economic cost of catheterization procedures, and to study the factors influencing cost. To accomplish this aim, we will use a multi-center administrative database, the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database.  Third, patient-reported outcomes, such as health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) represent an important aspect of health that is not captured in traditional physician reported outcomes (and moreover are not included in multicenter registries and databases). They also represent an important aspect (along with cost) of comparative effectiveness research. We propose to perform a single center cohort study of children undergoing catheterization to define the effect of cardiac catheterization on HR-QOL, and to determine the factors (modifiable and non-modifiable) that influence it.  Together, these three aims illuminate different outcomes associated with cardiac catheterization in children. By combining these novel techniques, the applicant hopes to begin to define the factors that influence health and well-being of children undergoing catheterization and set the groundwork for studies that will test interventions to improve the quality of care for children requiring cardiac catheterization."
"9540993","Project Summary One of the primary ways in which infants learn about the world is through their own actions and interactions with other people, particularly parents and caretakers. This project proposal focuses on the cognitive skills that underlie successful parent-child interactions in profoundly deaf infants who receive cochlear implants. Cochlear implantation is currently the leading intervention for infants with profound hearing loss. Cochlear implants (CIs) provide access to sound for deaf populations, enabling spoken language acquisition and the social development that accompanies it. However, not all infants who receive CIs achieve age-appropriate language outcomes. Further, there is an enormous degree of variability in their outcomes, which extends to general cognitive functioning. So far, research aimed at identifying sources of this variability has focused on audiological and demographic factors, but has largely ignored the underlying cognitive factors that guide their learning mechanisms and social interactions. The proposed research will address this gap by investigating action prediction?the ability to visually anticipate goal-directed actions?and joint coordination abilities during parent-child interactions. Action prediction is a nonverbal cognitive skill forms the basis for social-cognitive development but has never been examined deaf infants. This project will use innovative, head-mounted eye- tracking methodology to determine how early deafness affects action and interaction skills in deaf infants (implanted before 18 months of age) and a comparison group of normal-hearing, age-matched controls. We will next examine links between these skills and their receptive and expressive language growth. Deaf infants will be assessed longitudinally before and after cochlear implantation to identify how their action skills change following implantation, and how they compare with the development of hearing infants. Finally, we will relate the outcomes of these experiments to standardized measures of expressive and receptive language, in order to better understand the pathways through which deafness influences language outcomes in CI users. This research will provide important new information for parents and clinicians that will aid in identifying new targets for therapy in order to maximize learning opportunities and successful social interactions for these infants. It will also shed light on the challenges that deaf infants face during parent-child interactions, which can be then used to inform intervention strategies that form part of the clinical care for deaf infants post-implantation. Further, this research will contribute new knowledge about the role of early auditory experiences in cognitive and social development which will be of general relevance to the field of developmental research."
"9585287","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mathematical sciences including engineering, statistics, computer science, physics, econometrics, psychometrics, epidemiology, and mathematics qua mathematics are increasingly being applied to advance our understanding of the causes, consequences, and alleviation of obesity. These applications do not merely involve routine well-established approaches easily implemented in widely available commercial software. Rather, they increasingly involve computationally demanding tasks, use and in some cases development of novel analytic methods and software, new derivations, computer simulations, and unprecedented interdigitation of two or more existing techniques. Such advances at the interface of the mathematical sciences and obesity research require bilateral training and exposure for investigators in both disciplines. Yet, no ongoing resource exists to provide such training and role models of scientists who regularly can and do traverse these disciplines are in short supply at most institutions. The proposed annual five day short course on the mathematical sciences in obesity research features some of the world's finest scientists working in this domain to fill this unmet need by providing nine topic driven modules designed to bridge the disciplines. Each module will begin with a mathematical method applied in obesity research. This introduction will be followed by a lecture on a completed application of the method. Directly after the completed application, participants will be engaged in a guided interactive session performing calculations using software or analysis pertaining to the module topic. Finally, the module closes with a lecture on remaining open questions. In recognition of the challenges in successfully managing an interdisciplinary career, each day of the short course will contain a two hour long interactive working session guided by established senior researchers in building the next step. Participants may choose to use this interactive session to begin develop an abstract for submission at national level obesity conferences or plan an application for a small interdisciplinary group of researchers to advance their ideas at the National Institute of Mathematical and Biological Synthesis in Knoxville, TN. Based on the degree of completion, ten participants will be selected to present their work on the last day of the short course. The NIH and the scientific community at large has voiced the need for more training at the interface of the mathematical science and key biomedical domains, and we request the opportunity to be part of the solution."
"9467885","Cerebellar damage impairs movement coordination and adaptive motor learning abilities, making actions like reaching inaccurate and very difficult to control. There are currently no medications that systematically improve cerebellar movement incoordination or `ataxia', making rehabilitation therapy the main treatment option. Yet, people with ataxia are notoriously difficult to treat with physical therapy, likely due to the fact that they are limited in their ability to learn new movement patterns. The studies proposed here address this challenge through the development of a staged, individualized approach to understanding if distinct interventions will be helpful to different people. We will use mathematical modeling of patient-specific movement deficits, alternative learning mechanisms, and robotic control of reaching to test whether we can systematically reduce arm ataxia. In Aim 1, we will determine if reinforcement based motor learning can be used as an alternative strategy in people with cerebellar damage. Our preliminary data show that reinforcement based motor learning is much more effective than adaptive motor learning for reaching movements in people with ataxia. We will test whether this can be used to change complex elements of 3D reaching that are more clinically meaningful for people with ataxia. In Aim 2, we will test whether long-term reinforcement-based training can reduce ataxia and improve 3D reaching performance. Here we will test whether people who show learning via reinforcement on a single day in Aim 1. We will determine if they benefit more from a 2-week course of virtual reality-based reinforcement reach training compared to 2 weeks of standard reaching practice. We will study how training transfers to natural reaching movements (i.e. those outside of the virtual reality environment) and clinical rating scales of arm ataxia and function. In Aim 3, we will develop compensatory robotic assistance for people with ataxia based on individualized models of cerebellar function. This is essential for individuals with the most severe ataxia and learning problems who do not learn at all in Aim 1. In sum, this proposal provides a scientific framework for determining an individual's motor learning potential for rehabilitation versus the need for intelligent compensatory robotic assistance. Our overarching goal is to provide a foundation for devising and choosing new rehabilitation strategies."
"9453724","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension (HTN) is a multifactorial disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. While many risk factors for HTN have been identified, they do not adequately predict whether an individual will develop this disease. The overarching goal of this proposal is to expand understanding on possible modifiable factors and their underlying mechanism for HTN in older women. Investigators propose to examine the association between periodontal disease (PD), edentulism (the complete lack of teeth), the oral microbiome, inflammatory profile, and incident HTN in postmenopausal women. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that edentulism and PD may be associated with HTN; however there are no prospective epidemiologic studies that have evaluated this association in postmenopausal women. It is important to study this association in postmenopausal women be- cause HTN, edentulism, and PD are common in this demographic. Aim 1 will assess the prospective association between PD and incident HTN in 46,400 women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS). A potential mechanism of the association between PD and HTN is inflammation caused by harmful oral microbes. Inflammation has been shown to play a critical role in HTN in animal models. Also, certain cytokines have been independently associated with HTN in epidemiologic studies. Better understanding of the influence inflammation has on HTN could be realized through studies of broader cytokine profiles. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the association between inflammatory biomarkers and HTN utilizing data from 893 women enrolled in the Buffalo Osteoporosis and Periodontal Disease (OsteoPerio) observational cohort study, an ancillary study of the WHI-OS. Another important factor in PD is imbalances in the oral microbiome, which may contribute to the inflammatory link between PD and HTN. The association between composition of the oral microbiome and HTN has not been investigated. Aim 3 will assess associations between composition of the oral microbiome and hypertension in the OsteoPerio study. All three aims will be achieved utilizing prospective data and biological samples available in the WHI-OS and OsteoPerio. Aims 2 and 3 will additionally utilize data currently being collected at a 15 year follow-up visit. Overall this grant application proposes to determine whether (1) edentulism and PD, (2) inflammatory biomarkers, and (3) composition of the subgingival microbiome at baseline are associated with increased risk of HTN during follow-up. Achieving these aims will deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of HTN in older adults in whom HTN exacts enormous health and economic burden. Results could also inform future mechanistic evaluations of HTN, as well as identification of novel intervention targets to enhance population control of HTN and its complications."
"9406119","Dystonias are a group of devastating neurological movement disorders characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that can affect any body region. There is no cure or effective treatment as the pathophysiology of the disorder remains largely unknown. In focal dystonia, symptoms are restricted to one specific body part. Dystonia affecting the hand is called focal hand dystonia (FHD), whereas when the vocal chords are affected it is termed adductor spasmodic dysphonia (AdSD). Despite different clinical manifestations (impaired voice or use of hand), both are thought to share a common underlying mechanism. But commonalities in pathophysiology of focal dystonias have not been well explored. Our central hypothesis is that focal dystonia is a brain network disorder with desynchronized connectivity (?dysconnectivity?), or ineffective collaboration between brain areas within the network associated with the dystonic task during either resting state, active state or both. This hypothesis can be tested with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) seeds that represent different but related parts of the voluntary motor network. Therefore, using each seed for a functional connectivity (fc) assessment elucidates more precisely the nature of the dysconnectivity. We will determine the fc during resting state (resting state fc) and active state (task fc) between the loci and through the whole brain. Aim 1 will determine the individual fc of fMRI and TMS loci for the vocalization and hand motor networks in CTL and dystonia. Sub Aim 1.1 will determine if the individual fc between fMRI and TMS loci differs between CTL and dystonia and if this difference is state dependent, meaning the fc differs between resting (resting state fc) and active (task fc); Sub Aim 1.2 will determine if the individual whole brain fc map differs between CTL and dystonia and if this difference is related to a certain loci or state; Sub Aim 1.3 will determine if fc analyzed in standard space reveal differences between CTL and dystonia and if this difference is state dependent. Aim 2 will determine the relationship between disease severity and brain behavioral findings. Relevance: The pathophysiology of focal dystonia is unknown. Recent advances in neuroimaging and brain stimulation made by this team will allow multimodal assessments of anatomical and voluntary brain networks that will provide a novel window into the pathophysiology of both FHD and AdSD individually, as well as determine unifying features in both disorders. These findings will leave us well positioned to develop common treatment strategies in all focal dystonias based upon specific physiologic underpinnings. Further, the unique nature of this focal brain-based disease also has implications for our understanding of general brain function. Understanding how brain networks interact and form faulty associations could have wide reaching implications for many other disorders."

"9378373","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      ABSTRACT Osteoporosis is a common skeletal degenerative disorder that is characterized by decrease of bone-mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue. It results from increased osteoclast (OC)-mediated bone resorption and/or reduced osteoblast (OB)-mediated bone formation. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive dementia. Intriguingly, AD patients frequently have lower bone mineral density and higher rate of hip fracture, compared with the same age normal population. Several newly identified AD risk genes/loci encode proteins critical for osteoclastic activation and/or bone-mass homeostasis. Increasing evidence from clinical and genetic studies thus supports a degree of association of both disorders. However, very few studies are available to address the underlying mechanisms.  The goal of this proposal is to determine if and how the Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) acts as a risk factor for osteoporosis. APP is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein. Its cleavage product, A?, is believed to be a major culprit for both early- and late-onset AD. We thus explored the possible contribution of APPswe to AD- associated skeletal deficits in mice. Tg2576 mice express APPswe under the control of prion promoter, and develop AD-relevant neuro-pathologic deficits at older age (>10 months old). Remarkably, our preliminary studies revealed age-dependent osteoporotic deficits in this AD animal model, including reduced trabecular bone-mass in young adult age and deteriorated bone tissue at older age. The reduced bone-mass was associated with a decrease in osteoblastic bone formation and an increase in osteoclastic bone resorption. The deteriorated bone structure was preceded by an impaired osteoclastic bone resorption. To investigate underlying mechanisms, we generated a transgenic mouse that enables cell-type specific expression of APPswe in OBs and OCs. Our results suggest that APPswe plays a cell autonomous role in suppressing OB-mediated bone formation and in regulating OC activation. These results uncovered potentially novel cellular mechanisms by which APPswe disrupts bone homeostasis. However, underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this proposal, we will address this issue.  This research will not only provide a potential link between AD and skeletal deficits, but also identify unrecognized functions of APP and APPswe, and reveal new pathophysiological mechanisms underlying osteoporosis and AD, both chronic degenerative disorders affecting many veteran's quality of life and highly relevant to Strategic Objectives of VA."
"9442817","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to test adaptations of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) designed to increase the likelihood of widespread use in workplace settings. CDSMP, which has been proven efficacious in community trials, is a six-week program that is designed to help individuals better manage their chronic disease and its many complications. Although there is considerable interest among worksite health promotion practitioners for a chronic disease program, CDSMP has not been adapted and tested in workplace settings. In this study, we will determine a) if the CDSMP program tailored to worksites can be efficacious, b) the comparative effectiveness of the worksite tailored CDSMP when compared to the original CDSMP and c) the cost-effectiveness (average and incremental) and return on investment of the two interventions. The participating sites are seven organizations from a rural county in Southwest Georgia. Our partner for the project is the local YMCA. YMCA staff will be trained to implement the program which will foster sustainability. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1) workplace-tailored CDSMP, 2) 'usual care' CDSMP, and 3) control group. Data will collect at baseline, 6-month follow-up and 12-months follow-up. The control group will be a delayed intervention group that will be randomly assigned to an intervention group after taking the 6 month survey. The primary outcome measures include blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose, BMI, diet, physical activity and tobacco use and the secondary measures including patient-provider communication, quality of life, medical adherence, and work performance and productivity. An average cost-effectiveness analysis will compare interventions to control and an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted comparing each intervention to one another. The hypotheses will be tested using a growth modeling approach examining changes over time. This will enable us to maximize the dissemination and implementation of CDSMP across worksite populations by using approaches which are realistic for most work organizations."

"9459211","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It has been estimated that approximately 20% of U.S. service members returning from the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have suffered at least one head injury during deployment. Nearly 83% of these injuries can be classified as mild and are the direct result of either blunt-force (i.e., direct blow to the head) or blast-related (i.e., high pressure from an improvised explosive device) trauma. Though the short and long-term consequences of neurotrauma are now only beginning to be appreciated, those with history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) show increased rates of disability and psychiatric disorders, decreased quality of life, significant cognitive deficits, and troublesome experience of post-concussive symptoms (PCS), relative to those with no history of mTBI. Though vastly understudied, the role of the cerebrovascular dysfunction in outcomes after mTBI has recently begun to garner increasing attention. Importantly, the brain is reliant on steady cerebral blood flow (CBF) to carry out a host of functional processes and maintain neuronal integrity. Brief fluctuations and/or prolonged alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) have been linked to negative pathological consequences (e.g., neurodegeneration, ischemia) and cognitive dysfunction. Within the context of mTBI, biomechanical and animal models suggest that primary structural alterations to vasculature or brain parenchyma supplied by microvasculature coupled with secondary cellular and/or molecular initiated neuroinflammatory cascades could greatly alter CBF post-injury. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand and clarify the nature of CBF alterations and its potential contributions to negative health outcomes in mTBI, particularly in chronic stages. The current proposal therefore seeks to use state-of-the art, non-invasive, multi-phase pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (MPPCASL) neuroimaging methods to:  (1) evaluate whether CBF changes occur in those with history of mTBI; (2) investigate the relationship between resting CBF and neuropsychological function; and (3) in exploratory analyses, examine possible mediators and/or moderators of resting CBF and cognition in those with history of mTBI. Importantly, understanding the nature and underlying contribution of CBF to poor outcomes in those with mTBI will help inform prevention and interventional strategies that are currently being developed to mitigate negative health consequences for those who have sustained head trauma. Specifically, information gleaned from this proposal has the potential to improve diagnosis, aid in symptom management, and possibly provide a useful biomarker of both impairment and recovery in a vulnerable population where persistent neurological and behavioral dysfunction remains poorly understood.  "
"9653306","Transcriptional enhancers control the spatiotemporal specificity of gene expression during embryonic development. It is estimated that the human genome contains hundreds of thousands of enhancers, making their identification and understanding of function important to understanding human development and disease. Advances in whole genome analysis of chromatin states have driven significant progress in the ability to identify potential cis-regulatory elements, but the ability to elucidate biological function and determine how changes in gene regulation lead to phenotypic innovation remains challenging and represents a fundamental gap in the understanding of gene regulation and enhancer evolution. One specific innovation of interest is the vertebrate brain and the genomic changes that led to this morphological novelty. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the evolutionary origins of the cis-regulatory logic underlying the vertebrate central nervous system using the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii, an invertebrate deuterostome that lacks a CNS. The overall objective here is to identify the conserved enhancer elements active in the primary vertebrate brain signaling centers and determine their regulatory function in S. kowalevskii and mouse. Preliminary data indicate a functional ortholog of mouse Sonic hedgehog brain enhancer 1 (SBE1) active in the zona limitans intrathalamica exists in S. kowalevskii and the cis and trans determinants underlying Shh expression are of ancient origin. These data suggest the same SBE1 enhancer is used to regulate Shh expression in diverse, nonhomologous structures in vertebrates and hemichordates, and show the feasibility of identifying functional conserved enhancers in animals with disparate anatomies separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolution. The central hypothesis is despite strong morphological disparity the cis-regulatory elements active in the vertebrate anterior neural ridge, zona limitans intrathalamica, and isthmic organizer are present in the hemichordate S. kowalevskii, an animal with a diffuse nerve net, and have a conserved regulatory function. The rationale for this proposed research is to gain insight not only into the origins of the vertebrate CNS enhancers, but also the fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation and its link to morphological innovation. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify the conserved cis-regulatory elements active in the primary vertebrate signaling centers using ATAC-seq and transposon-mediated enhancer trapping of S. kowalevskii BACs in mouse; 2) Determine the spatiotemporal activity of hemichordate and mouse enhancers in transgenic S. kowalevskii and mouse embryos; and 3) Elucidate the function of each conserved cis-regulatory element in S. kowalevskii using CRISRP-Cas9 genome editing tools. The approach is innovative because it is one of the first to identify the presence of key conserved functionally validated developmental enhancers with roles in patterning disparate morphological structures. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand our understanding of gene regulation and its link to morphological innovation."
"9467135","Project Summary/Abstract Children with speech sound disorder show diminished accuracy and intelligibility in spoken communication and may thus be perceived as less capable or intelligent than peers, even when they are of average or above-average intellectual ability. While most speech errors resolve by the late school-age years, up to 1-2% of individuals will continue to exhibit residual speech errors (RSE) throughout the lifespan [1]. These errors can limit participation in academic and social settings, with negative consequences for both socioemotional wellness and socioeconomic outcomes [2, 3, 4]. RSE is known to be particularly challenging to treat, with the result that speech-language pathologists (SLPs) often discharge these clients with their errors uncorrected. Both affected children/families and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) have highlighted the critical need for research to identify and disseminate more effective forms of treatment for children with RSE.  New technologies have the potential to revolutionize both the development and delivery of interventions for speech disorders, but this possibility has seen very little systematic investigation to date. Previous lab-based research, including work by the PI [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], has documented the ef?cacy of speech treatment incorporating visual-acoustic biofeedback, in which a client views a computer-generated image of the acoustic signal of his/her speech and attempts to match a model representing correct production. However, translation of this research to clinical practice is limited at present by the cost of the technology. At the same time, there is a need for well-powered group studies to strengthen the evidence base supporting the ef?cacy of biofeedback, but large- scale speech treatment research is prohibitively expensive under current models. The long-term goal of this project is to address these clinical and research needs simultaneously. We propose to develop a ?exible mobile application that will make an evidence-based biofeedback treatment program widely available to clinicians and pa- tients/parents, and will also enable large-scale tests of hypotheses about intervention ef?cacy through distributed delivery of treatment following standardized protocols. We anticipate that by increasing access to biofeedback intervention while also strengthening the evidence base in support of this method, this project will greatly expand the number of clinicians adopting biofeedback and thus multiply the public health impact of this important line of clinical research."

The goal of The Ohio State University DISCOVERY PREP is to strengthen all three of these elements in our postbaccalaureate scholars and to develop the belief in them that they will become skilled biomedical scientists who possess a sense of control over their environment, as well as the behavior needed to handle the challenging demands of graduate school. This is a competitive renewal application for years five through eight of a training program that will support seven postbaccalaureate scholars from underrepresented backgrounds pursuing entrance into a competitive graduate program in the biomedical sciences. Twenty-eight faculty members, one Associate Director of Career Counseling, and two resource staff provide not only intensive laboratory research training, but also relevant professional development guidance. The faculty research expertise is diverse, and is complemented by successful funding, publications, and training of Ph.D. students, some of whom have been from underrepresented backgrounds. The career-counseling component of the Program is excellent and contributes much toward enhancing resiliency and self-efficacy. During the four years of initial funding, the DISCOVERY PREP supported 17 scholars, which included an additional trainee added with cost-sharing support from the College of Medicine. All 17 scholars enrolled in a graduate program, of which eleven enrolled in a Ph.D., one in an M.S. program, two applied in 2014 for a 2015 enrollment, and two chose other forms of work in science. This yielded an enrollment success rate of 72%, excluding the Masters student, which will increase to 82% when the two late applicants are enrolled in 2015. Most of our scholars have gone on to pursue their graduate degree in programs throughout the US, with 30% remaining at The Ohio State University. Our scholars have been productive in publishing, and some graduates have already received fellowships and awards from their respective graduate universities, the NSF, or national organizations. We continue to revise and optimize our Program to meet the needs of our scholars so that they will become the diverse scientific workforce of the future, as well as diverse scientific leaders of the future. The renewal of this grant is critical to support our continuing efforts to promote research training, resiliency, and self-efficacy in postbaccalaureate scholars from underrepresented backgrounds so that they believe in their capabilities to become a scientific leader of tomorrow."
"9487054","Project Summary/Abstract Accurate perception of others' emotion is critical for successful social interaction, yet it diminishes over the lifespan and is impaired across a wide range of disorders, including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, autism, and schizophrenia. The current proposal builds on a computational model developed by the PI, which posits that perceptions of social categories, including emotion categories, are driven not only by bottom-up cues inherent to targets (e.g., facial features) but also top-down factors harbored within perceivers, such as context and expectations. Although recent studies have documented the impact of such top-down factors in emotion perception, the mechanisms underlying these top-down impacts and how ?deeply? they manifest at lower levels of visual representation is far less clear. The overarching goal of this proposal is to use cutting- edge neuroimaging and behavioral methods to understand basic mechanisms of facial emotion perception, and particularly the impact by expectations and context. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used in conjunction with an innovative behavioral technique developed by the PI to accomplish 3 specific aims: (a) examine how context and expectations systematically bias the visual representation of a face's emotion, which is driven by OFC?FG interplay and depends on IFOF integrity; (b) test whether this top-down modulation is automatic and does not reflect some form of post-perceptual response bias; and (c) this mechanism this mechanism is shaped by inter-individual variability in emotion-conceptual knowledge, which provides a set of top-down expectations on the perception of facial emotion. The results will have numerous implications for the understanding of flexible emotion perception at the behavioral and neural levels, and will also help inform a variety of clinical processes involving the impairment of emotion perception and social dysfunction."
"9644190","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To investigate how cytoplasmic dynein orients the mitotic spindle, we are using the budding yeast S. cerevisiae as a model cell system. This system offers facile genetics, ease of protein manipulation, and a simple astral microtubule organization enabling the dissection of dynein regulation during asymmetric cell divisions, which provides physiological relevance to human stem cell biology, development, and cancer.  In previous studies, we found that dynein is targeted to the dynamic astral microtubule plus ends and is delivered via tip-tracking to its cortical anchoring protein, Num1. At the cortex, dynein uses its minus end-directed motor activity to pull an astral microtubule and the connected spindle toward the site of dynein anchorage. We discovered the critical domain in Num1 responsible for dynein interaction and function, and found She1 as a potent inhibitor of dynein motility along the astral microtubules. We will investigate how these cortical and microtubule-associated components mediate spatial and temporal regulation of dynein activity, thereby ensuring directional spindle movement into the yeast bud cell. Aim 1. Identify the mechanism responsible for dynein inhibition along astral microtubules. To dissect the molecular basis of She1-mediated dynein regulation, we will determine how She1 interacts with dynein and analyze the subcellular localization of She1, testing the hypothesis that it is asymmetrically targeted to different areas of the cell to restrict dynein activity. We will search for specific Sh1 binding partners, investigate the functional roles of these proteins, and test the significance of their interactions with She1. Aim 2. Determine the effect of dynein-cortex interaction on dynein motility. We hypothesize that cortical Num1 enhances dynein motility enabling dynein-dynactin to pull the mitotic spindle into the narrow bud neck. Using multiple approaches encompassing biochemistry, genetics, and in vitro single-molecule motility assays, we will dissect the molecular basis underlying the interaction between dynein, dynactin, and Num1. We will investigate the potential roles of Num1 in triggering dynein offloading or stimulating dynein minus end-directed motility."
"9483347","PROJECT SUMMARY Family psychoeducation for adults with psychotic disorders in Tanzania Global health officials have called for treatment of psychotic disorders to be prioritized in low- and middle- income countries where they have been severely neglected. A major obstacle to care for those living with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia globally is an absence of evidence-based practices appropriate for cultural contexts where resources are scarce, families are fundamental for treatment, and where many affected individuals and their families hold traditional (i.e. non-biomedical) ideas about the cause of psychosis and seek treatment from traditional practitioners. Family psychoeducation (FPE) is an evidence-based practice used in high-income countries to help individuals with psychotic disorders and their relatives to cope more effectively with the illness; however, FPE has never been tested in a low-resource country nor have the mechanisms of action for this psychosocial intervention been fully identified in any context. This project posits that FPE has great potential for improving the reach, quality, and effectiveness of mental health services for those with psychotic disorders in Tanzania and other similar contexts worldwide?namely, by using family members as co-facilitators for the intervention and by explicitly addressing the traditional beliefs and practices of affected individuals and their caregivers. The goal of this R34 proposal (RFA-MH-16-410) is to pilot test a tailored Family Psychoeducation model (FamPE) for adults with psychotic disorders and their relatives that is appropriate for cultural settings inclusive of both traditional and biomedical ideas about mental illness and that incorporates relatives as co-facilitators of the intervention. We will utilize formative research [70 qualitative interviews], an expert review panel, and a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) [72 patient/relative dyads] to meet these specific aims: 1) Assess how family psychoeducation can improve client outcomes, engage families and address gaps in mental health services in Tanzania from various stakeholder perspectives; 2) Develop the FamPE intervention for use in Tanzania by building upon and tailoring the SAMHSA Family Psychoeducation Evidence-Based Practice Kit; 3) Elucidate the mechanisms of action and refine the mediation and study outcome measures for the future R01; and 4) Pilot test the FamPE intervention to a) assess the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted FPE intervention for 12 weeks, and b) explore its impact on patient relapse, quality of life and disability. This pilot effectiveness trial of FamPE will adequately prepare us for a subsequent R01 submission for a fully powered RCT of FamPE against the standard of care in Tanzania. This project supports NIMH's strategic priority of effectiveness research on therapeutic interventions with previously demonstrated efficacy for use with broader target populations and it also supports NIMH's priority for clinical trials to explicitly address whether the intervention engages the hypothesized mechanisms of action."
"9440359","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clear cell renal cell carcinoma, the most common subtype of kidney cancer, is characterized by mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers. One of these genes, SETD2, encodes the only methyltransferase capable of trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3). In patients, mutation of SETD2 has been associated with decreased overall survival and time to recurrence. Previous work has shown that mutation of SETD2 in human tumors is associated with altered chromatin accessibility and wide-spread RNA processing defects. Common mutations in SETD2 include early frameshift/nonsense mutations, mutations in the catalytic SET domain and mutations in the SRI domain, which mediates the interaction between SETD2 and RNA polymerase. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that SETD2 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating chromatin during transcription, and that disruption of this process promotes cancer through both transcriptional processing defects and widespread reorganization of chromatin packaging. Aim 1 will identify the effect of specific SETD2 mutations in the SET and SRI domains on cellular transformation and RNA processing. Cell lines have been engineered for SETD2 inactivation and expression of tumor-associated SETD2 mutants in the SET domain and SRI domain. These cells will be used to study proliferation, anchorage independent growth, and cell migration. These cells will also be examined for altered RNA processing, including aberrant splicing, altered exon utilization, and alternate transcription start/termination sites, using RNA-seq data and published and custom generated computational algorithms. Aim 2 will examine the effect of SETD2 mutation on H3K36me3 placement as well as overall chromatin organization. H3K36me3 localization will be examined by ChIP-seq in cell harboring SRI domain mutants. Cells will be tested for changes in chromatin organization by FAIRE-seq and MNAse-seq. RNA, ChIP, chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning data will then be integrated to explore the role of SETD2 and its effect on chromatin organization. Results from this study will further our understanding of the ability of SETD2 to suppress tumor development by maintaining epigenomic organization and transcriptomic fidelity."
"9475073","In many solid malignancies, molecular and cellular heterogeneity within a single tumor confounds our ability to understand tumorigenesis and to design effective therapies. Much effort has focused on genetic variants, the forces that lead to clonal outgrowth, and the relevance these clones have to the development of drug resistance. However it is the highly dynamic forms of non-genetic heterogeneity that are thought to enable adaptation to the rapidly changing stresses that confront the tumor as it grows and wounds the surrounding environment. Little is understood about non-genetic heterogeneity, whether it reflects a random epiphenomenon or mutualistic cooperation among cancer cells to benefit the tumor as a whole. Here we address these questions using a systems biology approach to mathematically model a pattern of non-genetic heterogeneity in xenografted colon tumors. Our studies of Wnt-?-signaling and its regulation of glycolysis have led us to discover a striking quasi-regular array of cell clusters (spots). Cells clusters are identified by high levels of Wnt (?-catenin and its target LEF1) and we identify a similar spotted pattern using markers of glycolysis. Manipulation of the levels of Wnt signaling in these xenografts changes the spotted pattern and reduces tumor growth. Whether the growth defect is functionally linked to the changes in pattern and heterogeneity is a fundamental unknown we wish to address. The overarching goal of this project therefore is to identify molecules and strategies that create pattern in this system, to ask how these strategies influence tumor growth, and to determine whether these mechanisms are involved in drug resistance. Aim 1 will use high-resolution single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and tumor imaging to build on our existing mathematical model and to explain the relationships between tumor heterogeneity, growth and invasion. Data from experiments wherein expression of candidate regulators and cell populations have been manipulated will be used to validate and refine the predictive power of our model. Work in Aim 2 will build a general model(s) that can explain how overt differences in tumor growth, heterogeneity, and metabolism arise as emergent behaviors of non-linearly interacting networks that qualitatively and quantitatively affect the Wnt pathway. In Aim 3 we use xenograft models that develop resistance to the anti-angiogenic drug bevacizumab and single cell RNA-seq approaches to examine the changes in cellular heterogeneity and patterning that accompany acquisition of resistance. Mathematical modeling will identify the most likely resistance mechanisms: mutualistic metabolic symbiosis, metabolic/population rewiring, mutualistic non-metabolic symbiosis, or none of the above. Modeling predictions of strategies that re-establish drug sensitivity will be tested via genetic engineering (CRISPR/Cas9) or small molecule drug therapies."
"9563050","We propose to strengthen and sustain our international Research Training Program shared between The Ohio State University and Institutes of Higher Learning in East Africa. Expanding the successes in the first cycle, the long-term goal of this program is to establish sustainable research and training capacity for zoonotic infectious diseases research in eastern Africa. The specific mission of the proposed program is to train the future researchers and trainers using an integrated multi-disciplinary One Health approach. The ultimate goal is to establish sustainable critical mass of capable scientists that can effectively conduct research on zoonotic diseases and implement prevention and control systems. The main targets of the proposed program are four eastern African academic institutes (University of Gondar and Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia? University of Nairobi, Kenya and Sokoine University, Tanzania). Food-, water-, and vector-borne infectious diseases such as invasive salmonellosis, animal-borne tuberculosis, viral food/waterborne pathogen and vector-borne diseases are major global public health concerns with a high morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the research training capacities in the region remain extremely weak. In the current cycle, we made key transformations to increase the success of our program including: 1) revamped priorities including water-borne and vector-borne diseases such; 2) refined discipline areas are now more targeted and measureable such as rapid diagnostic development, antimicrobial resistance and genomics; 3) integrated electronic and digital approaches for research and training to maximize the impact of our program and 4) emphasized scientific leadership and implementation science, to maximize impact and sustain results. This research training program will be conducted using two Tracks: Track 1 is a sandwich format pre­-doctoral training for PhD and MSc. Trainees will have ample opportunities at OSU leveraged with research areas including rotavirus, salmonellosis, tuberculosis and Leishmaniasis. Track 2 will involve a short-term training that will target laboratory technologists. This research training program also will strengthen intra-regional collaboration among scientists including veterinarians, physicians and environmental health scientists to effectively address zoonotic diseases."
"9402074","During the past five year period, this Merit Award has permitted us to focus on molecular ?epigenomic? strategies that combinatorially regulate programs of gene transcription. These include identifying new epigenetic regulators; defining signatures of active enhancers; and providing evidence that enhancers mediating actions of liganded nuclear receptors are themselves regulated transcription units, transcribing functionally important eRNAs. We have also identified new histone modifications and elucidated their biological functions, and contributed to the growing evidence for dynamic three-dimensional interaction/reorganization of specific genomic regions. Finally, we have provided initial evidence that lncRNAs could exert their biological functions based on their actions to allosterically modify functions of RNA-binding proteins, and of retinoic acid receptor regulation of Pol III-dependent Alu repeat transcription units and their roles in biological processes. Specific contributions include: elucidating the roles of PHF8, PHF2 and SMYD5 in transcriptional regulation; identifying roles of a tissue-specific splice variant of LSD1; finding a novel tyrosine phosphorylation of H2A and; demonstrating the role of JMJD6 demethylase as a regulator of pause-release by actions on specific enhancers. We characterized the E2-regulated enhancer program and the ligand-dependent increase in eRNA transcription as a signature of functional enhancers. We identified the recruitment of the MegaTrans complex and Condensins I and II to these functional enhancers. Using Pit1 as a model, we also demonstrated the requirement for Pit1-dependent enhancer interactions with the Matrin3-rich network for effective activation of homeodomain-dependent transcriptional programs in the endocrine system. We propose to continue our work in this extension by exploring the roles of nuclear receptors in regulating negative, as well as positive, enhancer-dependent transcriptional programs, defining the roles of JMJD6 in these programs, and roles of modified long-distance interactions in dictating the chromosomal alterations underlying regulated transcriptional response. We will use genetic approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of super-enhancer regulation of endocrine developmental programs in the endocrine system. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Under this MERIT Award, we have contributed to understanding the enhancer-dependent strategies regulating broad gene transcriptional programs. We will continue and extend these studies in the MERIT Extension period by investigating global enhancer interaction networks; mechanisms of negative as well as positive gene transcriptional regulatory programs; and elucidating developmental roles of component enhancers in superenhancers in the endocrine system."
"9616531","Detection of Methylation and Translocation Events by Novel Sequencing Technology ABSTRACT  The rapid development of DNA sequencing technologies advanced our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer. However, cancer genomics involves very complex molecular rearrangements, such as translocations, requiring the investigation of long DNA molecules with single nucleotide discrimination. Current Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies cannot address such performance requirements and face challenging limitations.  The long term goal of this proposal is to develop a rapid and highly accurate DNA sequencing system that has the potential to fully control the speed and orientation at which the DNA passes through an electronic detector (solid state) both in forward (reading) and reverse (proof read) directions. In contrast with other nanopore technologies, our technology decouples the feeding step from the reading step, enabling to sequence full genomes starting with minute quantity of material. Combined, the characteristics have the potential to provide our sequencing technology with the capability to achieve single nucleotide discrimination with an accuracy of 99.9% or higher using long DNA molecules (200kb). Such a system is anticipated to be capable of accurately reading such long fragments of DNA starting from minute quantities of material without the need of amplification. This would provide both practitioners and cancer researchers with a much better tool than the current state of the art sequencing technologies. Indeed we project that our technology will enable the collection of information of genetic and epigenetic markers of cancer both in expressed and non expressed areas of the genome while reaching time and cost performance metrics currently unachieved on the market.  The goal of the current Phase 1 (R43) proposal is to demonstrate that by incorporating our proprietary technology into a sequencing system, we will be able to detect important molecular changes that are associated with cancer initiation and proliferation, to include long range methylations and translocations as well as chromoplexy. Such detection will be rendered possible due to the ability of our system to fully control the translocation rate and linearization of the DNA while passing through the sequencing system detector.  In Phase II (R44) will focus on the incorporation of an embedded solid state (electronic) nano- electrode detection component to the initial system developed in phase I for single base nucleotide reading. Provided that targeted milestones are achieved, commercial development of a prototype instrument along with associated consumable chips and reagents will be initiated immediately following the completion of phase II.  We project that our technology has the potential to sequence a full human genome in less than one hour at the cost of $200 from biopsy material, thus reaching performance metrics currently unavailable on the current market, and providing cancer researchers and medical practitioners with an invaluable affordable tool for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of cancer and the detection of specific molecular changes which may improve early clinical detection of the disease."
"9417005","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Macular edema is the most common cause of visual loss among patients with uveitis. Although there are multiple approaches to the treatment of uveitis macular edema, no comparative trials of these treatments have been performed. The goal of this proposal is to address two critical issues in the treatment of uveitis macular edema: 1) the optimal initial treatment for uveitis macular edema; and 2) the optimal treatment of persistent macular edema (i.e. macular edema that has not resolved after initial treatment). Regional corticosteroid injections are the mainstay of treatment for uveitis macular edema. However, there are different routes and formulations, which never have been compared in a trial, and the lack of definitive trials has led to considerable variability in clinical practice. or persistent macular edema, repeat injections of corticosteroids typically are administered. However, pilot studies of intravitreal methotrexate and of intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis) have suggested efficacy, possibly with fewer ocular side effects than corticosteroid injections, although in the case of ranibizumab possibly with more frequent injections. No comparative trials have been performed of these approaches. The existing MUST Research Group infrastructure will be leveraged to perform two comparative effectiveness clinical trials on the treatment of uveitis macular edema. The specific aims of the trials are: 1) to compare the relative effectiveness of periocular triamcinolone acetonide, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (Triescence), and the intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) for the treatment of uveitis macular edema; and 2) to compare the relative effectiveness of intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis) and intravitreal methotrexate to the intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) for the treatment of uveitis macular edema that persists after intravitreal triamcinolone injections. The results of these trials will guide clinicians regarding the best approaches for management of uveitis macular edema. The MUST Research Group is uniquely suited to address these issues based upon both its breadth of expertise and proven track record, demonstrated by the successful completion of the MUST Trial and by the ongoing MUST Follow-up Study of participants in the MUST Trial."
"9468980","Project Summary Gestation is a critical window during which chemical exposure may lead to profound impacts on neurodevelopment and behavior. The placenta provides important supportive functions for the developing brain, including the secretion of hormones, monoamines and other growth factors which nurture the developing brain. Following the phase out of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) alternative chemical flame retardants (FRs) have become ubiquitous contaminants in the home but their toxicity remains largely unknown. We have shown that the alternative mixture known as Firemaster® 550 (FM 550) is a developmental neuroendocrine disruptor that has sex specific impacts on behavior. Almost nothing is known about the mechanisms by which FM 550 can impact the developing brain. Our preliminary data suggest disruption of placental function may play a role. Therefore the proposed studies seek to establish a novel connection between altered placental function and brain development as potential mechanism by which FM 550 impacts the developing brain. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that prenatal FM 550 exposure sex-specifically reduces forebrain serotonin innervation. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the placenta is a direct target of toxicity by testing for depleted serotonin synthesis and secretion during late gestation. This aim will focus specifically on the syncytiotrophoblast cell layer, which is the primary source of serotonin for the fetal brain during late gestation. Importantly, these studies will use a dose range of FM 550 considered environmentally relevant. These experiments will be the first to study the impact of FM 550 on the placenta and gestational brain, and stand out in terms of innovation because they will be among the first to establish a direct connection between chemical induced placental dysfunction and altered brain development."
"9438542","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mucolipidosis type IV (ML IV) is a severe lysosomal storage disorder characterized by mental and psychomotor retardation, retinal degeneration and corneal opacity, iron deficiency, and achlorhydria (low stomach acid level). Children with ML IV often exhibit cognitive retardation, language and motor deficits, and blindness, and typically reach a maximum developmental age of 18 months in language and motor function. This devastating disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding TRPML1, a member of the transient receptor potential mucolipin (TRPML) subfamily of the TRP family of ion channels. TRPML1 channels are primarily found in intracellular organelles, especially late endosomes and lysosomes, of many cell types. They are non-selective cation channels, permeable to all monovalent cations. Importantly, TRPML1 channels are permeable to Ca2+ and Fe2 and therefore likely critical for Ca2+ signaling in lysosomes. The physiological function of TRPML1 in lysosomes and how its dysfunction leads to ML IV are largely unclear. The objective of this project is to study the structure, regulation, physiological functions and pathogenic mechanisms of TRPML1. Lysosomes are enriched in lipids, contain high concentrations of luminal Ca2+ and Fe2+, and have a low pH of ~4.5. TRPML1 channels permeate both Ca2+ and Fe2+ and are regulated by luminal Ca2+ and pH. These properties may be crucial for the physiological functions of TRPML1 channels, but the molecular and biophysical mechanisms underlying them are unclear. Obtaining high-resolution structures of functionally important domains of TRPML1 would greatly enhance our understanding of TRPML1 channel physiology and pathophysiology. We have solved the crystal structure of a ~210-amino acid linker (named the I-II linker) between the first two transmembrane segments of TRPML1, a region necessary for channel function. Importantly, this linker harbors three single amino acid mutations that cause ML IV. The structure shows that the I-II linker forms a tetramer with a pore (called the luminal pore) in the center. The luminal pore is has a diameter of ~14 Å and is lined by a luminal pore-loop containing three aspartate residues and a putative serine lipase site, which appears catalytically inactive. Using this crystal structure as a blueprint, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Studying the role of the I-II linker in TRPML1 assembly and lysosomal targeting; (2) Studying the effect of I-II linker ML IV-causing mutations on TRPML1 assembly, targeting and activity; (3) Investigating the role of the I-II linker in Ca2+ and Fe2+ permeation and whether TRPML1-mediated Ca2+ and Fe2+ signaling is crucial for lysosome physiology; (4) Testing the hypothesis that the I-II linker is critical for the regulation of TRPML1 channels by luminal pH and Ca2+ and that this dual regulation is important for lysosome physiology. These studies will yield mechanistic insights into TRPML1 channel functions, shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of ML IV, and lay a foundation for the development of treatment strategies for this devastating disease."

"9457509","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South America faces a changing epidemiological environment with a mix of endemic and emerging challenges. Past challenges have covered a broad range of ailments moving from SARS to avian and pandemic influenza and dengue hemorrhagic fever. We are now threatened by the imminent emergence of Chikungunya virus, the rise of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in the Guyana shield and the spread of visceral leishmaniasis in the southern cone. An adequate response to emerging infections requires epidemiologists with advanced research training. However, there are no doctoral programs of international caliber in resource- limited countries like Peru. The NAMRU-6/UPCH/UNMSM/UFMG/JHBSPH/USUHS/CDC consortium proposes to substantially expand our ability to train doctoral-level investigators in a cost-effective and sustainable way, fosterin a new generation of international-caliber scientists. Specifically, we will create a four-year doctorl program in Epidemiology in Peru and will enroll two four-student classes. Additionally, we will reinsert seven PhDs scientists in Peru upon completion of coursework while another seven PhD students/graduates enroll in world-class programs. Our Brazilian partners will prove to be critical for this activity. We will add another 90 graduates from our self-sustainable Epidemiology Masters' program, ~25% conducting infectious diseases research and ~20% working in the public sector. Finally, we will train 200 undergraduate students in short research methods courses or laboratory/field rotations to establish the foundation of a new generation of scientists in Peru who can address the control of emerging and parasitic infections. The viability of our approach is supported by our substantial track record accomplished during our previous awards. We have provided international doctoral training for eight Peruvian scientists and five additional Masters' graduates have started doctoral coursework. Furthermore, we have offered our Masters' program seven years in a row training 184 Latin American students. Our consortium has published 60 papers and our Masters' students have produced 152 papers after graduation, duplicating their rate of articles published per year as compared to before their training. Moving forward, competitive research funding from the Department of Defense will be critical to provide long-term career sustainability to our trainees. Training will take place in a ich environment supported by DoD and NIH collaborations in extensive multi-year research projects. Our proposal is supported by a large pool of highly trained local and foreign mentors, sophisticated laboratories, and diverse field and clinical sites: 45 organizations, 32 PhD scientists residing permanently in Peru and 116 letters of support documents a solid regional collaboration."
"9469895","Summary Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) play a critical role in the etiology and progression of many vascular diseases including atherosclerosis and restenosis. Reduction of inflammatory gene expression in VSMC is a rational approach to limit the severity of these diseases. Our laboratory has found that one anti-inflammatory interleukin, IL-19, can decrease vascular inflammation by reduction in mRNA stability of inflammatory transcripts by reduction of activity of HuR, an mRNA stability protein. HuR translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it recognizes elements present almost exclusively in the 3'UTR of pro-inflammatory genes. Proteins and pathways which limit HuR translocation are understudied, but may reduce inflammatory mRNA stability. Using MASS SPEC to identify HuR-interacting proteins under different inflammatory conditions, we identified one protein, Fragile X-related protein (FXR1), which interacts with HuR in inflammatory, but not basal conditions. FXR1 is a putative mRNA binding protein, but its interaction with HuR is novel. Interestingly, FXR1 mRNA expression is enhanced in muscle cells, and its promoter contains multiple cholesterol-response elements. Nothing has been reported on expression of FXR1 in VSMC or function for FXR1 in vascular disease. Nothing at all has been reported on FXR1 interaction with HuR in any other cell. Our preliminary data shows that FXR1 expression is increased in injured arteries and TNF? and oxLDL stimulated human VSMC, as well as by IL-19. However, siRNA knock down of FXR1 in VSMC increases abundance of inflammatory proteins; therefore, our overall hypothesis is that FXR1 expression and HuR interaction is an inflammation responsive, counter-regulatory mechanism to reduce abundance of pro-inflammatory proteins. The overall goal of this application is twofold: 1- to characterize the molecular mechanisms of FXR1 function in regulation of HuR activity and mRNA stability of pro-inflammatory transcripts in VSMC, and; 2- determine if modulation of FXR1 activity or expression can reduce severity of vascular restenosis. Very little is understood concerning negative regulation of inflammatory mRNA stability, and nothing at all is known about FXR1 expression and function in VSMC and vascular disease. The completion of these aims will clarify molecular mechanisms of anti-inflammatory compounds and uncover a novel role for FXR1 in vascular disease."
"9540492","PROJECT SUMMARY Although major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and is one of the most burdensome diseases in the world, understanding of its etiology is limited. Research has shown that the development of depression is multiply determined by biological and psychosocial factors. The emerging and exciting field of behavioral epigenetics lies at the intersection of biological and environmental explanations for disorder in positing that stressful life events ?get under the skin? through epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation to confer risk for depression. Using data from over 1,000 adolescents in a longitudinal birth cohort study in the UK (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children; ALSPAC) we aim to conduct (1) epigenome-wide analyses (measuring DNA methylation at birth and in adolescence) to identify genes that are differentially methylated in adolescents who are on a high vs. low depression trajectory, (2) epigenome-wide analyses to identify associations between stressful life events (in utero and in early adolescence) and DNA methylation at the corresponding development period, and (3) mediational analyses to test the indirect effect of stressful life events in utero and in adolescence on depression symptom trajectories in adolescence via DNA methylation. The proposed research would be the first to test the full pathway by which stressful life events increase risk for depression via epigenetic modifications. The proposed research is highly innovative in applying a developmental lens to the question of how stressful exposures become biologically embedded. This developmental approach will be used to refine the depression phenotype (by identifying trajectory groups who are homogeneous in symptom onset, course, and severity) and to ask questions that are novel to behavioral epigenetics, including questions about sensitive periods for the effect of stressful life events and epigenetic alterations and questions about the stability of epigenetic modifications over time. Because research has shown that epigenetic markings are reversible, the proposed research has the potential to inform efforts to prevent the onset and recurrence of depression. This project and the accompanying training plan will prepare the applicant for a research career investigating epigenetic modifications as potential mechanisms by which exposure to various forms of stress is translated into risk for psychopathology."
"9414049","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary cilia organize signaling pathways such as vision, olfaction and the Hedgehog developmental pathway. The movements of signaling receptors into, inside and out of cilium are critical for the correct regulation of these pathways, yet our understanding of the basic mechanisms governing signaling receptor trafficking through cilia remains fragmentary.  The major goal of this proposal is to study the BBSome, a protein complex that ferries signaling receptors into, inside and out of cilia. The emphasis in this fundin period will be on investigating the turnaround point during which anterograde trains become reconfigured into retrograde trains. While past studies have provided circumstantial evidence for the existence of IFT train turnaround at the tip of cilia, molecular mechanisms are lacking for thi critical step that commits molecules to be removed from cilia. The removal of signaling receptors from cilia may serve to desensitize cilia to specific stimuli and the ciliary export of signaling intermediates such as the Hedgehog effector and transcription Gli3 is required for them to reach their nuclear target. Yet, how molecules are exported from cilia remains elusive. Our preliminary data suggest a testable molecular model for the turnaround point and the assembly of retrograde BBSome/IFT trains. We will test this model using biochemistry and innovative live cell photokinetics assay."
"9407018","ABSTRACT : Project 4 - Image-guided and model-based dosimetry for optimal PDT  Project 4 focuses on novel technologies and tools for advancing the ability to image PDT dose or  response to therapy at the levels of structural, functional and molecular interactions. The design is  specifically on testing new approaches which link to the two clinical trial projects in skin and pancreas  tumors. In aim 1, the range of technologies to quantify protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in skin and the  biophysical measures of blood flow, blood volume, oxygen saturation and collagen, are measured  alongside high frequency US imaging. The focus is to establish a set of tools which allow intelligent  combinations of enhancers to PpIX production in squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma, as being  treated in Project 1. Aims 2 and 3 both focus on pancreas cancer (PanCa) working with Project 2, with  an initial focus on using contrast-CT and US to track total blood volume in the tumors, prior to light  therapy and in the response to treatment. Preliminary Phase 1 clinical data indicates that total blood  volume, as estimated from contrast-CT, is the dominant dosimetric parameter which predicts lesion  volume in the response, suggesting that PS measurement is less important than light dosimetry for this  particular indication. This observation is followed up in a systematic series of studies in a large animal  orthotopic tumor model in the rabbit pancreas, as a way to better simulate the clinical trial data using  contrast CT. Aim 3 further develops our work on molecular imaging and the quantification of binding in  vivo with project 3. Using a dual-tracer approach developed in the current funding period, we analyze  the efficiency of binding-directed uptake of targeted nanocells, from in an orthotopic PanCa model. This  quantification importantly allows separation of vascular leakage and interstitial transport from the more  important information of binding and uptake in the cancer cells. We will test methods to improve  interstitial transport and determine if the nanoconstructs are limited by binding or delivery in PanCa. In  the end, this series of aims is both basic technology and methodology design and optimization with  direct potential to translate into clinical trial use. It is our expectation that the results will be directly  translate to impact the clinical trials within this proposed funding period, with technology transfer  occurring through Core C to each of the other projects.    RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Project 4 develops novel tools and techniques which will directly advance the ability to monitor  treatment at the individual subject level. The resulting approaches can be used in humans during PDT  treatment to plan dose delivery or monitor treatment to either better understand variation in response  or to alter therapy to minimize the variation in response. Dosimetry planning and imaging, when done  well, will improve therapeutic delivery."
"9569602","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The long-term goal of this project is to develop a novel oncolytic vaccinia virus (VV) for the treatment of advanced stage solid tumors. The prognosis for patients with advanced stage solid tumors remains poor and bio-therapeutics such as VVs have the potential to improve outcomes. While VVs have shown promising antitumor activity in early Phase clinical studies, few patients have been cured. This lack of efficacy is most likely due to the inability of VVs to kill all tumor cells and/or induce effective antitumoral immune responses. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are key players in promoting tumor growth and creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, recent studies have shown that the inherent phagocytic capacity of TAMs can be harnessed to induce antitumor responses by blocking CD47 on tumor cells and provision of an opsonization signal using a chimeric molecule that consists of the high affinity ectodomain of SIRP? fused to the Fc region of IgG4 (SIRP?-Fc). We now propose to adapt this approach to oncolytic VVs and hypothesize that an oncolytic VV that is genetically modified to express SIRP?-Fc (SIRP?-Fc-VV) will have enhanced antitumor activity in comparison to unmodified VV. Local production of SIRP?-Fc should also be superior to the intermittent direct infusion of the protein, both because the concentration of SIRP?-Fc should be highest at the sites of tumor and because it reduces the risks of unwanted side effects associated with the systemic administration of SIRP?-Fc. Since macrophages are potent antigen presenting cells, we hypothesize further that SIRP?-Fc-VV-induced phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages will result in the induction of tumor associated antigen (TAA)-specific T cells. We propose to test our hypotheses in 2 interrelated research aims. Aim 1 generates SIRP?-Fc-VV and SIRP?-VV, and compares their ability to replicate in tumor cells and activate macrophages in vitro. Aim 2 will then evaluate the antitumor activity of SIRP?-Fc-VV and SIRP?-VV in the B16 melanoma model, and assess their ability to induce B16 TAA-specific T-cell responses. If successful, this approach could be readily applied to oncolytic viruses that are currently being developed for a broad range of solid tumors."
"9352559","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Determining the clinical effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their mechanism of action in treating refractory lupus is of significant importance. We and others have reported reproducible improvement in murine models of lupus following allogeneic MSC infusions from healthy mice or humans. Infusion of MSCs, derived from bone marrow or umbilical cords, in more than 100 treatment-refractory lupus patients has resulted in positive clinical benefit in 65-75% of those treated. However, a placebo-controlled trial of MSCs in lupus has not been performed to show definitively that MSCs are more effective than standard of care. One clear result from multiple trials of MSCs to date is that they can be given safely with almost no serious adverse events. The preclinical data, the uncontrolled trials and the safety profile create a mandate for a controlled trial to test the efficacy of MSCs as a therapeutic for lupus. Critical to this trial are mechanistic studies to define how MSCs impact disease. Prior studies in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis reported increased circulating Treg cells, decreased Th17 cells, decreased TFH cells and fewer activated B and plasma cells in patients after MSC infusion. The mechanism by which these cellular effects occur is unknown. We have found that lupus patients have decreased circulating levels of glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP)/TGF? complexes. MSCs express GARP, and GARP is a major determinant of TGF? bioactivity and also has important enhancing effects on Treg number and function. We hypothesize that allogeneic MSC infusion, plus standard of care, will prove significantly more effective in treating lupus patients with active disease than standard of care alone. We further hypothesize that effects of MSCs in lupus occur via modulation of regulatory and pathogenic T and B cells through upregulation of GARP expression, resulting in enhanced TGF? bioactivity and increased Treg numbers and activity. To test these hypotheses, our specific aims are to:  1. Determine the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell therapy in a two-dose escalation double-  blind placebo-controlled multi-center trial as a treatment for lupus patients with moderate to severe  disease activity unresponsive to standard of care therapy compared to ongoing standard of care.  2. Define mechanistically how MSCs modulate regulatory and pathogenic T and B cells in lupus patients  and the role of GARP-mediated TFG? bioactivity in this process. The proposed trial will be performed in six academic centers that are all skilled, successful and experienced in performing lupus trials. If we confirm that MSC therapy is as effective as reported, then MSC infusions may become an alternative therapy for lupus. The detailed mechanistic analysis will provide novel insight into the complex cellular matrix in lupus and the impact MSCs have on these cellular interactions. There is a defined FDA pathway for licensing cellular therapies allowing this therapy, if effective, to be translated to the clinic."
"9555021","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death. Blood vessel replacement is a common treatment for vascular diseases. However, autologous grafts are limited by the availability, the need for additional surgeries and the morbidity of the donor sites, and synthetic vascular grafts are limited to large-diameter blood vessels due to thrombosis and failure in small diameter grafts. The tissue engineering approach is promising and can improve the biocompatibility and the performance of vascular grafts, but the in vitro fabrication of cellular grafts takes weeks, is expensive, and is difficult to scale upfor clinical applications. A clinically viable strategy is in-situ tissue engineering, wherein an acellular, bioactive and bioabsorbable vascular graft can effectively recruit endogenous cells to self-regenerate the blood vessel. In the past few years, we have developed acellular, bioactive microfibrous vascular grafts that can be made available off-the-shelf. The grafts are anti-thrombogenic and can recruit endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) for enhanced endothelialization and long-term patency; the grafts also recruit mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and bioabsorb to facilitate tissue remodeling and maturation. We have identified a novel type of MSCs that are Sox10+ and can differentiate into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vascular grafts. However, the mechanisms of MSC or SMC recruitment remains to be determined, and whether a MMP cleavage-resistant stromal cell-derived factor-1a (SDF-1a) and the porosity of vascular grafts can lead to better graft performance is not clear. Furthermore, validation of this novel approach in a large animal model is necessary for the translation towards clinical therapies. We hypothesize that: (1) A MMP cleavage-resistant form of SDF-1a, S-SDF-1(S4V), will increase its stability and further enhance the endothelialization and the remodeling of vascular grafts, (2) the increase in the porosity of vascular grafts will facilitate the recruitment/infiltration of MSCs and accelerate vascular graft remodeling, and (3) during the regeneration of vascular grafts, MSCs rather than mature SMCs are recruited for the remodeling. To test our hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed: (1) To investigate whether S- SDF-1(S4V) increase the recruitment of EPCs and MSCs and the remodeling of vascular grafts in the rat and mouse lineage tracing models; (2) To determine how the porosity of vascular grafts regulate the recruitment of MSCs and the remodeling of the grafts in the rat model; (3) To investigate the effects of S- SDF-1(S4V) and graft porosity on the recruitment of EPCs and MSCs and the endothelialization and the remodeling of vascular grafts in a swine model. The accomplishment of this project will advance our understanding on the roles of stem cells and progenitor cells in the regeneration of blood vessels, and will lead to the development of the next generation of vascular grafts that are available off-the-shelf, bioactive, and can recruit endogenous stem cells for in situ remodeling."

"9548758","This proposal is the third renewal of our Global Infectious Disease training grant (D43 TW005884) entitled, Training and Research in Severe Malarial Anemia (SMA). Our International Malaria Training and Research Program (IMTRP) was established in 2002 (PD/PI, D. Perkins). During the current funding cycle, trainees were highly prolific in generating peer-reviewed manuscripts and presenting at international meetings. Based on current scientific training needs identified in Kenya, we will focus on thematic target areas: (1) genomics/bioinformatics (2) drug/vaccine discovery and (3) biostatistics and epidemiological/mathematical modeling. The strategic training approach is based on success by past and current trainees who identified genetic pathways that mediate development of SMA, thereby, providing the foundation for discovery of novel treatment options. Engagement of trainees in targeted focus areas that support improved therapeutic options comes at an opportune time since treatment and management of SMA has been met with very limited success. The next phase of activities will continue long-standing partnerships between the University of New Mexico (UNM) and our Kenyan collaborators (Kenyatta and Maseno Universities and Kenya Medical Research Institute), and a new academic site (Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology). We have also included our collaborative partners from Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), along with the newly established West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens (WACCBIP), University of Ghana. Formation of WACCBIP is based on two recent capacity-building grants ($15.9M) awarded to a former PhD trainee in the IMTRP. Since the training mission for WACCBIP includes mentoring Kenyan scientists, we will provide joint training and synergize our activities. Moving forward, we propose training for current doctoral students (2) and MSc students (2) who will transition to PhD studies. Through cost-sharing with WACCBIP, we will also jointly train additional doctoral candidates (4-6), and two postdoctoral fellows per year (10 total). Long- term training (12 mos.) will be offered for specialized training at UNM and/or LANL for one postdoctoral fellow/year, and for medium-term training (6 to 9 mos.) of two to three scientists/year. We will also train junior faculty (1-2) in each year of the grant and offer competitively awarded re-entry grants to support transitioning to independent investigator status (1 per year). Short-term, in-depth training in the focus areas will also be offered through annual workshops in Kenya. The overall training paradigm will foster sustained establishment of independent researchers in Kenya. Expansion of our highly successful training program in the next phase is based on over $120M in annual funding for the multidisciplinary team assembled. Collectively, the training platform will also provide the technology transfer and capacity-building required for establishing a critical mass of Kenyan scientists to address the challenging public health problems facing their society."
"9439815","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A grand challenge in biomolecular research is to rationally design antibodies that bind to target antigens with high affinity and specificity. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate principles for designing the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibody fragments to mediate recognition of aggregated proteins with conformational and sequence specificity. Our proposal is based on our recent discovery that single-domain antibodies can be designed to recognize A?42 oligomers and fibrils using the same molecular interactions mediating A? aggregation associated with Alzheimer's disease (Perchiacca et al., PNAS, 2012). We find that hydrophobic A? peptides can be grafted into a single CDR loop, and the resulting Grafted AMyloid-Motif AntiBODIES (gammabodies) bind to A? oligomers and fibrils with nanomolar affinity. Based on these discoveries, we posit that additional A? peptides capable of mediating gammabody binding can be predicted based on their relative amyloidogenicity. We also hypothesize that the binding affinity of gammabodies will be maximal at small to intermediate CDR lengths that are sufficiently long to display A? self-recognition peptides but not long enough to disfavor binding due to increased entropy. In addition, we posit that our design approach is not limited to A? and can be extended to other amyloidogenic polypeptides, including IAPP (type 2 diabetes) and ?-synuclein (Parkinson's disease). Finally, we hypothesize that even higher-affinity gammabodies can be designed by grafting multiple amyloidogenic peptides into anti-parallel CDRs that are oriented in the same manner as the corresponding peptides at the growing (templating) ends of fibrils. Therefore, in Aim 1, we propose to determine how the length and sequence of CDR3 impacts the binding affinity and specificity for two A? gammabodies (A?15-24 and A?33-42). Then, in Aim 2, we propose to evaluate our predictions of additional A? peptides that mediate gammabody binding to A? aggregates when grafted into CDR3. Next, in Aim 3, we propose to extend the analysis performed in Aims 1 and 2 to evaluate our predictions of peptide segments from two other amyloid-forming polypeptides (?-synuclein and IAPP) that mediate gammabody binding to their corresponding aggregated conformers when grafted into CDR3. Finally, in Aim 4, we propose to evaluate whether the affinity of the A? and IAPP gammabodies developed in Aims 1-3 can be increased by grafting two different amyloidogenic peptides into anti-parallel CDRs to match the orientation of the corresponding peptides at the growing ends of fibrils. A significant outcome of our studies will be the elucidation of how self-complementary, amyloidogenic peptides can be used to mediate antibody-antigen recognition. We expect that our findings will lead to rules for designing of similar single- and multidomain antibodies with specificity for diverse amyloidogenic proteins, including those linked to human aggregation disorders such as Huntington's and prion diseases."
"9624864","PROJECT SUMMARY: ABSTRACT I (the candidate) am an academic faculty in adult epileptology, with strong clinical training and a PhD doctorate in applied mathematics from Oxford University where I was a Rhodes scholar. I have a career commitment to patient-oriented research, and have achieved preliminary success in applying my skills to important scientific problems in epilepsy. In 2007 I was awarded a Milken Family Foundation Early Career Award from the American Epilepsy Society that enabled me to commence work on a promising and novel imaging technique (oxygen-enhanced MRI; OE-MRI) for the diagnosis of focal epilepsy. In 2010, I was co-PI on a seed grant from the Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences at UTHSC-Houston to explore OE-MRI under conditions of functional activation. These small awards have resulted in intriguing and promising pilot data. I now wish to protect my time to build the solid foundation of a long-term research career in epilepsy neuroimaging, under the mentorship of senior established investigators. My research project will advance the application of OE-MRI (achieved by subjects breathing 100% oxygen during scanning) for better anatomical diagnosis of focal epilepsy, and for noninvasive identification of eloquent cortex. Identifying an imaging lesion remains crucial in the workup of focal epilepsy patients, particularly those for whom epilepsy surgery is planned. Yet upto 30% of all refractory focal epilepsy patients have normal imaging, even with the most advanced techniques in routine clinical use (high-field strength MRI and PET). In recently published pilot studies (Kalamangalam et al (2011), Epilepsy Research ? manuscript appended), I have demonstrated that OE produces a robust and diagnostically useful contrast MRI signal that achieves diagnosis and lateralization of temporal lobe epilepsy with good sensitivity and perfect specificity. In particular, OE can be lateralizing in the complete absence of MRI or PET abnormalities. I wish to extend these exciting findings on a longer term prospective basis to larger patient groups with both temporal lobe and neocortical epilepsies (Specific Aim I). An important, though different, concern in epilepsy surgery patients is the precise localization of eloquent cortex (mainly language, motor function and memory laterality). The gold standard tests for all these modalities are invasive (electrical stimulation mapping for language and motor, and the Wada test for memory). However, the strong contrast signal produced by 100% oxygen suggested that classical fMRI methods applied to detect eloquent cortex would be more informative under OE conditions, leading to improved nonivasive estimates of eloquent cortical areas than has been possible hitherto. My preliminary data with normal subjects indicates that this premise may be true. I wish to explore these intriguing results on a long-term prospective basis in our epilepsy surgery patients (Specific Aim II). The training and career development aspects of the award will comprise a thorough grounding in modern neuroimaging, focusing on MRI and fMRI, experiment design, data analysis and interpretation. I will also complete training in general clinical research methods. Training will be achieved with mix of didactic sessions with my primary mentor, Dr Ponnada A Narayana, an MRI scientist of international standing, and attendance at national training workshops. I will also complete selected courses in advanced neuroscience offered at UTHSC?s graduate school. I will also receive structured training in biostatistics, translational research and epidemiologic methods offered by the Center for Clinical Research and Evidenced- Based Medicine, which will be supervised by my co-mentor Dr James A Ferrendelli, our former Chairman and past President of the American Epilepsy Society. The institutional facilities and infrastructure available to me via the MRI Research Division and the Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences at UTHSC-Houston are the ideal setting in which to accomplish my goals. Our epilepsy clinical service ? comprising the outpatient environment of UT Physicians and the inpatient Epilepsy Monitoring Unit of Memorial Hermann Hospital ? follows >1500 patients yearly, providing a sufficient patient population base for recruitment of study subjects for my research. My department Chair, Dr James Grotta, guarantees 75% protected time for my research, in addition to providing any secretarial and administrative support required. I also have a supportive cohort of faculty colleagues at all career stages, including senior NIH-funded clinical researchers. At the end of the K23 award period I will be ideally placed to apply for an NIH RO1 grant to pursue an independent clinical research career in epilepsy neuroimaging. In doing so, I will be firmly on the path of my long-term goal of a clinical research career in academic epileptology."
"9415391","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a combined field and laboratory approach investigating large-scale cognitive spatial mapping in the blind through virtual navigation, and assessing the transference of acquired spatial knowledge in real-world indoor and outdoor navigation tasks.  Training and evaluation of navigation performance will be carried out with a user-centered, computer-based navigation software platform called Haptic Audio Game Application (HAGA).  This software was developed to assist in orientation and mobility (O&M) training by introducing blind users to an unfamiliar environment through immersive, simulation-based virtual navigation.  Using iconic and spatialized auditory cues and vibro-tactile feedback, a visually impaired user learns to build a cognitive spatial map of their surrounding environment.  Using a self-directed, free exploration strategy, users interact with HAGA to navigate through a simulated indoor and outdoor virtual environment that represents an actual physical space (i.e. a school campus).  In the first aim of the study, we will compare spatial cognitive map development in early and late blind as well as low vision individuals using the HAGA software versus a group learning setting in which participants learn the layout of the campus using a tactile map.  The ability to transfer acquired spatial information will then be assessed with navigation tasks carried out in the actual physical environment.  In a second aim of the study, we will investigate the neural correlates associated with virtual navigation and prolonged training.  Using functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we will identify and compare the neural networks associated with these skills in early blind and sighted individuals.  The innovative combination of an intervention clinical trial study and hypothesis-driven neuroscience investigation will better inform the future design of assistive technology and broad-based O&M training for the blind.  From a clinical perspective, this work will have potentially important implications in terms of rehabilitative training by improving navigation skils and promoting independence, while dispelling anecdotal preconceptions regarding the abilities (and disabilities) of the blind and visually impaired."

"9460585","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will provide an innovative contribution to the field of science learning by developing a new generation of learning materials that blends formal and informal learning experiences that relate gene- environment interactions to natural selection and ties these interactions to health issues of relevance to community members using the core ideas from the Framework for K-12 Science Education and the Next Generation Science Standards. The digital curriculum materials we will develop will provide 7th and 8th grade students with a framework for learning genomics (including gene-environment relationships) and evolution. The materials will use the approach of inquiry-based science education, will incorporate multi-media materials and the use of interactive technology by students, will include ethical discussion of genomics issues, and will link informal and community activities to those that happen in the classroom. The materials will be developed utilizing a modified learning goals driven learning process that is the product of more than 20 years of science education research conducted by members of the project team.          The project will develop a model partnership joining the two universities developing the curriculum with the public school systems in Flint and Detroit, as well as science and history museums, libraries and community- based organizations in both communities. Museum exhibits will elaborate on topics covered in the curriculum, providing evidence for student classroom-assigned projects. Libraries and community-based organizations will host events at which students will share their work and will engage in discussion of ethical, social and policy issues related to genomics with their parents and other adults. Students will take field trips to genomics research facilities and genomics professionals will visit classrooms. These informal science education activities will be planned to strengthen student learning while advancing genomic literacy among the community.          The project's evaluation plan will incorporate formative and summative evaluation as the curriculum is designed, tested and iteratively revised, with interim summative assessment at the end of year 3 and final summative assessment in year 5, as the curriculum and community efforts are packaged for broader use. The project's dissemination plan will utilize publications, presentations, and an interactive web site to share the project's design, experience, and findings, both during its implementation and at the project's conclusion.          Since 75 percent of Detroit students and 96% of Detroit students are African American and Latino (combined) the project will reduce the achievement gap in science learning and stimulate interest among minorities to enter science and health careers."
"9663002","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia however it is underused particularly in the African American population. Low Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC), either baseline or during treatment (a drop in ANC below the threshold of 1500 mm3 currently mandates clozapine discontinuation) is a significant barrier to clozapine use in AA patients. Our pilot work finds that discontinuation of clozapine (particularly for neutropenia) in AA patients is over twice that in Caucasians. Recently the phenomenon of Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) in AAs has gained attention. BEN is frequent in AA with low ANCs, but is NOT associated with an increased risk for agranulocytosis or infection. Normative ranges for white blood cell (WBC) and ANC counts were established with Caucasian samples and clozapine guidelines in the US do not permit lower fluctuations of ANC. Unfortunately, lower fluctuations are often seen in persons with BEN, requiring clozapine discontinuation. Our pilot work has shown that AA BEN patients may be successfully treated with clozapine despite low ANC (outside current guidelines) with no greater risk of agranulocytosis. Our work to date, if supported by a larger study, suggests that clozapine could be safely used in people with BEN, improving access to clozapine treatment for AA patients with schizophrenia as well as evaluation for the first time the Duffy Antigen Receptor Chemokine (DARC) gene in relation to BEN and ANC levels. We aim to safely use clozapine in 250 black patients (100-120 in US and 130-150 in a SubSaharan Nigerian population) to examine the safety of use and the risk of agranulocytosis. Our study will evaluate ANC twice weekly for 3 months prior and weekly 6 months after clozapine initiation. We also plan to evaluate the fluctuating patterns of WBC and ANC (mean levels, within subject s.d., frequency and duration of mild, moderate or severe neutropenia, and requirement for initiation of extra monitoring for very low ANC) in psychotic patients with BEN."

"9456775","Growing evidence links posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Abnormal sleep is a modifiable behavior that is a known contributor to cardiovascular risk and a hallmark symptom of PTSD. Our preliminary data and data from other labs show that PTSD is associated with profound sleep disturbance and with abnormal autonomic function (dysautonomia) especially at night. We propose a rigorous twin study to test the new paradigm that abnormal sleep is linked in a bidirectional way with nighttime dysautonomia to increase cardiovascular risk in PTSD. We will add comprehensive autonomic and sleep assessments to an ongoing NHLBI-funded twin study of PTSD and ischemic heart disease (IHD), the Emory Twin Study Follow-up (ETSF). The ETSF will re-examine 180 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs (360 individuals) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry to reassess PTSD status and cardiac status using positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging. In a previous examination of this sample, we found that twins with PTSD had worse myocardial perfusion and coronary microvascular function compared with twins without PTSD. As part of the proposed ancillary study, we will add both at home and in-lab objective sleep and autonomic monitoring, which will allow for both ?real- world? and controlled psychophysiological assessments. Twins will undergo in-lab polysomnography when on site and will be equipped patches for electrocardiogram monitoring and actigraphy wristbands for sleep monitoring to use at home for 14 days. During their visit, they will be examined in a controlled environment which matches their brothers' and allows for the most controlled analyses of within-pair difference. We will address the following hypotheses: (1) Twins with PTSD will exhibit more disturbed sleep (shorter sleep duration, more sleep fragmentation, and more sleep-disordered breathing) compared with twins without PTSD. (2) Twins with PTSD will exhibit more nocturnal dysautonomia (lower nighttime HRV) compared with twins without PTSD. (3) Disturbed sleep and nighttime dysautonomia will be positively related to quantitative indicators of IHD using PET imaging, including perfusion deficits and lower coronary flow reserve. We will also explore dynamic associations among PTSD, sleep disturbance and dysautonomia in the lab and at home. Our proposed twin study should fill a significant gap in evidence regarding the mechanisms of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. If our hypotheses are met, this study will place abnormal sleep and nighttime altered autonomic function at the forefront as interrelated biobehavioral pathways linking PTSD to IHD. The long-term goal is to provide targets for novel interventions that collectively help reduce IHD risk, sleep disturbance, and PTSD symptom burden."
"9452950","Abstract: The primary goal of this independent research scientist award is to allow protected time for Dr. Colleen McClung to acquire new technical skills which will complement her ongoing research program in addiction biology. This award will allow her to become proficient in the use of cutting edge, in vivo calcium imaging technology to measure neuronal activity in behaving animals over periods of days to weeks. She will also learn how to process and analyze the large amounts of data that are associated with this technology. This will involve dynamic collaborations with prominent researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford University and Mt. Sinai University. This technology will expand and complement her existing studies which investigate the role of circadian proteins in reward-related brain regions in the pathophysiology of drug addiction. Specifically, they will allow her for the first time to measure neuronal activity over circadian time in specific neuronal populations in which circadian proteins have been manipulated. These studies will also complement her current collaborative translational projects which are aimed at understanding the influence of circadian rhythm misalignments in adolescents in the risk for substance abuse. This award will also allow protected time for Dr. McClung to interact with her clinical colleagues in psychiatry with the goal of forming a translational addiction center in the future focused on the influence of circadian rhythm and sleep disruptions. Thus this award will pave the way for future innovative research projects that will help us better understand and treat addiction disorders."
"9574002","PROJECT SUMMARY Human eyes are never at rest. Gaze redirections normally occur 2-3 times/second, separating periods of small, incessant eye movements. At ?rst glance, the function of eye movements seems obvious: they are necessary to bring and maintain the object of interest within the foveola, the highest acuity region of the retina. However, an overwhelming body of evidence, in part coming from our NIH-funded research, indicates that this view is simplistic and that, by reformatting a spatial scene into a spatiotemporal stimulus on the retina, eye movements serve fundamental visual functions beyond just orienting the foveola. Here we test several new hypotheses concerning less-obvious but equally critical roles for three main kinds of eye movements: saccades, pursuit, and ?xational drift (the eye jitter that continually occurs during ?xation). The research strategy consists of evaluating the effect of eye movements on the retinal input and the resulting consequences for neural coding, perception, and control. The experiments rely on state-of-the-art high-resolution measurements of human eye movements and gaze-contingent control of retinal stimulation. All experiments are supported by mathematical modeling of visual input signals and neural modeling of their encoding consequences. Aim 1 focuses on the physiological alternation between saccades and ?xational drift. Stereotyped, saccade-induced transients are followed by stereotyped, but distinct, periods of Brownian-like jitter of the retinal image. Our preliminary analyses show that this alternation repackages the energy of natural scenes into different spatiotemporal formats, cyclically varying ampli?cation and spectral distribution within the temporal sensitivity bandwidth of retinal neurons. The predicted outcomes are oculomotor-driven dynamics of visual sensitivity, discrimination, and form perception during natural post- saccadic ?xation, which we will quantify and test. Aim 2 focuses on the saccades themselves. We predict that, as a consequence of a saccade, the spectral density of the visual input effective in driving retinal neurons at ?xation onset is equalized up to a cut-off spatial frequency that depends on the saccade amplitude. This effect further constrains visual dynamics and implies that visual coding during early ?xation depends on the amplitude of the preceding saccade. It also suggests that the visual system can exploit this tuning according to the task. We will test these predictions by isolating the contributions of saccade transients in a variety of low- and high-level visual tasks. Aim 3 further generalizes these ideas. Building on our modeling work, it examines whether ?xational drift can also be adjusted to tune visual sensitivity to the task demands, and whether the alternation between pursuit movements and ?catch-up? saccades during visual tracking plays a role similar to that of saccade/drift cycle for static targets. All our hypotheses are supported by preliminary data. They are, to our knowledge, entirely novel, and con?rmation of any of them will have broad implications for understanding the design principles of the visual system, possible oculomotor contributions to neuro-ophthalmologic disorders, and the development of rehabilitative strategies and prostheses."
"9481676","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating genetic muscular disorder of childhood manifested by progressive debilitating muscle weakness and wasting, and ultimately death in the second or third decade of life. We have made the surprising discovery that full-length dystrophin is expressed in activated satellite cells where it is required to establish Par complex mediated polarity. In the absence of dystrophin, the Par complex becomes dysregulated, the numbers of centrosomes becomes abnormally increased, and consequently satellite stem cells are unable to efficiently undergo asymmetric division. We hypothesize that this dysregulation of the Par complex impairs the satellite cell regenerative program and thus contributes to disease progression in DMD. We propose to investigate the molecular mechanisms through which dystrophin regulates the Par complex, characterize the biological consequences of the loss of polarity on the satellite cell regenerative program, and evaluate the ability of alternative regulatory pathways to restore asymmetric division. In Aim 1, the function of the Par complex in mdx satellite cells will be characterized. The axis of cell division in newly dividing satellite cells will be examined to determine whether the axis becomes randomized or otherwise altered. The composition of the Par complex will be investigated and the status of different modulators and effectors of polarity will be assessed. Finally, the findings will be validated in muscle biopsies obtained from DMD patients. These experiments will fully characterize the molecular nature of the polarity phenotype of dystrophin-deficient satellite cells and provide insight into the stem cell deficit in DMD patients. In Aim 2, we will assess how this loss of polarity control perturbs satellite cell self-renewal, expansion and differentiation during regenerative myogenesis. The regenerative program in mdx mice will be characterized by morphometric and immunohistological analyses after acute injury. Satellite cell engraftment assays will be conducted to assess the performance of dystrophin-deficient satellite cells in a wild type versus a dystrophin- deficient environment. Satellite cell function in mice lacking Par1b and p38? will be characterized. These experiments will reveal the functional role for polarity control in the satellite cell regenerative program. InAim 3, the ability of alternative regulatory mechanisms to stimulate asymmetric cell division in mdx satellite cells will be investigated. We have found that EGF stimulates asymmetric division of mdx satellite cells. Therefore the mechanistic basis for this stimulation will be investigated, and the ability of EGF to restore the regenerative program of dystrophin-deficient satellite cells will be evaluated. These experiments will provide proof-of- concept that modulation of the mechanisms that regulate polarity may be amenable to apply as a therapeutic intervention for DMD. In conclusion, we have discovered a novel role for dystrophin in regulating muscle stem cell polarity. Our proposed experiments will elucidate the mechanisms regulating polarity in stem cells and provide important new insights into the molecular pathobiology contributing to the disease progression of DMD."
"9565063","Promising new tools for HIV prevention and treatment have stimulated global initiatives to ?End the HIV Epidemic? and reach the ?End of AIDS;? however, significant challenges to ending the global HIV epidemic remain. Biomedical advances for prevention and treatment will not reach their full potential without rigorous behavioral and social science research to optimize uptake, adherence, and equitable and effective implementation and scale-up. Thus, we propose a renewed HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies that expands on our history of conducting interdisciplinary HIV research and leverages new partnerships to maximize the potential of biomedical advances, addressing their availability and acceptability to the most vulnerable populations. The HIV Center is unique among NIMH AIDS Research Centers (ARCs) in being based in New York City (NYC), a continuing US AIDS epicenter in a state that has the greatest number of people living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, including ethnic/racial minority populations coping with extreme economic, health, and social disparities. In 2014, HIV Center investigators and other academicians, providers, advocates, and policy-makers joined the Office of the Governor of New York State (NYS) to develop a NYS Blueprint for Ending the Epidemic (EtE). The Blueprint provides the HIV Center with the unique opportunity to use our home city and state as a ?laboratory? to study implementation of EtE initiatives and apply lessons learned to US and global epidemics. Thus, in the next five years, the HIV Center will be guided by the theme, The Science of Ending the HIV/AIDS Epidemic (EtE): Efficacy to Effectiveness at Scale, and its emphasis on implementation research and research at the intersection of behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences.  The HIV Center brings together a cadre of investigators at the forefront of multiple disciplines to address three Specific Aims: (1) to catalyze intervention and implementation science research necessary to achieve EtE goals; (2) to translate research into culturally and structurally competent practice and policy for maximum public health impact; and (3) to increase the capacity of current and future generations of scientists, service providers, and community and policy leaders to create and implement biomedical, behavioral, social, and structural HIV prevention and treatment interventions to meet EtE goals. Our Cores ensure methodological and theoretical rigor, identify and rapidly respond to new trends in the epidemic, support critical research- practice partnerships, and train new scientists. We complement the Administrative and Development Cores with three Research Cores: (1) Statistics, Assessment, and Data Management (StAD) Core, focused on innovative analytic, assessment, and data management strategies; (2) Bio-Behavioral Core, focused on research at the interface of the biomedical and the behavioral and social sciences; and (3) Implementation Science and Health Outcomes (ISHO) Core focused on effective, sustained, and equitable achievement of HIV prevention and care outcomes at scale."
"9407012","ABSTRACT  The Biological Models, Biostatistics, Molecular Pathology and Microscopy Core, Core Component B, is  significantly improved in response to the critiques. A new senior Core Director, Brett Bouma, who is a  Professor at Harvard and an expert in microscopy, will lead the Core. This Core integrates novel biological  models with newly developed biochemical and imaging assay platforms to enable the development of the  treatments envisioned in the Program Projects. This Core will also coordinate physically decentralized but  centrally communicating biostatistics and pathological services to support experimental design and the  interpretation of preclinical results. The biostatistics and pathology personnel, who are located at each site  to maintain close contact with each principal investigator, are now specified in the revised submission. The  objective of Core B is to provide a service and research platform to increase the efficiency of microscopy,  biostatistics and pathology techniques used by all four Program Projects. In addition, another aim of Core B  is to collaborate with Projects to develop new technologies. Thus, the Core will also have a research and  development component to provide novel cancer models and tumor imaging technologies for the  advancement of the Program Projects. For instance, once the erlotinib containing TLNCs have been  developed in Project 3, Core B will fabricate these to transfer this technology for use in Project 1. Overall,  the Program Projects will leverage several new biomarker and treatment response quantification methods  developed and validated during the previous funding cycle.  RELEVANCE  Core B provides biological models, biostatistics, molecular pathology and microscopy support that are needed  for the projects to be maximally successful in optimizing photodynamic-based combination therapies of cancer.  The core integrates advanced biological models of skin and pancreatic cancer with newly developed  biochemical and imaging assay platforms to enable the rational-design of novel combination therapies for  optimal inhibition of cancer cell survival and metastasis."
"9666114","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cutaneous melanoma represents a significant and growing public health burden in the USA. This extremely deadly disease arises as a result of the acquisition of a series of genetic mutations in the melanocytes located in the bottom layer of the skin's epidermis. Although solar UV radiation is the primary cause of cutaneous melanoma, how UV causes the melanomagenesis mutations is poorly understood. Indeed, UV signature mutations, which are primarily caused by cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) directly induced by UV, are common in some mutated genes implicated in cutaneous melanoma. However, the UV signature mutations account for less than 10% of all melanomagenesis mutations. Therefore, DNA lesions indirectly induced by UV, such as the varieties of oxidative lesions and N-methylpurines (NMPs), and/or those induced by other as-yet-unidentified DNA damaging agents may be responsible for the majority of the melanomagenesis mutations. Our long term goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the etiological causes of melanomagenesis mutations and how DNA damage and repair are implicated in the mutagenesis process.  Systematic nucleotide-level mapping of induction and repair of diverse types of DNA lesions in human melanocytes can offer invaluable insights into the causes of the melanomagenesis mutations. The major roadblock to this task is that all currently available methods for DNA damage and repair mapping lack the resolution, sensitivity and/or throughput.  This proposal contains two specific aims. In aim 1, we will develop a novel extremely sensitive method for high-throughput nucleotide-level mapping of DNA damage and repair in living human cells. The next- generation DNA sequencing technologies will be utilized for the development of the novel method. In aim 2, we will map DNA damage induction and repair related to melanomagenesis mutations in human melanocytes. The induction and repair of various types of DNA lesions, including CPDs, oxidative lesions and NMPs, will be mapped in melanocytes from people of different skin types. The genomic regions we plan to map include the sites of melanomagenesis mutations and their neighboring sequences. The correlations of the DNA damage induction and repair events with the site-specific melanomagenesis mutations will be systematically assessed. The tendencies of the identified lesions to form the site-specific mutations will be further confirmed by using a technique that can detect a single mutation among millions or billions of wild type DNA molecules."
"9412464","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alkenes are found in a great number of naturally occurring molecules and are employed in some of the most widely used transformations. Processes that allow access to Z or E isomeric forms of olefins efficiently, reliably, with high selectivity and cost- effectively are therefore of great importance to chemistry, biology and medicine. Especially valuable are the catalytic procedures that form alkenes stereoselectively.  The proposed studies focus on the design, synthesis and development of molybdenum- and tungsten-based catalysts that can be utilized to facilitate one of the most powerful methods in chemical synthesis: olefin metathesis. A variety of concepts, originally conceived in these laboratories, will be used to introduce the needed new catalysts. The goal is to achieve furnish reactivity and/or selectivity levels that remain entirely out of reach and will have a lasting impat on drug discovery and development.  Catalytic methods will be put forth that allow access to a wide range of linear Z- a,b-unsaturated esters and amides, as well as various dienoates. Such entities reside in a myriad of biologically active molecules, and are among the most versatile functional units in chemical synthesis. One of the most critical objectives of the proposed investigations will be the development of efficient catalytic processes that will generate Z-alkeny chloride, bromide, and iodide compounds. These are, again, among the most important and widely used entities in chemistry (e.g., substrates for catalytic cross- coupling); moreover, the ability to incorporate F atoms within organic molecules site- and stereoselectively will be crucial to future drug development. The first examples of catalytically E-selective olefin metathesis reactions will be designed; these processes will deliver valuable E-alkenyl halides. Finally, the first cases of stereoslective catalytic cross-metathesis reactions that generate high-energy trisubstituted alkenes will be introduced. The special utility of the new concepts, catalysts and protocols will be underscored through applications to concise syntheses of biologically significant molecules such as anti-inflammatory agent coriolic acid methyl ester, antiproliferative agent hexachlorosulfolipid as well as alkenyl halide derivatives of dopamine receptor antagonist cabergoline, caspase 3 activator PAC-1, and HMG-C0A reductase swertiamarin."
"9417002","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in the outer retina are highly vulnerable to degenerative eye disease, but recent advances in optogenetics offer the possibility of restoring vision after loss of photoreceptor function.  Ths approach has been demonstrated already in the mouse.  This project will deploy a monkey model to explore the feasibility of a retinal prosthetic that bypasses degenerated photoreceptors by using optogenetic methods to make retinal ganglion cells light-sensitive.  The monkey model is needed because the monkey has a fovea and human-like visual perception.  To establish a monkey model of retinal degeneration, we will use phototoxicity to selectively destroy photoreceptors in localized retinal areas following exposure to bright light.  We will then attempt to restore light sensitivity by transducing ganglion cells with an intravitreal injection of a vira vector designed to express channelrhodopsin.  We will evaluate both the effectiveness of the light exposure in destroying photoreceptor function and the effectiveness of the optogenetic prosthesis in restoring function with two methods.  First, we will measure the light responses of ganglion cells with a genetically encoded calcium indicator, imaged in the living eye with adaptive optics.  The method will allow us to track ganglion cell function repeatedly over many weeks in the same monkey.  Second, we will measure the visual effectiveness of the optogenetic prosthetic with visual psychophysical tasks.  If these experiments are successful, they will clarify the photosensitivity, dynamic range, and information capacity of an optogenetic prosthetic applied to the primate fovea."
"9494299","Project Summary/Abstract High Speed Detector for LCLS Project Summary/Abstract This proposal aims to bring revolutionary next generation x-ray detector technology to the field of X-ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) based structural biology. X-ray FELs produce extremely short pulses of x-rays which can be exploited to obtain unique information about the structure and the dynamics of biological systems. These short bursts of x- rays allow data to be collected prior to the onset of radiation damage, allowing higher resolution structural information to be obtained compared to more traditional measurements. Additionally, the ultrashort pulses lend themselves naturally to the study of fast dynamics. Combined with data collection under ambient conditions, recently developed X-ray FEL methods of femtosecond crystallography provide unique capabilities to study biological dynamics under physiologically relevant conditions with high spatial and temporal resolution. Even though the fields of femtosecond crystallography and imaging using FEL sources are still fairly young, the detector technology used since the start of operations of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS ) is already outdated and in great need of modernization. A large world- wide effort to develop new detector technology has produced paradigm-changing capabilities that are now available for scientific use. High dynamic range, fast (>2 kHz) detectors with single photon sensitivity and very low noise are now available. Such detectors are specifically designed for the ultrashort pulses from X-ray FELs and can maximize the information collected from the single shots necessary for data collection prior to the onset of radiation damage. This proposal is to purchase a recently available Jungfrau 4M detector which will surpass by more than a factor of ten the repetition rate and the dynamic range of the detector currently used for serial femtosecond crystallography at LCLS, while reducing the noise level. This will greatly improve the performance of LCLS femtosecond crystallography, allowing more access to the facility by providing higher quality data faster. It will also enable fundamentally new capabilities by allowing ever more challenging biological problems to be solved at LCLS, with for example smaller crystals and help make de novo phasing more accessible for the discovery of novel structures. This detector will keep LCLS at the forefront of X-ray FEL biology by continuing to provide a world-leading tool for solving uniquely challenging biological problems that conventional methods cannot solve. This will benefit important areas of research such as metallo-enzymes, membrane proteins, GPCRs and large protein complexes, as well as generally provide more broadly accessible capabilities to study the dynamics of biomolecules. 1"

One of the major aspirations of the Program is to  create an ethos for maximal integration of the components to better serve this PPG, the field of  PDT, cancer research, and the community at large. To this end, the PIs have brought together a  team of new and existing scientists and physicians who are already collaborating  enthusiastically. In addition to the two broad functions of Scientific and Administrative  coordination, the renewal application adds the goals of career development, intellectual property  (IP) development, and data sharing to this Core. The scientific coordination will be maintained  through a variety of mechanisms that will include regular intra- and inter- Project/Core meetings.  This Core will: a) perform monthly reviews and identify obstacles; b) coordinate meetings with  selected consultants and key personnel; c) organize and follow up on action plans, and lastly d)  achieve additional scientific enhancement via inviting speakers with larger perspective on  cancer biology relevant to the Program, but not directly in the area of PDT. Special care will  need to be taken to ensure that where appropriate, technologies get IP protection and find  optimal development partners consistent with one of the goals of the NIH Roadmap for private-  public partnerships. The career advancement goal captures the Core Leaders' strengths at their  respective institutions and will intentionally encourage and recruit promising young investigators  to scientific education and PDT, and ultimately help with placement of appropriate individuals at  high caliber scientific institutions. The Core will also be responsible for data sharing via its  website, part of which will be publicly accessible and interactive. The scientific and  administrative coordination managed by this administrative core is crucial to ensure efficient  execution of the Program, enabling the many different components to perform optimally.

"9543171","Abstract Mice with a skeletal muscle (SkM)-specific decrease in the small 12 kDa FK506 binding protein, FKBP12, (FKD mice) display improved endurance, insulin-mediated glucose clearance, and bone mineral density, as well as decreased body fat and resistance to weight gain on a high fat diet. Low doses of rapamycin and SLF (synthetic ligand for FKBP12) that displace FKBP12 from its binding partners mimic the effects of FKBP12 deficiency in SkM, suggesting these drugs have potential as interventions to improve muscle function and metabolism. The primary target of FKBP12 in SkM is the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release channel, RyR1, which controls the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores during excitation-contraction coupling (ECC). Partial removal of FKBP12 from RyR1 (genetically or by treatment with low doses of rapamycin or SLF) increases both the amplitude of the myoplasmic Ca2+ transient and Ca2+ influx into the muscle fiber during repetitive stimulation. Both enhanced SR Ca2+ release and increased Ca2+ influx associated with partial removal of FKBP12 from RyR1 are blocked by inhibitors of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). However, the mechanisms by which increases in Ca2+ release and influx result in improved muscle function and metabolism remain unknown. We hypothesize the existence of a tunable feedback loop that functionally couples ECC, SOCE, and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake to modulate muscle function and metabolism. The specific aims of this application are to: A1. Define the roles of FKBP12 and RyR1 phosphorylation in regulating the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient during repetitive stimulation and improving SkM performance and metabolism. 2. Define the feedback loop that enhances Ca2+ store refilling and ATP production to sustain the improved muscle performance and metabolism in FKBP12 deficient mice. 3. Evaluate the therapeutic potential of SLF to improve muscle function and metabolism. Our long-term goal is to develop interventions to improve muscle function in people who cannot perform strenuous exercise due to age, muscle disease, obesity and/or have type II diabetes."
"9431219","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gap junctions are integral membrane proteins that enable the direct cytoplasmic exchange of ions and low-molecular-mass metabolites between adjacent cells. They provide a pathway for propagating and/or amplifying the signal transduction cascades triggered by cytokines, growth factors, and other cell signaling molecules involved in growth regulation and development. Dysfunctional intercellular communication via gap junctions has been implicated in causing many human diseases. The objective of this project is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to identify the key intrinsic regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for Cx43 and Cx45 function. The central hypothesis is that unique intermolecular interactions within the divergent CT domain of Cxs affect gap junction regulation. More specifically, we hypothesize that in the failing heart, Cx43CT phosphorylation alters protein partner interactions leading to remodeling of Cx43 from the intercalated disc, and that dimerization of Cx45 CTs is, in part, responsible for the channel properties of Cx45 that distinguish it from Cx43 and for the dominant-negative effect of Cx45 in heteromeric channels with Cx43. It is well-known that the CT domains of Cxs are key regulators of channel properties, and that dimerization of cytosolic domains are key regulators of ion channels. This proposal is significant because discovery of how interactions mediated by the CT domain can be modulated would open the door to strategies to ameliorate the pathological effects of altered Cx regulation in the failing heart. The following Specific Aims are proposed to investigate this concept: 1) Define how tyrosine kinases down regulate Cx43 gap junction intercellular communication, 2) Determine how Cx43 phosphorylation alters protein partner interactions, and 3) Identify the importance and mechanism of Cx45CT dimerization."
"9598054","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lethal bone metastasis frequently develops in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Critically, the biology of this conditio remains uncertain. Our currently funded Program Project Grant (PPG) focuses on characterizing selected soluble factors, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) secreted by cancer cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment, to develop biomarkers to predict PC progression and treatment response. Our progress during the current funding period includes several patents and the development of multiple antibodies recognizing HSPG fragments for potential commercialization as diagnostic/ prognostic biomarkers. We also humanized a therapeutic antibody against ?2-microglobulin for clinical translation to treat PC bone metastasis. In this competitive renewal application, our long-term redefined goal is to pursue new concepts in the tumor microenvironment that redirect tumor cells toward a metastatic phenotype. These innovations include the discoveries that (1) metastasis can be coordinated by Metastasis Initiating Cells (MICs) (Project 1: Chung), (2) the HSPG perlecan and its degradative products are critical mediators of PC metastasis (Project 2: Farach-Carson); (3) cells with megakaryocyte and/or osteomimetic (MO-mimicry) properties reside in primary tumors and can be altered by stromal factors to metastasize to bone (Project 3: Bhowmick); and (4) epigenetic programming of the PC genome can affect cholesterol and sterol metabolism in a manner that promotes metastasis (Project 4: Freeman). To test these concepts, we will use approaches and resources unique to our team. We showed that MICs can reprogram non-metastatic dormant cells through a feed-forward action involving a RANK-mediated signaling network, provoking them to participate in bone colonization. This novel concept is supported by substantial data from animal models and a unique population of hormone-naïve PC patients with bone metastasis and pathologic specimens collected from patients with known overall survival. We will pursue the underlying biology of how circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) (Project 1- Chung), and endothelial and inflammatory cells (Project 2), are recruited to participate in the metastatic cascade. We propose to develop biomarkers to predict which patients will switch from indolent to aggressive disease. Our long range objectives will be achieved by identifying signaling pathways converging on critical nodes that can be targeted with drugs. Our team has developed a range of state-of-the-art methods and tools, including single cell methods of tumor cell isolation using NanoVelcro microfluidics, whole genome sequencing, quantitative IHC by multiplex quantum dot labeling (mQDL), ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses. We have demonstrated success in 3D culture of human DTCs, tissue recombinants comprised of engineered human and murine cells, and reliable models of human PC bone and soft tissue metastases."
"9441827","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An aneurysm is an abnormal dilation of an artery that, if left untreated, can lead to fatal tear or rupture. TGF? signaling upregulation is observed in aortic tissue from patients affected by hereditary aneurysm disorders, such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), that are caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding positive regulators of the TGF? pathway. These paradoxical findings have caused considerable controversy and have called into question the use of TGF? antagonists as therapy for these disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that cause TGF? signaling overdrive in LDS. We propose to test a non-cell autonomous mechanism based on the observation that LDS mutations in either of the two genes that encode TGF? receptor subunits have discordant effects on the signaling capacity of aortic cell types that are adjacent in the vessel wall but derived from different embryonic progenitors. Specifically, these mutations leave high responder cells such as cardiac neural crest-derived vascular smooth muscle cells (CNC-VSMCs) relatively unaffected, while they impair the TGF? response of more vulnerable low responder cells, such as second heart field-derived VSMCs (SHF-VSMCs). The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that compensatory events aimed at restoring normal signaling in low responder cells, such as upregulation of TGF? ligand expression, will induce TGF? signaling overdrive in high responder cells, ultimately culminating in the development of aneurysm. In order to test this hypothesis, I will work with my primary mentor, Dr. Dietz, an expert on aneurysm pathogenesis, and with my co-mentor, Dr. Van Eyk, an expert in clinical proteomics applications, to address the first two aims. In Aim1, I will define the cellular mediators of TGF? paracrine overdrive by analyzing the TGF? response of control and LDS SHF-VSMCs and CNC-VSMCs, and the repertoire of paracrine factors secreted by these cells both in vivo and in vitro. In Aim 2, I will functionally test the TGF? paracrine overdrive model by pharmacological and genetic manipulations. Specifically, I will assess whether global TGF? antagonism or cellspecific reduction of TGF? signaling in high responder cells, but not low responder cells, ameliorates aneurysm progression in LDS mice. During this phase of the award I will become proficient in the field of proteomics and bioinformatics by working with Dr. Van Eyk's lab and by participating in formal coursework. The new skills, techniques, and knowledge that I will gain will foster my transition to the R00 phase, in which I will independentl address Aim 3 and Aim 4. In Aim 3 I propose to identify the molecular determinants of lineagespecific TGF? responses by using proteomics-based techniques and conventional biochemical methods to analyze, both in vitro and in vivo, the differential expression and/or post-translational modifications of modulators of TGF? signaling in high responder and low responder cells. In Aim 4, I intend to elucidate the contribution of CD45+ immune cells to TGF? signaling paracrine overdrive. I will characterize the phenotype of the CD45+ immune cells infiltrate that is present at the site of aneurysm in LDS mouse models and assess whether TGF? ligand secreted by these cells contributes to exacerbation of pathology. I am confident that the training and career development plan described in this proposal will enable me to elucidate the mechanisms of excessive TGF? signaling in LDS and will provide critical information for the understanding of cell-type specific TGF?-responses. The studies described in this proposal have the potential to increase our understanding of other TGF?-related disorders, such as fibrosis and cancer, in which signaling imbalances between interacting cell-types may drive pathology."

"9252219","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fractures account for 25% of all musculoskeletal injuries in the U.S., leading to 8 million treatment visits per year and 60 million lost work days. Rates of healing complication (delayed or non-union) range from 1-10%, affecting more than 100,000 patients annually. Stress fractures are a repetitive use injury affecting 500,000 people each year, mostly athletes and military recruits. Recently, a rare but devastating type of stress fracture - the atypical femur fracture - has been described, linked to bisphosphonate treatment. Although the methods by which full fractures and stress fractures heal are distinct, in both cases the key to achieving a functional repair is robust, periosteal bone formation (osteogenesis). The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanobiological pathways that regulate osteogenesis in the context of bone repair of the adult skeleton. Angiogenesis and inflammation are two processes integral to osteogenesis during bone repair, and recent evidence from the past funding period suggests that the osteocyte may play a role in initiating or regulating these processes. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the osteocyte contributes angiogenic and inflammatory factors critical to bone repair. Murine models for full fracture (closed, stabilizd femoral shaft fracture) and stress fracture (ulnar fatigue loading) will be used to create reproducible bone injuries. Histology, microCT and qPCR gene expression will be used to assess inflammatory, angiogenic and osteogenic outcomes. In Aim 1, the role of the prototypic pro-angiogenic factor VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor) will be examined in different cell types (osteocyte, osteoblast, endothelial cell) using Cre-loxP methods. The recent availability of inducible Cre drivers makes this aim feasible in adult mice. In Aim 2, the role of factors classically related to inflammation, but also relevant to vascular responses and angiogenesis, will be evaluated. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are expressed by bone cells and immune cells. In the past funding period iNOS was shown to mediate increased blood flow and osteogenesis after stress fracture. Using Cre-loxP methods and radiation chimera, the relative importance of osteocytes and immune cells in producing these two factors will be examined. In summary, the project will determine whether the osteocyte, already recognized as a master regulator of bone homeostasis and remodeling, plays an important role in bone repair. Better understanding of endogenous repair mechanisms may inform future treatment strategies to augment bone healing."
"9418020","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NFATc1, NF?B, cFOS, PU.1/SPI1 and MITF are transcription factors (TFs) essential for osteoclast differentiation from myeloid precursors. However, large gaps still remain in our understanding of the interplay between these TFs and how this interplay contributes to osteoclast differentiation and function. Importantly, critical questions about how the dynamics of TF regulation contributes to clinical outcome of human bone related diseases are unresolved. During the last cycle of this grant we used newly available functional genomic approaches and new bioinformatics approaches to develop a hierarchical network model that explains the interactions between these factors and their relative roles in osteoclast differentiation. Based on this model our overriding hypothesis is that PU.1 and MITF are at the apex of an osteoclast transcription factor network in osteoclasts and their myeloid precursors that initiates and maintains the differentiated state in response to signals received from the local microenvironment. In the current proposal, we aim to test this model using both in vivo and in vitro experiments and importantly to extend these studies into normal human osteoclasts and circulating osteoclast precursors from rheumatoid arthritis patients. Further we will test the importance of this network and associated factors in a preclinical mouse model for rheumatoid arthritis, using approaches that genetically target Pu.1 or use small molecule inhibitors to target PU.1/MITF-dependent epigenetic changes in pre-osteoclasts. By combining our efforts and expertise, our multidisciplinary team will focus on the task of understanding the mechanisms that govern osteoclast differentiation and function, and the relevance of these factors in human osteoclasts."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this SBIR project is to develop a minimally intrusive, highly-sensitive risk-stratification tool to determine the need for invasive pancreatic cancer (PC) screening. PC is the 4th leading cause of cancer deaths in the US. While early stage disease is generally curable, the vast majority of patients are diagnosed in advanced, unresectable stages due in large part to the lack of a suitable candidate screening technology. Unfortunately, all current screening modalities (ERCP or EUS) suffer from a very high false positive rate, high cost, invasiveness, and risk of serious complications. This underlines the urgent need for developing an effective test that targets PCat an early stage. The present project is based on a novel biophotonics technology that is exclusively licensed to NanoCytomics by Northwestern Univ., Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy ('nanocytology'), that has been shown to sense and quantify nanoscale early-stage tumorigenic alterations within histologically normal- appearing cells. PWS uses the phenomenon of field carcinogenesis, the concept that the genetic/epigenetic alterations that lead to PC are also reflected in endoscopically normal periampullary duodenal mucosa either through shared risk factors or secreted factors (cytokines etc) from the pancreatic juice. Although the duodenal cells in PC patients appear endoscopically and microscopically normal, there are profound epigenetic alterations (e.g. methylation, microRNA etc.) whose nanoscale corollary (e.g., high-order chromatin) are detectable by partial PWS. The detection of nanoscale structural alterations of the fertile tumorigenic field may allow to risk-stratify patients with early-stage cancers or precancerous lesions located anywhere in duodenum. Thus, our preliminary data showed that the PWS-detectable nano-morphological alterations of periampullary duodenal cells are a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for PC. To perform the academic to commercial transition and establish duodenal nanocytology as a commercially-viable, minimally-intrusive, and highly-sensitive pre-screen for PC, several steps must be completed. In the present Phase I SBIR project, standard operating procedures (SOP) that are optimized for stability, reliability and diagnostic potential will be developed and validated. The future steps of this project will include refinement and optimization of the PWS markers in Phase II (thus enhancing its diagnostic power), followed by a multi-center clinical trial critical for the eventual regulatory approval. We envision that PWS analysis of cells brushed from the periampullary duodenal mucosa of high-risk patients (new onset diabetics, family history, chronic pancreatitis, etc.) as well as those undergoing EGD for other indications will serve as a gauge of risk/probability and can be used to risk stratify and hence tailor screening/surveillance decisions thus identifying the subset of patients who may benefit from further screening (such as a pancreatic CT/MRI or EUS/ERCP). In the long term, duodenal PWS can be combined with the existing upper GI screening by ultrathin EGD, thus allowing for a pan-upper GI cancer screening."
"9407013","ABSTRACT Core C    Core C has both research and service goals, with the overall theme of developing new and useful imaging and  dosimetry approaches to help optimize PDT, both for experimental protocols as well as clinical trials. The systems used  by each project vary considerably, yet the file systems, data analysis, planning and dosimetry concepts can be  centralized and inter-project communication in this area can significantly enhance the quality of research. The core is  subdivided into four distinct aims, including (i) developing clinically viable tools for structural and functional imaging as  well as dosimetry; (ii) providing baseline data for tumor models and imaging in vivo; (iii) methods for quantitative  molecular imaging in vivo; and (iv) technology and methodology translation and adoption. These aims all work with the  projects to ensure that developments from one project may assist in another, and that methods, doses, image files, and  developed software gets used to the highest potential. The core will assist Projects 1 and 2 in establishing truly useful  dosimetry tools customized for the clinical trials. The variance of PS concentration will be studied in both skin and  pancreatic cancer models. Quantification of key receptor changes in vivo will be developed. Specialized  instrumentation and expertise exists across all four centers, with a large locus of tools and equipment in the MGH &  Dartmouth sites, and this will be coordinated, scheduled and training provided through quarterly planned  organizational meetings. Technical experts exist at each center though, and these frequent meetings coordinated by  the core help to ensure that expertise and resources are utlized to maximum benfit. Travel between sites is planned  judiciously to maximize cost/benefit, especially when training or prototyping measurements or trials, and internet  conferences are utilized frequently. The complexity of technologies used is high, and sharing expertise about these  significantly benefits the overall program participants. The complex issue of technology transfer is incorporated, as we  have mulitiple partners in companies, as well as experienced technology transfer offices of each institution, and the  CIMIT center at MGH. Coordination of this with high level planning meetings is central to ensuring that technologies  and methodologies are translated into the program or out of the program into industry use.    RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Core C provides the medical imaging, dosimetry, technology transfer expertise that is needed for the projects to be  maximally successful. Since PDT is a technology-based intervention which requires imaging and analysis of therapeutic  outcome, the core will help lead our efforts in excellence within this area. Superior treatment outcomes in the  pancrease and skin cancer clinical trials will be a result"
"9516435","PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a major cause of premature mortality due to its associated co-morbidities such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Two-thirds of adults in the United States are overweight, adding immense costs to the healthcare system. Although once considered to be a social issue of overindulgence, modern science has revealed a profound effect of genetics on body weight. Rare monogenetic forms of obesity in humans and animal models have revealed that the regulation of energy balance is complex, involving numerous intertwined signaling pathways.  Both Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Alström syndrome (ALMS) are genetic disorders that present with increases in eating and obesity. These rare syndromes are examples of ciliopathies, a class of genetic disorders that have cilia dysfunction as their etiological basis. Primary cilia are small, solitary, microtubule based cellular appendages that were long thought to be vestigial organelles. Thus, it was surprising that their dysfunction was associated with obesity in both humans and animal models. Disruption of cilia specifically within the brain of mice results in hyperphagia associated obesity. Recent work has implicated cilia or their associated proteins in coordinating leptin signaling, although this remains controversial and unclear. It has also recently been shown that several G-protein coupled receptors preferentially localize to the cilia of neurons. How these ciliary receptors and signaling pathways may impact feeding behavior and obesity also remains unclear. The goal of this project is to determine if altered signaling through a specific ciliary receptor that is known to have a role in feeding behavior, melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1, contributes to the obesity phenotype. A strong understanding of the connection between cilia and obesity could open new therapeutic approaches to address one of the most clinically important issues impacting the health of the American populace."
"9480883","Project Summary/Abstract  This project will develop and implement a training program in neurotherapeutics discovery and development for faculty members and advanced postdoctoral fellows, centered around a 3½-day short course that will provide the trainees with the various knowledge elements required to discover and advance a neurotherapeutic agent to IND. Following the short course, the training program will continue for a two-year period in which students will have individualized mentoring and assessment. The training, which is designed to be applicable to diverse diseases of the nervous system, will equip students with a broad understanding of the various component steps in the neurotherapeutics drug discovery and development process. Students will learn how to identify a good drug discovery target; how to construct an assay; the elements of medicinal chemistry; how to conduct animal efficacy testing; the principles of ADME studies, safety testing, and formulation; the principles of experimental medicine and biomarkers; the steps required to prepare an IND document and the principles for interacting with the FDA; the principles of intellectual property as they relate to neurotherapeutics discovery and development; and how to seek funding for academic drug discovery research. They will also receive training in responsible conduct of research. Students will be equipped with the skills to develop and coordinate an entire drug discovery and development effort, and to work collaboratively with experts in each of the component areas. The training will combine didactic lectures with active engagement activities in which the students will be challenged to utilize the lecture material to work through their own drug discovery project plan with the guidance of the area experts. The 3½-day short course (followed by two-years of mentorship and assessment) will be offered annually, a total of five times."

"9557949","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT An effective HIV-1 vaccine will likely require the elicitation of humoral immunity in vaccine recipients. Vaccination studies have shown proof-of-concept that pre-existing antibodies may have the potential to prevent infection or slow disease progression upon HIV-1 or SIV exposure. Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is a natural setting in which the characteristics of protective pre-existing antibodies can be studied. HIV-positive mothers passively transfer HIV-specific IgG to their infants in utero, and these antibodies remain in infant circulation for 6 months or more, a key period of breastfeeding exposure to HIV-1. Less than half of infants born to HIV-positive mothers acquire HIV-1 through MTCT whereas the majority remain uninfected, even without antiretroviral therapy. This proposal addresses the hypothesis that pre-existing passively-transferred maternal antibodies present in infant circulation protect the infant from MTCT of HIV-1. Specifically, this proposal focuses on the hypothesis that antibodies from non-transmitting mothers target specific epitopes that confer their infants with protection from MTCT of HIV-1. It was recently reported that passively-transferred antibodies that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC; a mechanism of killing infected cells) was associated with reduced risk of infant mortality among infected infants and with a trend toward protection from MTCT of HIV-1. This study used a unique cohort of samples from the Nairobi Breastfeeding Clinical Trial (NBT) in Kenya, which was conducted from 1992-1998 before antiretroviral therapy was the standard of care. Because pre-existing passively-transferred antibodies have been shown to play a role in infant outcomes in this cohort, this cohort is ideal for in-depth investigation of the characteristics of beneficial passively-transferred antibodies. In the first part of this proposal, antibody binding to a panel of HIV-1 antigens will be measured, and epitopes of antibodies from non-transmitting and transmitting mother-infant pairs will be compared to determine whether targeting certain epitopes is associated with reduced risk of MTCT. Because ADCC was shown to be associated with improved infant outcome, the second part of this proposal will investigate the epitopes of these ADCC-mediating antibodies. A competition assay will be used to test whether ADCC-mediating antibodies from non-transmitting mother-infant pairs target different known ADCC epitopes compared to transmitting pairs. The last part of this proposal will finely map epitopes of monoclonal ADCC-mediating antibodies isolated from singly-sorted B cells from a non-transmitting mother who had high viral load, and thus was at high risk for transmitting HIV-1 to her infant. The goal of finely mapping epitopes of ADCC-mediating antibodies from a high risk non-transmitting mother is to characterize protective ADCC-mediating antibodies in detail. Overall, these studies will shed light on epitopes of antibodies capable of providing protection from HIV-1 infection, which will help inform for future vaccine design, passive vaccination strategies, antibody-based therapy."
"9444466","Project 4 Summary Development of a safe and efficacious vaccine that prevents HIV infection is still an unmet need. We have demonstrated that a Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-vectored vaccine expressing SIV antigens elicits high frequency, broadly distributed, effector-memory, SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that mediate complete (?control and clear?) protection of 50-60% of vaccinated RM against repeated mucosal challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239. Recent studies have demonstrated that only RhCMV vectors lacking the RhCMV homologs of the HCMV UL128 and UL130 genes are able to mediate this remarkable efficacy, despite similar immunogenicity of the UL128/UL130-intact vectors in terms of magnitude, distribution and functional differentiation. We further determined that the UL128/UL130-deletion had a major effect on the epitope targeting of the RhCMV vector-elicited CD8+ T cells: whereas the CD8+ T cells elicited by UL128/UL130-intact RhCMV vectors are conventionally MHC-Ia-restricted, the CD8+ T cells elicited by UL128/UL130-deleted RhCMV vectors are entirely restricted by either MHC-II or non-classical MHC-E. We have also determined that the MHC-II- and MHC-E-restricted components of the protective immune responses are independently regulated, and thus separable. Since a protective HCMV/HIV vectored vaccine will almost certainly need to induce unconventional T cell responses in people in order to mediate protection, effective clinical translation of our pre-clinical findings will depend upon the identification of the protective component of the unconventional responses (Project 1), and the delineation of the virologic mechanisms by which RhCMV elicits these efficacious responses (Projects 2-4). We have determined that UL128 and UL130 contribute to unconventional response programming by at least 2 different mechanisms: an effect on vector tropism mediated by the contribution of both UL128 and UL130 to the pentameric receptor complex (PRC) and a PRC-independent mechanism by which either UL128 or UL130 can inhibit MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell response priming in myeloid-derived cells. The effect of tropism on CMV vector response programming is addressed in Project 2. In Project 4 we first seek to identify the specific motifs in the UL128 and UL130 proteins which block MHC-E- restricted CD8+ T cell priming with the goal of mutating these regions to abrogate their MHC-E-response inhibition while retaining PRC function. Since MHC-E-restricted response priming is myeloid cell-dependent, whereas MHC-II responses are disfavored by vector infection of myeloid cells, this should result in a vector that preferentially elicits MHC-E-restricted responses. Second, since HCMV lacking UL128 and UL130 fails to elicit unconventional T cell responses in RM, its possible that HCMV encodes other genes that block unconventional CD8+ T cell responses. Therefore, utilizing a deletion strategy we will ascertain whether any non-essential HCMV genes have this activity. Finally, utilizing the data from Projects 2-4, Project 4 will construct the 2nd generation ?response and safety? optimized HCMV/HIV vector for manufacture and clinical testing in Project 5.  "
"9475074","Project Summary Melanoma, a cancer that can be surgically cured when detected early, can be difficult to distinguish from common, benign pigmented spots (nevi) that develop on human skin, a situation that leads to the unnecessary excision of benign nevi and the failure to detect some evolving melanomas. Intriguingly, the most frequent oncogenic mutation in melanoma?activation of BRAF?is also the cause of most nevi. Yet, unlike melanoma, nevi spontaneously growth-arrest. The explanation has been attributed to ?oncogene-induced senescence?, but a variety of observations indicate that what holds nevi in check is not cell-autonomous senescence, but rather reversible interactions among nevus cells, and between those cells and their environment. Such interactions resemble the intra-lineage feedback mechanisms used by many normal tissues to achieve growth control and size homeostasis. Using an inducible Braf-mutant mouse model, we recently made the observation that nevi are not only composed of pigmented cells but also a novel melanocyte population that forms a ?veil? around the pigmented cells, consistent with the existence of lineage relationships that could underlie such a feedback strategy. In this project, we will investigate the role of these cell types in mouse models that produce both nevi and melanoma, seeking to identify both the nature of growth control and the means by which melanoma cells escape from it. We will integrate mathematical modeling to develop hypotheses that can explain the spatiotemporal dynamics and spatial statistics of nevus and melanoma development in these models, including potential bifurcations that account for the development of both nevi and melanoma in the same mouse. We will use time-course single cell RNA-sequencing to identify potential positive and negative feedback regulators that drive such models, and will carry out experiments to test model-based predictions concerning the roles that such molecules play. Finally, we will investigate the phenomenon of spontaneous regression, which occurs with both mouse and human nevi, for clues into how the immune system efficiently recognizes melanocyte overgrowth. Such information will be useful in developing new prevention and therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease."
"9457448","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optic neuropathies damage retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons of the optic nerve, resulting in permanent visual deficits. Substantial progress has been made in our ability to promote axon regeneration following axonal injury, but regeneration remains limited to a small number of RGCs. RGCs are a heterogeneous population, with more than 30 described subtypes. Through the use of transgenic mouse lines it has been determined that an RGC's subtype may predict its regenerative capacity. The molecular mechanisms that regulate subtype dependent differences in regenerative capacity have just started to be identified. The goal of this proposal is to determine: i) whether distinct subtypes of RGC display different responses to axonal injury, and ii) the transcriptional differences that correlate with regenerative capacity. In Aim 1, I will use transgenic mouse lines to investigate how altering light sensitivity affects RGC regeneration. In Aim 2, I will investigate how distinct subtypes of RGC respond to injury. This will be determined by immunohistochemical detection of proteins important for regeneration. Finally, in Aim 3 of this study I will identify potential positive and negative regulators of RGC axon regeneration. RGC subtypes with contrasting regenerative capacities will be selected for subsequent RNA-sequencing. Differentially expressed genes will be identified and validated by RT-qPCR. These genes will serve as novel therapeutic targets to enhance the regeneration of all RGCs, a critical step towards restoring lost vision."
"9512119","ABSTRACT The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a new technology that can allow patients to repeatedly measure nucleic acid-based cancer biomarkers from a single drop of blood on a daily basis. This assay is being developed for specific clinical applications to determine drug treatment efficacies, prognosticate survival, and monitor post- treatment intervention by evaluating candidate nucleic acids shed from the tumor into blood of a cancer patient. We are focusing on detecting microRNA due to a very strong correlation with survival that our team has recently identified for patients with metastatic prostate cancer. We hypothesize that by measuring the concentrations of these markers in patients on a frequent basis during the course of therapy, we can precisely adjust therapeutic regimens for individual patients. However, accurately measuring microRNA in blood requires an extremely high limit of detection due to low concentrations, detection over a broad range of concentrations, and high sequence- specificity, attributes that are not currently possible for routine screening of fingerstick blood samples using standard methods of detection, such as PCR. Toward this end, our clinical needs have inspired a new form of assay to measure nucleic acids in blood through direct molecular counting in a microscope. This is now possible because we have developed novel ways to amplify the signals from individual molecules through a series of synergistic technologies, including light-emitting quantum dots, electric field-enhancing photonic crystals, and single-step sequence-specific enzymatic growth of microRNA. We now will combine these technologies to set the stage for measurement of microRNA using low-cost equipment that is already available in clinical diagnostic laboratories to minimize translational barriers to clinical adoption. To achieve these goals, our multi-investigator team has extensive expertise in probes for single-molecule imaging (Andrew Smith), optical detection in low- cost devices (Brian Cunningham), clinical oncology (Manish Kohli), biomarker discovery (Liang Wang), and epidemiology/biostatistics (Rebecca Smith). We will optimize our platform using a combination of synthetic and clinical blood specimens and thoroughly analyze the sequence selectivity of our assay, particularly focusing on microRNA variants, and closely compare our results with those from quantitative PCR assays. By the end of this award period, we expect to have developed the first direct-readout microRNA assay for use in human samples that is compatible with low-cost equipment, optimized the synergistic integration between quantum dots and photonic crystals, and measured, for the first time, the precise (digital) concentrations of microRNA in the blood of 100 subjects, prospectively enrolled and followed over 6 days each during the course of standard of care treatments for which no predictive or prognostic biomarkers currently exist in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. If successful, the outcome of this work will fill a major clinical gap in knowledge of how to match and finely tune treatments to individual molecular profiles."

"9543055","Project Summary ? Abstract Partial support is requested for an international meeting on Meiosis as part of the Gordon Research Conferences (GRC) and the accompanying Meiosis Gordon Research Seminar (GRS). These meetings will be held at Colby- Sawyer College in New London, NH. The GRC is a 4 ½-day meeting taking place June 10-15, 2018 and is preceded by the 1 ½-day GRS meeting taking place June 9-10, 2018. The GRS is a meeting organized by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows that offers ample opportunities for junior researchers to network and discuss the topics that will be covered in more depth during the Meiosis GRC. Meiosis is the specialized cell division program that results in the formation of haploid gametes and is therefore central to sexual reproduction, ensuring both fertility and genetic diversity. The long term goal of the conferences is to understand the fundamental mechanisms that ensure the stabile inheritance of the genome during meiotic cell divisions. The specific aims of the meetings are to: foster innovation, create networks between young and established investigators, rapidly disseminate new and unpublished results, and promote interdisciplinary synergies. The GRC will gather approximately 180 participants, including 53 speakers, to present and discuss cutting-edge, unpublished research. The program comprises 9 plenary sessions that broadly address current issues in meiosis such as: the organization, regulation and functions of chromosome synapsis, the regulation of initiation, progression and distribution of meiotic recombination, new and emerging technologies for assessing the sources of aneuploidy, spindle assembly and regulation of sister chromatid cohesion, epigenetic control of meiotic processes and germline gene expression, cell cycle checkpoints, regulation of chromosome dynamics and chromatin organization during meiosis, and the evolution and natural variation of meiotic processes. Four poster sessions will provide a basis for extended and in-depth critical discussions. The poster sessions are a particularly valuable forum for forging interdisciplinary collaborations and for new investigators to join networks. The GRS will include between 50-60 participants and will have three plenary and two poster sessions. This application has direct relevance to human health. Errors during meiosis have a significant impact on human reproductive health, accounting for more then 30% of all miscarriages, as well as infertility, stillbirths and birth defects such as Down Syndrome. In addition, many of the mechanisms that repair programmed meiotic DNA double-strand breaks also serve to protect mitotically dividing cells from harmful DNA lesions. Therefore, understanding meiosis provides novel insights into genome stability and preventing cancer. This pair of conferences brings together graduate students, postdocs, young investigators and established PIs working on both basic and clinical research at the forefront of the meiosis field with the common goal of innovating and expanding our knowledge in this critical area of reproductive health.!"
"9435150","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes an innovative, low-cost whole-genome sequencing (WGS) test for the genome-wide delineation of structural variation (SV) to capture the full spectrum of pathogenic variation that is currently detected by two lower-resolution methods. Genome-wide SV studies are the ACMG recommended first-tier diagnostic screen for a myriad of congenital anomalies, including autism spectrum disorder. Diagnostic SV screening relies on karyotyping or chromosomal microarray (CMA). Karyotyping can detect balanced chromosomal rearrangements (BCRs) at microscopic resolution but is insensitive to smaller alterations, whereas CMA can detect copy number variants (CNVs) but not BCRs. At present, no validated genome-wide method can identify both BCRs and CMA-resolution CNVs in a single diagnostic test, leaving inevitable blind spots depending on the technology chosen. Moreover, submicroscopic, or `cryptic', BCRs are intractable to all conventional diagnostics and represent one of the last unexplored spaces of genomic variation. We have shown that large-insert WGS, or `jumping' libraries, can delineate both BCRs and CNVs in a research capacity. We have also recently demonstrated its clinical potential by providing an in utero prenatal diagnosis (Talkowski et al., 2012, N Engl J Med). In a paper published back-to-back with our prenatal sequencing, Co-I Wapner and colleagues validated CMA as the preferred method for prenatal diagnostics through an NICHD consortium of 4,340 prenatal samples with both karyotyping and CMA (Wapner et al., 2012, N Engl J Med). Here, we propose to validate jumping library sequencing for routine SV detection in these well-characterized prenatal samples. We will perform a critical validation in Aim 1 to determine the sensitivity of our sequencing method to capture all pathogenic SVs detected by karyotyping and CMA, with the benefit of precise sequence resolution for gene discovery. In Aim 2, we will calibrate the added diagnostic value of cryptic SVs in at least 400 trios from the highest yield diagnostic cohort (ultrasound defects) for which conventional methods failed to detect a causative mutation. Our preliminary data suggest that cryptic SVs account for 5.3-9.4% of pathogenic mutations; an important component of the diagnostic yield that is presently uncharacterized. In Aim 3, we will integrate CMA data from a consortium of academic and commercial diagnostic sites with the exome aggregation project at the Broad Institute, which will collectively represent an amalgamation of >200,000 subjects. We will compare diagnostic yield from conventional criteria to a quantitative risk score based on the convergence of genomics datasets. The final product will be the validation of a single sequencing platform to overcome the limitations of two lower-resolution methods, the determination of clinical yield from a currently uncharacterized class of genomic variation, and the creation of a publicly accessible genome annotation resource. This project could have an immediate and transformative impact on genetic diagnostic practice."
"9378375","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. The 2015 global cancer statistics report indicated an estimated 951,600 new gastric cancer cases and 723,100 deaths occurred in 2012. Several studies have reported frequent association of gastric adenocarcinoma with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. The World Health Organization has classified H. pylori as a class I carcinogen and the main risk factor for gastric cancer. Despite efforts to eradicate H. pylori, infection remains a global health problem with almost half of the world's population infected. Of note, chronic infection with H. pylori persists for several decades before the development of gastric cancer. This latency in the development of gastric cancer and the fact that only 1% of infected individuals develop cancer suggests that epithelial cells have an inherent protective capacity against cellular transformation  by H. pylori. When epithelial cells lose their protective capacity, they become prone to the carcinogenic effects of H. pylori, leading to the development of intestinal metaplasia, gastric dysplasia and progression to cancer. We and others have reported that trefoil factor 1 (TFF1) expression is lost in nearly all human gastric cancers. Our studies have shown that TFF1 is a potent tumor suppressor and anti-inflammatory protein. Our preliminary data in this proposal, using in vitro and in vivo models as well as carcinogenic H. pylori strains, demonstrate that TFF1 suppresses activation of STAT3 and expression of its target genes that are involved in proliferation, anti-apoptosis angiogenesis, invasion, and immune evasion. Based on our novel findings, we hypothesize that TFF1 is as a gatekeeper protein in gastric epithelial cells that suppresses the dynamic pro-inflammatory oncogenic cross-talk between STAT3 and NFkB  in gastric tumorigenesis. Our goal is to understand the molecular and functional consequences of loss of TFF1 as they relate to STAT3 and NF??B cross-talk in H. pylori-induced molecular signaling in the multi- step gastric carcinogenesis cascade. In this proposal, we will investigate the mechanisms by which TFF1 regulates STAT3 in gastric tumorigenesis (Aim 1). We will determine the molecular and biological functions of TFF1 loss and activation of STAT3- NFkB  pro-inflammatory cross-talk signaling in gastric tumorigenesis in Aim 2. In addition, we will investigate the clinical significance and associations between TFF1 loss and activation of NFkB  and STAT3 across stages of human gastric tumorigenesis (Aim 3). We will also test the therapeutic significance of inhibiting STAT3 as a single agent or in combined regimens in pre-clinical models of gastric tumorigenesis. This proposal tackles etiology-based biologically-relevant questions to uncover novel information regarding the role of TFF1-loss in shaping the H. pylori-induced inflammation and carcinogenic signaling in the multi-step gastric tumorigenesis. A successful completion of this project will have a positive impact on understanding the biology and identification of diagnostic, prognostic and possibly therapeutic targets in gastric cancer."
"9441805","ABSTRACT Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder with variable progression caused by the FMR1 premutation. A variety of molecular changes have been documented in those with FXTAS, including mitochondrial dysfunction, sequestration of specific proteins by the CGG-repeat? containing hairpin loops of the FMR1 mRNA, chronic DNA damage repair, and production of the FMRpolyG polypeptide through RAN translation. Although there are many reports of the clinical phenotype of FXTAS, there has never been a longitudinal study of those affected by FXTAS, and consequently, there are no known biomarkers of progression. The proposed project will address this critical need through a prospective longitudinal study of 100 individuals (60 males and 40 females) with FXTAS seen at the MIND Institute at UC Davis. One hundred patients will be followed every 2 years at the MIND Institute, and an additional 20 patients with FXTAS will be seen at La Trobe University in Australia to replicate and validate the findings at the MIND. We will quantify the progression of FXTAS through repetitive assessment of specific clinical measures, including neurological/motor, psychiatric, cognitive, event related potentials (ERP), eye-tracking studies, and MRI/DTI measures. In addition, we will document the molecular/biochemical markers for each stage of FXTAS and correlate these markers with the rate of progression in the clinical domains, including MRI/DTI imaging. We will also identify comorbid conditions or diagnoses that occur with FXTAS, such as autoimmune disease, Parkinsonian features, substance abuse, hypertension, and diabetes; we will evaluate whether these co- morbid conditions affect the progression of FXTAS. We will document the variability of FXTAS progression across domains. We will assess whether females progress more slowly than males with FXTAS, even for those at higher risk for immune-mediated disorders. We plan to develop molecular and biochemical markers of progression and quantitative clinical measures that can be utilized for outcome measures in future clinical trials of treatment of FXTAS. The biochemical/molecular markers will include measures of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, ASFMR1 isoforms, activation ratio, CGG repeats, AGG anchors, and long non-coding RNAs. In an exploratory aim, we will try to detect FMRpolyG protein in tissues, including fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and other tissues that are collected during the course of clinical care, as well as in the brains that are available for collection after death. We will also assess lifestyle factors such as obesity, exercise, and alcohol and drug abuse that may affect the progression of FXTAS."
"9557461","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sports-related concussion in youth is increasingly being recognized as a public health concern. Decreasing the health burden of concussion requires both (a) decreasing the number of concussions that occur by decreasing dangerous collisions (primary prevention) and (b) ensuring that youth are not playing with concussive symptoms and thereby incurring greater risk (secondary prevention). Rules are a promising means for effecting such changes (i.e, outlawing spearing, requiring that athletes be removed from play if a concussion is suspected), but changing rules is not effective if we do not also shift the culture of youth sport regarding safety. Sport cultures that reinforce values of winning-at-all-costs lead athletes, coaches and parents to disregard the rules that are intended to keep athletes safe. Referees, many of whom are often minors themselves, face challenges enforcing rules in such environments. Changing the culture of sport requires a paradigm shift in how we think about intervention. Prior efforts to decrease the incidence of concussion and decrease the rate of youth playing with concussive symptoms have had limited effectiveness because they did not intervene at a systems-level. Changing sport culture requires intervening with multiple stakeholders (referees, coaches, athletes, parents) and addressing the values that underlie a commitment to following rules related to concussion safety. We propose an intervention called ?One Team? that will utilize safety huddles to shift the culture of youth sport. The huddle was originally developed in football, but it has been adopted by the medical system as a way to engage key stakeholders to improve safety. The One Team intervention will use pre-game safety huddles to bring together coaches, athletes, parents and referees to affirm: (a) values of sportsmanship (i.e, not engaging in dangerous and illegal collisions) and (b) shared responsibility that no athlete play while concussed. Working in partnership with football and soccer coaches, athletes, parents and referees in Seattle WA and Statesboro GA using a community-engaged process, we will refine the One Team intervention and conduct pilot evaluations of implementation and efficacy. We will also work with our national partners (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Soccer and USA Football) throughout this research to ensure that the product we develop will align with their organizational needs, dissemination platforms and channels. At the completion of this research we will have an intervention that will shift the culture of safety in youth sport and that can reach all youth sport stakeholders, including those in low resource communities."
"9407009","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex cancer genetics and the multiple pathways operational in cancer motivate the fundamental hypothesis of this Program: Combination therapies that are mechanistically complementary and directed at non-overlapping molecular targets and pathways will significantly advance cancer treatment outcomes. The current, heavily revised application builds on our own findings, recent advances in the understanding of cancer biology and mechanisms and the progress in imaging technologies, to propose new photodynamic therapy (PDT)-based combination treatments for pancreatic cancer (PanCa) and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). PDT is a photochemistry-based modality that is approved for the treatment of a number of cancer and non-cancer pathologies. Strategically, combinations will be selected such that the first treatment enhances the second. This is achieved by: (i) preconditioning tumors with agents that initiate molecular events that augment PDT and (ii) administering a second treatment specifically tailored to a particular molecular response elicited by the first. This second approach is strengthened by our new nanoconstructs (NCs) capable of simultaneous multi-inhibitor delivery. PDT is a standard component of the combination, while the second modality can be small molecule enhancers, chemo or biologic therapeutics. The choice of the specific combination reagent will be heavily influenced by the likelihood of rapid translation to the clinic in Projects 1 and 2. Toward this gol, we have recruited pharmaceutical industries that are already running clinical trials with reagents that may potentially synergize with PDT. Optical imaging will provide online monitoring of light and photosensitizer dosimetry, treatment planning and molecular response. The Program has 4 projects supported by 3 Cores. Project 1 investigates molecular pathways of small molecules that enhance ALA-PDT to increase therapy response in skin carcinomas in humans. Project 2 uses PDT and combinations ('first in human) to address metastasis in addition to local control by PDT and thus advance the survival and quality of life of patients with PanCa and precancer. Project 3 develops NCs combinations in preclinical models (3D in vitro, orthotopic and genetically engineered mice) to steer clinical studies in Project 2 within the current cycle and, i a more forward looking approach develops targeted multi-inhibitor NCs. Project 4 develops quantitative tools to monitor molecular features of tumor treatment response for integrated dosimetry for standard clinical procedures. Cores provide administration, education, models, instrumentation and technology transfer. Impact: This program positively impacts on the treatment and prevention of two cancers: decreasing mortality and morbidity in PanCa with few therapy options and NMSC with many treatment options but a high incidence, thus putting a heavy societal burden of cost and suffering. These findings could also be translated to other cancers. Scientifically, the tools developed (models, imaging and nanotechnology) provide a platform for the evaluation of new therapeutics and mechanisms."
"9444458","Overall Program Summary More than a decade ago our group initiated development of vaccine vectors based on the persistent ?- herpesvirus Cytomegalovirus (CMV) because of the ability of CMV to elicit and indefinitely maintain high frequency effector-differentiated T cell responses in diverse tissues. Using the rhesus macaque (RM) model, we tested the concept that the early pathogen intercept afforded by such ?in place? effector-memory T cells would result in superior protection against immune evasive pathogens like HIV/SIV, relative to the typical memory responses elicited by conventional vaccine approaches. We found that not only was Rhesus (Rh) CMV amenable to ?vectorization? (e.g., we demonstrated that, even when spread-deficient, RhCMV vectors generate potent, durable, exogenous insert-specific effector-memory T cell responses in naturally RhCMV+ RM), but also that the SIV-specific responses elicited by these vectors were reproducibly able to stringently control and then clear mucosally-administered, highly pathogenic SIV from ~54% of vaccinated RM. Although this unprecedented ?control and clear? protection was consistent with an early infection intercept, the nature of the protective immune response remained elusive until we discovered that the Rh157.5/Rh157.4 gene-deleted RhCMV vector used as the backbone of our vaccine had another very unusual immunologic property: all CD8+ T cell elicited by this vector were found to recognize epitopes that were restricted by either MHC-II or MHC-E, not MHC-Ia. We further demonstrated that this unconventional epitope targeting was reverted to conventional MHC-Ia restriction by repair of Rh157.5/Rh157.4 expression, which did not otherwise affect the functional or phenotypic characteristics of vector-elicited CD8+ T cells. Remarkably, the repaired RhCMV/SIV vectors failed to protect against SIV challenge, strongly suggesting that unconventional CD8+ T cell epitope recognition is required for RCMV/SIV vector efficacy. Recent work has demonstrated that conventional vs. unconventional CD8+ T cell priming is regulated by multiple RhCMV genes, the modification of which effectively programs RhCMV vectors to elicit CD8+ T cell responses with distinct epitope recognition patterns. In this program, we first seek to determine the mechanisms responsible for unconventional CD8+ T cell response generation, and develop RhCMV vectors that predominantly or exclusively elicit MHC-II vs. MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses (Projects 2-4). We will then use these new vectors to 1) identify the response type(s) needed for efficacy, 2) determine whether such response focusing improves efficacy, and 3) define quantitative and/or qualitative correlates of this protection (Project 1). Finally, we will use the insight gained in these RM studies to design (Project 4), manufacture and clinically test (Project 5) the safety and immunogenicity of a spread- deficient, ?response-programmed? HCMV/HIV vector designed to elicit the protective response type. If this effort is successful, the result would be a highly effective HIV/AIDS vaccine that alone, or combined with a complementary antibody-targeted vaccine, could substantially contribute to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  "
"9546181","ABSTRACT Infants are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality in response to respiratory virus infections as compared with school age children or adults, but the mechanisms for this clinical observation are not well understood. Vulnerability to respiratory viruses during infancy is likely manifested by an immature lung and immune system. The ability to establish robust protective immunity during infancy is partly limited by developmental shifts in hematopoietic cell function, yet the immune cells that reside within the neonatal lung remain poorly characterized. Even less is known about the epithelial cells of the neonatal lung which could contribute to the immunocompromised state of the human infant given their role in communicating environmental signals to the adaptive immune system. Lastly, how the establishment of commensal bacteria at mucosal sites might influence the immature lung and immune system remains undetermined. Our overall goal is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms for increased respiratory disease susceptibility during the first year of life. We will investigate the contribution of primary commensal colonization in the neonatal lung on severity of respiratory virus infection using an infant rhesus monkey model of influenza infection. We hypothesize that primary commensal colonization in the neonatal lung is essential for development of antiviral defense during early life. To test our hypothesis, we will (1) Characterize the influence of primary commensal colonization in the airways on the severity of influenza infection; (2) Investigate how primary commensal colonization directs the ontogeny and functional development of ILC3. (3) Determine if primary commensal colonization alters the intrinsic transcriptome profile of infant airway epithelium. The limitations of early life immunity present formidable obstacles for effective therapeutic strategies that provide protection against respiratory pathogens in the infant. We anticipate that our collaborative effort to study a translational animal model of neonatal development will bring forth new paradigms in understanding mucosal immunity in the infant that have the potential for durable impact on human health."
"9517165","Sodium (Na+) is an essential nutrient, but humans consume this nutrient in excess which increases the risk of hypertension and stroke. It is currently unknown which cell type within taste buds is responsible for Na+-taste transduction. Here, an optogenetic approach is used to determine whether Type I cells within taste buds are responsible for Na+ taste transduced through epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). Optogenetic manipulation of Type I taste-bud cells allows for selective perturbation of taste-bud circuity with an unprecedented level of precision? unmatched by conventional pharmacology?and serves as a valuable tool for unraveling the enigma of the taste of Na+. This project will test two hypotheses. 1) Optogenetic activation (via Channelrhodopsin-2; ChR2) of Type I cells in fungiform-taste buds activates NaCl-best neurons in the mouse Nucleus Tractus Solitarius (NTS), located in the medulla. 2) Optogenetic activation (via ChR2) of Type I cells in fungiform taste buds elicits Na+ taste and drives Na+ appetite in Na+ deprived mice. Knowledge obtained from these investigations will provide the field with much needed information about the role of Type I cells in taste function, and could provide a target for pharmacological manipulation of taste circuitry to enhance salt taste, thereby decreasing Na+ intake. Such discoveries would have a positive impact on human health and disease afflicted by excess Na+ consumption."
"9469503","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Wearable electronics and computing technology are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life. The prospect of replacing cumbersome medical equipment requiring significant supporting infrastructure in hospitals and medical facilities, with unobtrusive body worn devices that can robustly and securely send and receive data for biomedical sensing and actuation for remote treatment, has the potential to be a disruptive innovation. Whereas the majority of electronic textiles in existence today make use of circuits adhesively integrated onto a host garment, knitting technology at Drexel University enables the realization of garments that have knit sensors and actuators seamlessly integrated within them. We propose to integrate smart fabric sensors and actuators into comfortable garment devices providing unobtrusive prevention options for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), that are not currently possible, particularly in high risk patients. Pregnancy and prolonged sedentary positions are risk factors for DVT. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, DVT/PE impacts between 300,000 to 900,000 people per year in the United States. Consistent with the mission of NIBIB, this project will result in research and development of new biomedical smart textiles that will fundamentally improve the detection, treatment, and prevention of DVT/PE, while encouraging research and development in multidisciplinary areas (e.g., medicine, engineering, fashion design, sociology, nursing, and informatics). Specific aims of the project include: Sensing - Develop an unobtrusive leg mobility measurement system that is seamlessly knitted and requires no batteries or cumbersome electronics. Signal Processing - Develop a real-time, predictive data-driven control system that will allow for robustness to non-deterministic disturbances such as motion artifacts and change in sensor location. Actuation - Develop biomedical smart textiles to provide mechanical stimulation of tissues in the body for remotely actuated treatment."
"9671798","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Suicide, a primary cause of death among middle-aged men (35-64 years old), is the leading cause of injury death among men in this age group in Michigan (state where study takes place). Reliance on traditional mental health services to reach out to and engage men in this age group has not resulted in increased suicide problem recognition or help-seeking behavior. While effective treatment for suicide exists, treatment cannot help men who don't identify as having a problem, and therefore don't see help. The field lacks effective and efficient programs and interventions that actively engage middle-aged men in evidence-based interventions to increase suicide problem identification and help-seeking behavior. We will examine the effectiveness of a comprehensive online screening and referral intervention, specifically designed for men ages 35-64. Primary outcomes include suicide behavior (suicide attempts and preparatory acts), suicide ideation and depression. Secondary outcomes include: attitudes toward help-seeking and help-seeking behavior; suicide risk factors (i.e., alcohol abuse, relationship conflicts, financial problems and interpersonal needs7); and the protective factor of social support. Men who score in the moderate-to-high risk range for depression on the depression screen, or any score for suicide ideation and/or behavior on the suicide screen, will be asked to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Screening for Mental Health; or Screening for Mental Health, plus Man Therapy. Man Therapy is specifically designed for men who are at risk for suicide and less likely to engage in help-seeking behavior. A series of data analysis techniques will be used to evaluate the additive effect of Man Therapy. The core analysis will be a longitudinal mixed-model path analysis testing for between-group and within-group differences on primary and secondary outcomes. The model design will also include estimations of indirect effects (mediation and moderation). Data will be collected on primary outcomes of depression and suicidal behavior and ideation at baseline and then again at 2- and 12-weeks post randomization to study arm. Secondary outcomes will be measured 2- and 12-weeks post randomization to study arm. Using a sequential mixed-methods research design, researchers will interview a purposive sub-sample of men referred to both study arms to further assess and compare barriers and facilitators to men seeking suicide prevention services. This innovative study, which can be widely applicable to other states across the country, may advance suicide prevention among middle-aged men, a high-risk group for suicide who tend to be difficult to engage in suicide problem identification and help-seeking behavior."
"9465237","Abstract The effects of repetitive heading in soccer, outside the purview of recognized concussion, are a topic of major public importance that has not been well defined. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that repetitive sub-concussive soccer heading is associated with evidence of microstructural tissue damage as well as cognitive impairments. We have found that there exists a threshold number of heads per year whereby subclinical and clinical impairments are evident. Despite this evidence of axonal and functional damage, we have not characterized individuals at greater and/or reduced risk for deterioration from repetitive soccer heading. In this proposed study we will investigate trait biomarkers hypothesized to have an association with neurodegenerative processes subsequent to brain injury. Specifically, we will examine the effect-modifying role of the Apolipoprotein E, Cholesterol Esterase Transfer Protein and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor polymorphisms. Furthermore, we will explore the extent to which the ex-vivo inflammatory stress response can explain the heterogeneity in outcomes. Under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Lipton and investigators with varying expertise pertaining to the project, I am confident that I will accomplish my goal of identifying biomarkers that confer greater vulnerability to heading related impairments. Furthermore, I will receive excellent training in clinical research methods and basic science techniques alike, which will serve as an excellent foundation for my ultimate goal of becoming an independent clinical Investigator.  "
"9626831","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application by investigators at the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, P.R. China, is submitted in response to PAR-14-080 'International Research in Infectious Diseases, including AIDS (R01)'. Along with HIV infection, KSHV and KS have emerged as an important health problem worldwide. The increase in incidence of KSHV-associated tumors in the HIV population is of international concern especially in under-developed countries, such as China. Studies towards the elucidation of the mechanism for KSHV-induced tumorigenesis will provide new therapeutic targets. In KS lesions, the majority of tumor cells are latently infected by KSHV and express viral proteins such as latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA), suggesting an essential role for viral latent infection in tumorigenesis. Using tandem affinity purification (TAP) technology, we identified Krüppel associated box domain associated protein-1 (KAP1) as a novel LANA-binding protein. KAP1 functions as a transcriptional repressor and can change epigenetic state by recruiting histone deacetylase and methyltransferase complex. We previously showed that LANA recruited KAP1 to the RTA promoter region of the KSHV genome, which was involved in transcriptional repression of RTA by LANA. Since KAP1 is an important transcription corepressor, we hypothesize that LANA is capable of regulating global host gene expression through interaction with KAP1. In this project, we will determine whether and how LANA contributes to the pro-proliferative gene signature of KSHV infected cell by down-regulating expression of cellular tumor repressor genes. On the other hand, our previous studies showed that LANA up-regulated BMP-Smad1-Id signaling through sustained BMP-activated p-Smad1 in the nucleus and enhanced its loading on the promoter of BMP target gene Id. We showed that Id proteins were significantly up-regulated in KSHV transformed KMM cells and abundantly expressed in human KS lesions. Strikingly, genetic inhibition of the BMP-Smad1-Id pathway significantly blocked the oncogenic phenotype of KSHV-transformed cells in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, Id proteins also play critical roles in angiogenesis both during embryogenesis and tumor formation. Thus, we proposed to determine whether LANA modulates BMP-Smad1-Id signaling to facilitate tumor angiogenesis, since abundant angiogenesis is the feature of KS and is the key factor for KS progress. Moreover, we will also determine how LANA regulates the termination process of BMP-induced p-Smad1 activation and the mechanisms by which of Id proteins contribute to angiogenic phenotype of KMM cells. Finally, we will use various BMP signaling inhibitors to evaluate their inhibition efficacy on the tumorigenicity and pro-angiogenic phenotype of KMM cells. Through our studies, we expect to reveal novel insights onto the versatile functions of LANA in KSHV-related malignancies."
"9435161","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our research, supported by this grant over the years, has focused on identifying and characterizing novel neural messenger molecules and their roles in psychotropic drug actions. We propose new studies based on recent advances in this area involving, in particular, gasotransmitters and D-amino acids. Based on our earlier work on NO and CO, we have recently identified hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a notable signaling molecule. We established its biosynthesis by cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine- beta-synthase (CBS) by demonstrating its depletion with CSE and CBS knockout. We showed that H2S signals by sulfhydrating cysteines in target proteins, analogous to NO acting by nitrosylation. We will map CBS/CSE and their catalytic activity via a novel histochemical stain for H2S generation from cysteine. We will characterize new sulfhydrated targets. Based on our findings regarding CSE's transcriptional induction, we will elucidate the enzyme's turnover under diverse conditions. Recently we discovered a profound depletion of CSE in Huntington's Disease (HD) reflecting mutant huntingtin affecting the CSE transcription factor SP1. Pathophysiologic relevance was evident in the alleviation of the HD phenotype by rescue in cultures and intact mice by cysteine supplementation. We will further characterize cysteine/H2S dynamics in HD mice and neural cultures. The cysteine depletion may also account for the inanition of HD patients. Accordingly, we will also investigate the regulation by CSE of adiposity. We established D-serine as an endogenous agonist for glutamate-NMDA receptors, identifying, cloning and characterizing its biosynthetic enzyme serine racemase (SR). Recently, we discovered that SR can link AMPA and NMDA glutamate transmission. SR binds the AMPA receptor accessory protein stargazin leading to membrane association and SR inhibition. SR also binds PSD-95 from which it is dissociated by NMDA treatment. We will elucidate the physiologic significance of SR in an apparent cross-talk between AMPA and NMDA receptor systems. We recently identified substantial levels of D-cysteine in mammalian brain and other tissues. We have developed a novel sensitive and specific assay for tissue D-cysteine. We will monitor D-cysteine levels in diverse tissues under varying circumstances. We will seek biosynthetic mechanisms for D-cysteine via known or hitherto unidentified enzymes."
"9475071","The Cancer Systems Biology Center will develop a new core, the Single-Cell Analysis Core. This core will provide technical, bioinformatic, and training support for the Center. Cancers represent heterogeneous collections of cells interacting within the cancer, but also affecting the host through systemic signaling and metastatic expansion. High-throughput sequencing of single cells provides direct insight into the complexity of the cancer cell population. The high-throughput, but noisy data generated from single- cell experiments presents new challenges to investigators. Similar to the advent of other breakthrough technologies, diverse approaches and innovative analysis must accompany technological development. The goal of Core technical support is to make cost-effective high-throughput analysis of single cells optimal for and accessible to each of the three Projects. Technical support will consist of providing staff and instrument infrastructure, as well as advising on design of experimental strategies, facilitating sharing of protocols for process development; providing single-cell services including microscopy, protein localization, cell sorting, library production, and sequencing; and working with investigators to innovate in these technologies. The goal of bioinformatic support by the Core is to develop analysis pipelines optimized as appropriate for the three main Projects; mediate active sharing of data from the projects through uniform reporting standards and a shared server; and finally fostering awareness of technological advances within the Center and throughout the broader systems and cancer communities. Training support for the Center is one of the most critical Core functions, necessitated by the challenging pace of technological change. The Core will advise and survey Center members as to target areas for workshops open to students, fellows, staff, and faculty. Workshops will range in focus from wet bench workshops for cell isolation and sorting; custom library production, C1 and Chromium platform walk-up use, and microscopic screening of cell samples for sequencing to bioinformatic workshops on single-cell commercial software (C1 Fluidigm software; Cell Ranger; and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis etc.) and open source analysis software and statistical packages for single cells. Finally, the Single-Cell Analysis Core will establish a biweekly Cancer Single-Cell Research Meeting in which both current literature and research in progress will be discussed. The new Single-Cell Analysis Core will promote and integrate the progress of the three research Projects."
"9671799","Project Summary/Abstract Community pharmacies provide an ideal setting for identification of patients at risk for falls. North Carolina Medicaid claims data indicate that the population most in need of medication management services visit the pharmacy an average of 35 times annually, while only seeing their primary care physician 2-4 times annually. In the proposed project, we will use a prospective, cohort design to investigate an outpatient care model that links a network of community pharmacies (CPESN) with primary care practices. The CPESN pharmacies in the intervention group will (1) screen for risk of falling using questions from the STEADI Tool Kit, (2) conduct a comprehensive medication review with fall prevention education, and (3) refer to other members of the health care team for additional falls assessment. The CPESN intervention group will use a monthly attribution report to identify older adults at high risk for falls. This report includes the total number of medications and high-risk medications that each patient is taking as well as if the patient had a recent fall-related emergency department visit. CPESN pharmacies will use a shared software application, PHARMACeHOME, to communicate with primary care practices. In this project, PHARMACeHOME will be used for two primary purposes. First, pharmacists will make recommendations to minimize exposure to medications associated with an increased risk of falls identified in the comprehensive medication review. Second, pharmacists will refer for additional falls assessment that are beyond the scope of pharmacy practice. By utilizing the shared software application, we hope to alleviate several barriers to coordination of care. Outcomes achieved in the network (CPESN) pharmacies that implement the intervention will be compared to those achieved in two comparison groups: (1) CPESN pharmacies that do not implement the intervention, and (2) non-CPESN pharmacies in North Carolina. Data from the three cohorts will be analyzed to evaluate the falls intervention program on: (1) use of high-risk medications (primary outcome variable) and (2) the rate of fall-related emergency department visits (secondary outcome variable). For all patients, data will be collected 1-year before and 1-year after the index date, determined on the basis of when the patient is identified as using medications associated with an increased risk of falling. If successful, this community pharmacy-primary care linkage model could have huge implications on the health benefits, costs and sustainability to health care.      "

"9427995","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The discovery of the antiviral APOBEC3 enzymes is regarded as one of the most therapeutically promising breakthroughs in HIV/AIDS molecular virology. Several APOBEC3s have the potential to restrict HIV replication by incorporating into assembling viral particles, physically interfering with the progression of reverse transcription, and deaminating viral cDNA cytosines to uracils. The latter antiviral activity is the defining hallmark of APOBEC3-mediated restriction, explaining the genomic strand G-to-A mutations that are frequently observed in patient-derived viral sequences. However, these potent antiviral activities are counteracted by the HIV virion infectivity factor (Vif), which heterodimerizes with CBF-beta in order to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that degrades APOBEC3 enzymes. Here, we will address two persisting problems in this field. First, we will determine x-ray structures of APOBEC3-bound Vif/CBF-beta ubiquitin ligase complexes. These structures will provide insights into the APOBEC3-Vif binding mechanism, conformational changes, and the overall organization of these host-pathogen complexes. Second, we will elucidate X-ray structures of APOBEC3/single-stranded DNA complexes. These structures will provide insights into the mechanisms of enzymatic catalysis, DNA substrate recognition, and coupling between DNA-binding and the release of catalytic activity. We anticipate that structural information from both APOBEC3/Vif/CBF-beta and APOBEC3/single-stranded DNA macromolecular complexes will be important in the longer-term as the field continues to move toward drugging these interactions and enabling potent HIV-1 restriction through natural innate immunity."
"9444462","Core C (Virology and Vector Production) Summary This IPCAVD program proposal builds on an innovative strategy for AIDS vaccine development that takes advantage of the ability of recombinant strain 68-1 rhesus CMV (RhCMV) vectors expressing SIV antigens to elicit long-lived, tissue-based effector memory CD8+ T cell responses that are specifically restricted by MHC-II and MHC-E, rather than by classical MHC-Ia. We have demonstrated in rhesus macaques (RM) that these unique immune responses result in, and are required for, stringent control and eventual clearance of highly pathogenic SIV in 54% of vaccinated RM that were mucosally challenged with the highly pathogenic SIVmac239 clone. Recently, we have also shown that the deletion of Rh157.5/Rh157.4 genes in RhCMV (the RhCMV homologs of the HCMV UL128 and UL130 genes) is necessary for the induction of unconventional CD8+ T cell restriction and thereby, the efficacy of our vaccine. We have also begun to discover other RhCMV gene loci and viral tropism determinants participate in the programming of various aspects of the CD8+ T cell immune response, for the first time allowing for the creation of ?response-programmed? vaccine vectors. This IPCAVD program seeks to further determine the mechanisms of CD8+ T cell unconventional response programming by RhCMV, and to define the nature the responses required for protection against SIV challenge. This knowledge will be then used to design and manufacture next-generation human CMV (HCMV) vectors for safety and immunogenicity testing in HIV/AIDS vaccine clinical trials. To accomplish all of this, this proposal brings together experienced investigators that provide complementary expertise in their projects with the common goals of designing, constructing, and testing the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of such response-programmed vaccine vectors. Core C will play a key role in supporting these efforts and integrating the different projects by the provision of standardized virology services and assays. Specifically, Core C will support the project-specific in vivo studies through production and characterization of recombinant RhCMV and HCMV vectors, monitoring of virus loads and secretions, and ultrasensitive PCR characterization of virus biodistribution in host tissues."
"9540483","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is application for support of the 49th annual ASN meeting to be held in Riverside, California from March 24-28, 2018. Previous NIH funding has been invaluable for supporting our scientific programs and for enhancing our ability to involve graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and underrepresented groups. To accommodate the breadth of neurochemistry and to provide in-depth analyses of particular topics, the ASN continues to build its scientific program around four interwoven, but distinct, themes. These themes have been selected to increase our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of neural development and disease. These four themes are: 1) Building the Nervous System/Neurodevelopment, 2) Cellular Metabolism and Neurotransmission/Cognition, 3) Glial Function in Health and Disease, and 4) Neurodegeneration; each theme has one of the four Plenary/Presidential speakers. The ASN is strongly committed to the representation of women and racial/ethnic minorities at its meetings. One of the four Plenary/Presidential speakers is female, 40% of the Chairs/Co-Chairs of Symposia and Colloquia are female, and 9% of the Chairs/Co-Chairs are from racial/ethnic minorities; 43% of the Speakers of Symposia and Colloquia are female, while 7% are from racial/ethnic minorities. The ASN strongly supports young investigators in their development; 11% of the Chairs/Co-Chairs of Symposia and Colloquia and 5% of the Session Speakers are at the pre-faculty, i.e. post- doctoral/graduate student levels.  The ASN meeting provides numerous opportunities for participants to exchange ideas and to form new collaborations because total expected attendance is ~ 300, and there are numerous opportunities incorporated in our program for participants to congregate informally. The Society also has several mechanisms to enhance the professional development of junior investigators during the meeting. We organize meetings with the Plenary/Presidential speakers, which gives attendees a chance to discuss topics directly with the speakers. The fees for these meetings are reduced for students and postdoctoral fellows. There is a mingle that included an educational/mentoring component, exclusively for students and postdoctoral fellows. This event has been repeatedly recognized as an outstanding opportunity to network. There is a function entitled ?Women in Neurochemistry? that is open to all attendees, and junior investigators have reduced fees. There are Oral Sessions, which are selected from abstracts submitted, with an emphasis on choosing presentations from graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. There are travel awards for outstanding graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior researchers to defray their costs of attendance. We host a job-posting site and students can meet with potential future mentors or colleagues during the meeting. In 2010, we added a program for visiting high-school students to engage these future scientists. From results of yearly exit surveys, we know that the annual ASN meeting will continue to provide an excellent venue for cutting edge neurochemistry and neurobiology, and for enhancing the careers of young investigators."

One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains)."
"9663542","Novel Glyco-Tests to Predict Chemoresistance Project summary Two carbohydrate structures whose expression levels on ovarian tumor cells are directly linked to tumor responses to platinum-based chemotherapy (pt-CHEMOs) are identified. While not found on healthy ovarian cells, these glycans (glycomarkers 1 and 2) are expressed to varying degrees on cancerous cells, rendering each of these molecules a reliable indicator in predicting responses to pt-CHEMOs. A highly sensitive lectin histochemistry (LHC) assay was developed to detect each glycomarker on Formalin-fixed, Paraffin-embedded, (FFPE) tissue sections. This LHC performance was initially confirmed for specificity, reproducibility, and sensitivity, using various staining systems. Its feasibility for clinical use was consequently confirmed on a training panel composed of 64 healthy and cancerous ovarian tissues. In a retrospective study with 27 ovarian cancer specimens, collected before any treatment, LHC correctly predicted the response to first- line chemotherapy in 25 of 27 (92%) and 19 of 27 (70%) tested for glycomarkers 1 and 2, respectively; The preliminary cut-points of the glycomarker expressions were deduced for three clinical groups of refractory (failing the initial chemotherapy) 0-10%; resistant (recurring within six months following chemotherapy)10-30%; and sensitive (in remission for at least 6 months following chemotherapy) >30%.  In Phase I of the proposed study, the LHC validation for chemo reactivity will be ascertained by testing the glycomarker expressions on a large set (140) of un-treated ovarian cancer specimens whose response to pt- CHEMOs will be available for retrospective correlation analysis. Triplxed-immunofluorescent with a panel of three markers consisting of CA125 (ovarian cancer marker), PanCK (epithelial marker) and a glycomarker, will quantify the glycomarker expressions on tumor sections prior to treatment. Both digital cytometry and scoring by two pathologists, in blind fashion, will be used to analyze the LHC assay. Statistical analysis with a large data set will address the following study aims; Aim 1) to determine the correlation between drug response and glycomarker expression levels and; Aim 2) to define the cut-points for each glycomarker expression on ovarian cancer patients in three clinical classifications (refractory/resistant/sensitive). The key milestone in Phase-I will be completing the statistical validation, to determine whether the LHC can be offered as a laboratory-developed test (LDT), not requiring FDA approval. Meanwhile, we will be developing required data, in Phase II, to get prepared for FDA submission. The final commercial product will be clinical kits to provide guidance for personalized chemotherapy. Our approach to predicting resistance to pt-CHEMOs will also have prospective applications to other cancer types that express these glycomarkers and are also treated with pt-CHEMOS. Overall, the LHC offers a companion diagnostic test for Pt-CHEMOs that identifies chemoresistant patients, thereby giving them a hope at being treated sooner and with more promising second line options, and consequently, increasing their chance of survival and quality of life."
"9601238","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) controls DA homeostasis and neurotransmission by the active reuptake of synaptically released DA. The DAT is the major molecular target responsible for the rewarding properties and the abuse potential of amphetamine (AMPH) and cocaine. AMPH acts as a DAT substrate, promoting the reversal of DA transport, thereby resulting in DA efflux via DAT. This efflux leads to increased extracellular DA levels, an event of importance for the psychomotor stimulant properties of AMPHs.  The N-terminus of the DAT is a structural domain that is critical for AMPH to cause DA efflux. We demonstrated that DAT N-terminus phosphorylation at the five most distal Ser is required for AMPH-induced DA efflux. The soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein syntaxin1 (Stx1) interacts with the DAT N-terminus and this interaction supports the ability of AMPH to cause DA efflux. Stx1 is phosphorylated at Ser14 by casein kinase 2 (CK2)1, an event we hypothesize is promoted by AMPH and regulates DAT-Stx1 association. Finally, we discovered that phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (a cofactor we show interacts with Stx1) directly interacts with the DAT N-terminus, and here we hypothesize coordinates Stx1 phosphorylation, leading to DA efflux. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that AMPH-induced Stx1 phosphorylation mediated by CK2 leads to DAT N-terminus phosphorylation. These events are coordinated by DAT-PIP2 interaction and are required to transmit the actions of AMPH. We propose to test our hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1) To define how DAT-Stx1 association is coordinated under basal and AMPH conditions; and 2) To determine the role of Stx1 phosphorylation in AMPH-induced DA efflux.  To test our molecular discoveries in vivo, we have developed a behavioral model in Drosophila melanogaster. In this system, we have established that locomotion is a DAT-regulated behavior, and is stimulated by AMPH. Deletion of Drosophila DAT (dDAT) in DA neurons of flies inhibits AMPH-induced locomotion, an effect that is restored by the expression of the human DAT (hDAT) in these dDAT-deficient DA neurons. Using this strategy, we will translate in vivo our molecular observations. We will elucidate how CK2-mediated Stx1 phosphorylation and Stx1 interaction with the DAT N-terminus determine AMPH behaviors. Thus, our last specific aim is: 3) To determine the role of DAT-Stx1 interactions in AMPH-induced behaviors.  The long-term goal of this research is to understand how AMPH-induced DA efflux and its associated behaviors are dictated and coordinated by Stx1 phosphorylation. Supported by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that inhibiting CK2 function impairs specifically DA efflux, but not uptake. Thus, we will learn how to selectively manipulate different aspects of the DAT transport cycle and determine the contribution of DA efflux in AMPH behaviors. This will uncover a new druggable target (CK2) for the treatment of AMPH abuse."
"9617935","PROJECT ABSTRACT This K99/R00 Career Development Award will provide the applicant, Dr. Warren Andersen, with the research experience and training to propel her into a career as an independent investigator in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology with a focus on the interplay between race, modifiable risk factors, and the genetic determinants of cancer risk and outcomes. The research plan uses Mendelian randomization methods to evaluate the hypothesis that circulating and bioavailable vitamin D levels are associated with decreased colorectal cancer risk. Mendelian randomization (MR) methods can be used to evaluate the associations between long-term exposures and diseases by using genetic variants as instrumental variables in place of exposures. Dr. Warren Andersen will also assess whether vitamin D binding protein modifies the association between vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk. The project will leverage resources from three established epidemiologic consortia (the ColoRectal Transdisciplinary Study (CORECT) consortium, a colorectal cancer genome-wide association study consortium among African Americans, and the Asia Colorectal Cancer Consortium) and the Southern Community Cohort Study to evaluate associations in large samples including individuals of European, Asian and African descent. Dr. Warren Andersen will create race-specific genetic scores to represent circulating vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. Fine-mapping will be conducted to identify potentially causal variants to be included in the vitamin D genetic scores. These genetic scores will then be assessed for associations with overall colorectal cancer risk, and colorectal cancer risk stratified by specific characteristics of the tumor such as COX-2 expression, PIK3CA mutation status, and stage. During the Career Development Award Dr. Warren Andersen will gain additional skills in genetic analysis and increase her knowledge in colorectal cancer biology and health disparities. The findings from this research project will be used to develop and submit two R01 level projects before the completion of the Career Development Award. The additional experience gained from this Career Development Award will prepare Dr. Warren Andersen to be a leader in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology of cancer, with expertise in colorectal cancer etiology, genetic and cancer epidemiology, and the root causes of racial differences in disease risk. This research topic is of much significance, as the Institute of Medicine's 2010 Report stated, investigation into the causal relationships between vitamin D and total and site-specific cancers is an important research need. The use of MR and molecular epidemiologic methods should provide a more definitive answer to the questions of the relationships of colorectal cancer risk with circulating vitamin D, bioavailable vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. This study will provide insight into colorectal cancer etiology and potentially identify subgroups of individuals who may benefit the most from vitamin D supplementation."
"9522714","SUMMARY  The long-term goal of this project is to investigate mechanisms underlying noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy and hidden hearing loss. Noise is a common risk factor for hearing loss. Recent studies have demonstrated that even a single episode of noise overexposure induces transient hearing loss, i.e., temporal threshold shift (TTS), noise-exposed animals could have no hair cell loss but have extensive spiral ganglion neuron (SG) and synapse degeneration. In particular, low spontaneous rate (LSR) auditory nerves and their synaptic connections with inner hair cells are preferentially lost. The noise-exposed animals and humans demonstrate normal hearing threshold and sensitivity (i.e., hidden hearing loss) in the early stage but will eventually exhibit other hearing disorders and hearing loss. Currently, the underlying mechanism for such cochlear synaptopathy remains unclear.  Noise stimulates hair cell and neuron over-activation and increases K+ efflux that leads to increasing extracellular K+ concentration. It is well-established that high extracellular K+ can induce toxicity leading to second cell death in the brain following injury and stroke. We hypothesize that high, excess extracellular K+ following noise exposure can also cause SG synapse and neuron degeneration in the cochlea. We previously found that ATP purinergic P2X receptors in the cochlea are required for sinking K+ to re-enter into cells. A recent study also demonstrated that P2X2 receptors are necessary for the development of TTS. In addition, we found that P2X2 mutation can increase susceptibility to noise and induce hearing loss. These studies indicate that P2X receptors may have a critical role in noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy and hidden hearing loss. In this project, we will first test whether high extracellular K+ can cause SG synapse and neuron degeneration (Specific Aim 1, SA1). Then, we will identify and characterize P2X receptor expression in SG neurons, including LSR and HSR (high spontaneous rate) fiber synaptic endings, and test whether P2X receptors can mediate K+-sinking in the SG neurons. In SA3, we will test whether deficiency of P2X receptors can induce and exacerbate cochlear synaptopathy and hearing loss following noise exposure and high-K+ challenge. Completion of these studies will directly reveal the molecular mechanism underlying noise-induced cochlear synaptic degeneration and hidden hearing loss. These novel studies will also open a new therapeutic avenue for targeting noise-induced hearing loss and cochlear synaptopathy."
"9375247","Project Summary Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease characterized by the progressive remodeling of the distal pulmonary arteries, resulting in the loss of vascular cross-sectional area and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Without intervention, PAH is usually progressive, leading to right heart failure and death. Pulmonary vascular remodeling includes the proliferation and migration of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Several studies have shown that increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels result in a reduction of vascular cells proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and it has recently been discovered that members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters family can actively transport cAMP out of cells. Moreover, we recently reported secreted cardiomyocyte-cAMP into the extracellular space to be an important paracrine factor in the myocardium that also protects the heart from adrenergically induced hypertrophy and fibrosis. Extracellular cAMP is metabolized to adenosine, which activates its receptors that are expressed in several cells. Because adenosine is known to be a potent inhibitor of vascular remodeling (through its Gs protein-coupled receptors), we aim to study the presence of the extracellular cAMP pathway in pulmonary vascular cells. Our goal is to attenuate pulmonary vascular remodeling by using the extracellular cAMP pathway as a therapeutic approach to reverse the pathological changes in PAH. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to define the presence of the extracellular cAMP pathway in pulmonary artery cells, 2) to evaluate the effects of extracellular cAMP on vascular cells proliferation and migration, as well as determining its mechanism, 3) to assess the effects of endogenous secreted-cAMP in pulmonary vascular cells and 4) to investigate the impact of extracellular cAMP infusion in in vivo models of PAH. Defining the presence and the mechanisms of the extracellular cAMP pathway and its physiological consequences will be of great relevance in the analysis of the PAH disease. Targeting the extracellular cAMP pathway might be a useful strategy to prevent and treat pulmonary hypertension."
"9418591","With more than 380 million people currently affected, and an estimated 590 million by 2035, diabetes is a pandemic. Over time, 30-40% of diabetic patients develop nephropathy (DN), the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation to sustain the patient's life. Lack of mechanistic aspects of DN pathogenesis is a significant impediment to rational development of new therapeutic treatments for preventing or delaying the progression to diabetic ESRD.  We have recently demonstrated that collagen IV, a major component of renal extracellular matrix (ECM), is functionally damaged by hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in diabetic kidney, thus defining a new paradigm for investigating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying ECM lesions in diabetes. We propose to determine how this oxidative damage occurs and contributes to DN susceptibility and pathogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that pro-oxidative environment in diabetes causes excessive production of HOCl by a molecular complex discovered in our laboratory, which includes ECM-bound enzyme peroxidasin (PXDN), hypohalous acids (HOCl/HOBr) and extracellular chloride. The high levels of HOCl cause modification of collagen IV and cellular phospholipids at cell-ECM interface in renal glomerulus, thus perturbing collagen IV network stability and interaction with glomerular cells. This HOCl-derived damage contributes to progressive DN lesions, whereas inhibition of the damage ameliorates DN progression.  The proposal will utilize the DN-prone and DN-resistant diabetic mouse models, conventional and imaging mass spectrometry,  and pyridoxamine, an investigational drug, now in phase 3 clinical trials in DN, which is a scavenger of HOCl in vitro and in vivo. The proposal seeks 1) to determine how PXDN-mediated level of HOCl is affected by diabetic milieu; 2) to determine mechanism whereby modification of renal collagen IV by HOCl disrupts integrin-dependent cell-ECM interactions and compromises network stability in DN; and 3) to identify HOCl-derived chlorinated lipids and determine their effects on glomerular cells and contribution to glomerular lesions in DN.  It is anticipated that the findings will give insight into mechanisms of DN susceptibility and pathogenesis and will establish a platform for the development of new drug candidates to slow DN progression."
"9463450","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-range objectives of these studies are to elucidate the functions of the elastic extracellular matrix in human development and physiology, to uncover the molecular mechanisms of disease caused by elastic fiber (EF) dysfunction and to develop novel treatment strategies for these diseases. Several lines of recent evidence highlight the complexity of EF assembly. Cell biological and biochemical studies illustrate the dynamic, hierarchical and cell mediated nature of EF biogenesis. However, key molecular determinants of this process have remained elusive. Molecular genetic studies of patients with vascular anomalies, emphysema and cutis laxa (CL) show that multiple genes are required for distinct steps of the EF formation. These studies identified mutations in the genes for elastin, fibulin-4, fibulin-5, the a2 subunit of the v- type H+-ATPase, and the latent transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 4 (LTBP4), highlighting the existence of a network of molecules required for elastogenesis. New preliminary data from our studies now demonstrate the existence of new CL genes and show that a downstream effect of different cutis laxa mutations includes dysregulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGFß) signaling through novel mechanisms. Based on these results we hypothesize that cutis laxa is caused by the disruption of EF biogenesis at multiple levels leading to both structural disruption of elastic fibers and by altere storage and release of growth factors in the extracellular matrix and by affecting the stability an activity of growth factor receptors. To address these hypotheses we propose (1) to investigate the genetic program of human EF formation by in-depth phenotyping and identifying disease-causing mutations in patients with CL, emphysema and vascular anomalies. In addition to mutational profiling of recently discovered genes, we will use whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and array comparative genomic hybridization to identify novel genes for these disorders. In aim 2, we will use in vitro models of EF assembly to identify the sequence of molecular interactions between extracellular matrix molecules impacted by cutis laxa mutations. We will also study the mechanisms by which EF dysfunction leads to dysregulation of growth factor activity. In aim 3, we intend to investigate dissect the role of cutis laxa genes in early cardiovascular and connective tissue development. We will use genetics and small molecule drugs to identify the contribution of EF dysfunction and altered growth factor signaling to developmental lesions."
"9545535","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose here our overall plan for the Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) at the University of Washington for the next five years. One of the original three Prevention Research Centers funded by CDC in 1986, HPRC focuses on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities among adults aged 50 and older. Building on our 15 years of experience conducting dissemination and implementation research aimed at scale-up of effective interventions, we plan to focus our work in three areas: cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion.  Specifically, we will expand the national reach of three flagship healthy-aging programs that were developed and tested by HPRC and disseminated by community organizations partnering with HPRC. First is EnhanceFitness, a group-exercise program for older adults. Since 1999, Senior Services, a Seattle-based non- profit organization serving older adults, has disseminated EnhanceFitness to more than 500 community sites in more than 30 states. It has reached more than 25,000 older adults, most of whom are low-income or members of racial and ethnic minorities. Second is PEARLS, a depression-management program delivered in community settings. Since 2003, Area Agencies on Aging have delivered PEARLS to more than 2,000 low-income, largely fragile and home-bound older adults with depression, through 45 sites in 14 states. Third is Workplace Solutions, a package of evidence-based cancer prevention practices for the workplace. Since 2003, the American Cancer Society has disseminated Workplace Solutions to more than 1,600 workplaces with 6.9 million employees in 42 states.  Scale-up of the EnhanceFitness program, with a focus on reducing race/ethnicity-related disparities in arthritis suffering, will be the objective of our Core Researh Project. In 2011, Senior Services licensed EnhanceFitness to YMCA of the USA (Y-USA), the national-network office for more than 2,700 YMCAs. Because EnhanceFitness decreases pain and increases mobility for persons with arthritis, Y-USA will focus its EnhanceFitness implementation on the half of older adults who suffer from arthritis. Older adults are much more likely to participate in a community-based program like EnhanceFitness if it is recommended by a health care provider, so Y-USA has asked for HPRC's help in enhancing its current, limited approach to increasing provider recommendations for EnhanceFitness participation. To do so, we will first conduct formative research with pharmacists and physical therapists to learn the most effective means of increasing recommendations to a community-based program like EnhanceFitness. Second, we will develop an enhanced approach tailored to obtaining recommendations by pharmacists, physical therapists, and primary-care providers for participation of older-adult arthritis patients in EnhanceFitness at YMCAs. Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches."
"9647766","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Naphthalene (NA) is a ubiquitous pollutant to which humans are widely exposed. NA causes tumors in rats and mice, and has been classified as a Possible Human Carcinogen. The mechanism of NA carcinogenicity is believed to involve repeated cycles of NA-induced acute lung injury and repair. A prerequisite for NA cytotoxicity is its bioactivation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes; the reactive metabolites formed, which derive from the NA-epoxide (NA-O), can deplete cellular glutathione (GSH) and, at higher concentrations, bind covalently to tissue proteins. NA-O can be produced by both lung and liver. The major enzymes responsible for NA bioactivation in the mouse include CYP2A5 and CYP2F2; Cyp2f2-null mice are highly resistant to NA lung toxicity, whereas Cyp2a5-null mice are partially protected against NA nasal toxicity. Both human lung and human liver are capable of metabolizing NA, although large interindividual variations exist in the rates of microsomal NA metabolism and bioactivation. However, the roles of human CYP2A13 and CYP2F1 (orthologs of mouse CYP2A5 and CYP2F2, respectively) in NA bioactivation are not well understood, and the potential impact of variations in hepatic P450 function on an individual's risks of developing NA- mediated lung toxicity remains undefined. The objectives of this application are to define the role of CYP2A13 and CYP2F1 in NA bioactivation and toxicity in the lungs of CYP2A13/2F1-humanized mice; identify human lung regions that are enriched in CYP2A13/2F1 expression; and determine whether P450- mediated NA bioactivation and/or detoxification in the liver could contribute to, or otherwise influence, NA lung toxicity. The central hypothesis is that NA has the potential to cause lung toxicity in humans and that the metabolism of NA in both lung and liver influence the outcome on an individual basis. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims that will 1) define the role of CYP2A13 and CYP2F1 in NA bioactivation and toxicity in the lung; 2) define whether hepatic NA metabolism could influence the risks of NA lung toxicity. We will employ a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches, and utilize a number of genetically modified mouse models, as well as human tissues and cells, to address the specific aims. The long-term goal of these studies is to define the metabolic mechanisms that influence NA-mediated lung toxicity in experimental animals and humans."
"9606197","OVERALL ? PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is to generate new information about how fluid- electrolyte balance is regulated and thus contributes to blood pressure control. Our studies largely focus on mechanisms related to endothelin-1 (ET-1) and its associated receptors, ETA and ETB. Previous studies from investigators on the project team revealed a significant role for this system in controlling renal handling of salt and water balance, control of renal hemodynamics, and blood pressure regulation. Investigators have demonstrated that defects in this system results in hypertension that is highly sensitive to dietary salt intake. This is a complicated yet powerful system that balances the vasodilatory and pro-natriuretic actions of the ETB receptor with the vasoconstrictor pro-inflammatory effects of ETA receptor activation. Exploring both renal tubular actions, primarily in the collecting duct, along with hemodynamic effects represents a diverse approach that is unique to this PPG. Our proposed program has several major themes that seek to elucidate novel mechanisms of renal control of sodium handling. In Project 1, we have evidence that ET-1 contributes to circadian regulation of blood pressure, and so we will explore how ET-1 impacts sodium excretion at different times of day. Project 2 will closely examine how alterations in renal tubular fluid flow that are associated with varying body fluid volume status modulate production of ET-1 within the collecting duct system and how it is regulated by the primary cilia, polycystins and other mediators. Recent findings from Project 3 have demonstrated a unique regulatory system involving acetylation and deacetylation of NOS1 in the collecting duct that impacts sodium handling and salt-dependent changes in blood pressure. Furthermore, both NOS1 and NOS3 are expressed in principal cells of the collecting duct, and so we have proposed a novel hypothesis whereby these two enzymes are regulating different aspects of cellular function. In addition, Projects 2 and 3 investigate how NOS1 and NOS3 in the collecting duct modulate both ET-1 production and actions. Finally, two cores support this PPG: the administrative core and the animal and analytical core. The administrative core manages and coordinates overall PPG activities, provides financial accounting and budgetary support, schedules and arranges meetings of PPG investigators, and manages statistical analysis and data management activities. Core B, the animal and analytical core, is responsible for managing breeding and genotyping for rodents in all three projects. In conclusion, these studies are expected to uncover important regulatory pathways that will aid our understanding of fluid-electrolyte and blood pressure control in health and in disease."
"9448501","PROJECT SUMMARY Long-term heavy alcohol drinking causes organ injury, and multiple lines of evidence support a critical role of the intestine in alcohol-induced pathogenesis. Alcohol disassembles intestinal tight junctions and increases gut permeability to macromolecules. Alcohol also causes dysbiosis, an increase in pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in commensal bacteria. Consequently, alcohol increases translocation of the pathogenic bacteria and/or bacteria products and induces inflammation in multiple organs, particularly in the liver. Therefore, intestine is a major site to generate systemic factors mediating alcohol-induced organ injury. Recent studies demonstrated that reduced expression of intestinal antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) accounts for the alcohol- induced pathogenic bacteria translocation and the development of hepatitis. However, the mechanisms of how alcohol abuse induces host-microbiota dyshomeostasis remain largely unknown. The intestinal innate immune system plays a crucial role in maintaining the symbiotic balance between the host and gut microbiota by restricting the growth of pathogenic bacteria. In the past granting period, we have shown that alcohol exposure causes accumulation of acetaldehyde (AcH) not only in the liver and plasma but also in the intestinal tissues and lumen contents. The intestinal AcH levels correlated with alcohol-induced gut permeability increase and enteric dysbiosis as well as endotoxemia and hepatic inflammation. Most importantly, we demonstrated that a- defensins and lysozyme produced from the intestinal Paneth cells were reduced by alcohol exposure in association with the development of enteric and hepatic dysbiosis and hepatitis. Our findings suggest that AcH- induced Paneth cell dysfunction may represent an important mechanism underlying alcohol-induced disorders at the gut-liver axis. Paneth cells at the bottom of the intestinal crypts are professional AMP-producing innate immune cells, and the role of Paneth cell dysfunction in alcohol-induced pathogenesis at the gut-liver axis has not been defined. This project aims to determine if Paneth cell dysfunction is a crucial factor in alcohol-induced intestinal overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, gut permeability increase, bacteria/bacteria products translocation and hepatic inflammation."
"9635029","The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to elucidate the fundamental principles and mechanisms of hydrogen transfer in both protein and RNA enzyme catalysis. These objectives will be accomplished with a wide range of theoretical and computational methods, including classical molecular dynamics simulations and mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations that provide atomic-level information about Structural rearrangements and conformational motions. These calculations will probe the roles of hydrogen bonding, active site reorganization, hydrogen tunneling, active site water molecules, electrostatics, and conformational motions in both protein and RNA enzyme catalysis. These theoretical studies will be performed in close collaboration with experimental groups, assisting in the interpretation of experimental data and providing experimentally testable predictions. The protein enzyme projects will focus on soybean lipoxygenase and human DNA polymerase eta, and the RNA enzyme projects will focus on the gImS and twister ribozymes. Soybean lipoxygenase serves as a prototype for investigating hydrogen tunneling in enzymes because it exhibits unusually large hydrogen/deuterium kinetic isotope effects. Theoretical investigations of the temperature and pressure dependence of the rates and kinetic isotope effects of wild- type and mutant enzymes will provide insight into the motions that impact hydrogen tunneling. Human DNA polymerase eta enables the replication of DNA that has been damaged by exposure to ultraviolet rays, and understanding its mechanism has significant implications for skin cancer prevention and treatment. Simulations of this enzyme will provide insight into the mechanism of this biomedically important enzyme. The gImS and twister ribozymes catalyze self-cleavage reactions that are essential for modulating protein synthesis and various RNA processing reactions. Theoretical studies of these ribozymes will illuminate their mechanisms and may assist in the development of ribozymes for use as therapeutic agents to cleave pathogenic RNAs. All of these studies are relevant to public health because the resulting fundamental insights could facilitate the design of more effective drugs for a wide range of diseases. RELEVANCE (See instructions): These studies are relevant to public health because the elucidation of fundamental principles of enzyme catalysis will facilitate the design of more efficient enzymes, thereby potentially assisting in the development of more effective drugs for a broad range of diseases, including skin cancer. Insights into RNA catalysis may assist in the development of RNA enzymes for use as therapeutic agents to cleave pathogenic RNAs."
"9559177","Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is the most common cause of severe pneumonia, and, despite the existence of licensed vaccines, annually kills half of a million children under five years old worldwide. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have the intrinsic disadvantage of a limited number of serotypes against which they provide protection, resulting in disease due to serotype replacement that reduces their impact. A protein-based vaccine could be used alone or in combination with PCVs to provide protection against all pneumococcal types in low and middle income, as well as developed countries. Antigen Discovery, Inc (ADI) of Irvine, California has developed a S. pneumoniae pan-proteome microarray, with coverage of both the core and accessory geneome, which can be used to screen antibody responses against the entire pneumococcal proteome. A proteome-scale platform for antibody immune-profiling has never before been available to the pneumococcus research community, and this technology has the power to rapidly advance our understanding of the protective immune response directed to pneumococcal proteins. The Respiratory Infections Group (RIG) at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) in the U.K. has developed a unique human model, which allows for the discovery of targets of naturally acquired and vaccine induced immunity against nasal colonization with pneumococci. In the Experimental Human Pneumococcal Carriage (EHPC) model, healthy volunteers are inoculated with a pneumococcal challenge strain, and acquisition of the challenge strain (carriage-positive) or protection from it (carriage-negative), as well as immune responses before and after challenge, are determined in mucosal secretions and peripheral blood. We will use pan-proteome microarrays to measure the anti-protein IgG and IgA levels to specific proteins before bacteria inoculation and associate these responses with protection from carriage using samples from the volunteers of EHPC trials. This tool will allow us to identify novel relevant protein targets that can be exploited as a part of a multi-component or monovalent vaccine. We expect to identify >200 immunoreactive protein targets, at least 10-20 of which are significantly associated with protection. We will attempt to prioritize 10 of the most promising candidate antigens to take forward for vaccine development."
"9472569","Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making."
"9662868","PROJECT SUMMARY Infantile spasms are epileptic seizures that appear within a spectrum of infantile epileptic encephalopathies with poor prognosis. They are age-specific and have different mechanisms and pharmacosensitivity from other seizures. They have multiple etiologies, among which inflammatory processes have been implicated. An important feature of early brain development is the presence of depolarizing GABAA receptor signaling, needed for normal development, which gradually shifts to the normal hyperpolarizing GABAA receptor signaling seen in more mature ages. Using rat and mouse models of infantile spasms, we have found evidence that the presence of depolarizing GABAA receptor signaling in the setting of focal cortical inflammation, may underlie the age-specific susceptibility to inflammation-induced spasms and may predispose to a more severe phenotype. Here we investigate the interactions between depolarizing GABAA receptor signaling and inflammation that lead to age-specific expression of spasms and predispose to a more severe phenotype. We  will also investigate whether this GABA-­??inflammation interaction affects subsequent epilepsy in adulthood. We will use a combination of stereotactic surgeries, video-EEG monitoring, histology, gene and protein expression studies, in vitro electrophysiology, drug administrations to determine the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms involved and identify new candidate targets for novel treatments for infantile spasms. Our studies are expected to deliver new candidate targets for the development of new therapeutics for infantile spasms and subsequent epilepsies."
"9444464","Project 2 Summary CMV can replicate in a wide variety of cells and tissues in the host, including fibroblasts, myeloid-derived cells, endothelial cells, and a variety of epithelial cells. In the past few years we have discovered that vector tropism plays a major role in CMV vector immunogenicity and efficacy. We found that the 68-1 RhCMV/SIV vectors that are associated with stringent protection against highly pathogenic SIV challenge elicit SIV-specific CD8+ T cells that were highly unusual in their epitope targeting. Rather than recognize SIV peptides in the context of classical MHC-Ia molecules, these CD8+ T cells broadly targeted SIV epitopes presented in the context of either MHC-II or non-classical MHC-E molecules. This unusual response phenotype was found to be due to the loss of the Rh157.5 (UL128) and Rh157.4 (UL130) genes in the 68-1 RhCMV vector, as repair of these genes in the 68-1.2 RhCMV vectors reverted the vector-elicited CD8+ T cell responses back to conventional MHC-Ia restriction. Remarkably, in 2 independent experiments, these Rh157.5/Rh157.4-repaired 68-1.2 RCMV vectors, though equivalently immunogenic in terms of response magnitude and phenotype as their ?Rh157.5/Rh157.4 68-1 RhCMV vector counterparts, were found not to protect against SIV challenge, strongly suggesting that the unconventionally restricted CD8+ T cells associated with 68-1 vectors are required for efficacy. Rh157.5 and Rh157.4 are 2 essential components of the pentameric receptor complex (PRC) involved in facilitating CMV infection of non-fibroblasts. Further work demonstrated that specific loss of PRC function partially recapitulates the unconventional CD8+ T cell responses of 68-1 RhCMV vectors, resulting in vectors that elicit a mixture of MHC-II- and MHC-Ia-restricted responses. This phenotype was mimicked by PRC-independent modification of the tropism of PRC?intact RhCMV vectors using microRNA (miR)-142 restriction, which prevents vector infection of myeloid-derived cells, suggesting that absence of PRC function in RhCMV vectors (and the resultant less efficient vector infection of myeloid cells) promotes the induction of MHC-II-restricted CD8+ T cell responses. Interestingly, MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses appear to require infection of myeloid-derived cells for their generation, as MiR-142 restriction of the strain 68-1 RhCMV vector completely prevents MHC-E-restricted response priming, leaving MHC-II response priming intact. In this project, we seek to define the role of vector tropism in CMV vector CD8+ T cell response programming, and to exploit this biology to focus vector immunogenicity on the most efficacious response type. We will 1) determine how in vivo tropism of CMV vectors that differentially induce conventionally (MHC-Ia) restricted vs. unconventionally (MHC-E- and MHC-II-) restricted CD8+ T cell responses differ in infected tissues, 2) define the target cell tropism requirements for CMV vector-elicited MHC-E- and MHC-II-restricted CD8+ T cell responses using cell type-specific miRs, and 3) develop CMV vectors that preferentially or exclusively elicit MHC-E- and MHC-II-restricted CD8+ T cell responses by strategic modification of vector tropism."

"9431257","Abstract Alzheimer's disease is a fatal, progressive brain disease that deteriorates memory and cognitive ability, often starting years before the first symptoms appear. It is the most common form of dementia and the only top 10 cause of death that has no cure, no means of prevention, and no disease-modifying treatments. In this proposal we suggest a combination of novel nanostructure assembly technique based on Flexible Nano Arrays (FNA) and universal non-self vaccine platform MultiTEP for the creation of an efficient AD vaccine targeting A? dimers. This vaccine would be able to discriminate between pathological and physiological as well as toxic and inert forms of A?. This becomes especially important in the light of new evidence suggesting the functional importance of A? in neuronal plasticity and defense against brain infections. Ability to target selectively highly toxic soluble forms of A? is also important, since generation of antibodies that bind to mostly inert, fibrillar forms of A? is suboptimal due to the possibility of solubilization of plaques and release of large amounts of toxic soluble A? oligomers. Also, targeting the fibrillary forms of A? may lead to increased activation of complement in the regions with vascular amyloid deposits and induce additional adverse effects associated with vascular inflammation. The oligomeric forms of A? are highly neurotoxic and should be the primary target in AD immunotherapy, yet their structure is not well-defined and is mostly predicted based on the knowledge about the structure of fibrillar A?. Synthetic oligomeric forms of A? are transient and heterogeneous in size, therefore we hypothesize that a successful immunotherapy approach for AD needs well-defined antigens. The objective of this proposal is to develop an approach by which a flexible nanoarray will be utilized to assemble dimers of A?14-23 peptide and conjugate them with the universal and immunogenic MultiTEP platform to generate a novel vaccine targeting dimeric A?, which is considered to be a seed for the generation of other toxic forms of A?. The immunogenic efficacy and specificity of the vaccine will be tested in vivo allowing us to optimize the vaccine assembly methodology. We hypothesize that (a) combining conformational B cell epitope/s exposed on A?14-23 dimers with MultiTEP platform (dA?-MultiTEP) will allow us to generate an effective vaccine, which, after formulation in proprietary Advax/CpG adjuvant, will overcome immunogenicity limitation even in elderly people with immunosenescence; (b) dimer-specific antibodies will not only be therapeutically effective, but also safe, due to the absence of adverse events associated with solubilization of plaques and clearance of monomeric A?."
"9670320","Project Summary:  Usher Syndrome (USH), the most common genetic cause of deaf-blindness, is an incurable syndrome that results in deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and retinal degeneration leading to blindness (retinitis pigmentosa, RP). It affects 20% of infants with bilateral moderate to profound congenital sensorineural hearing loss, 15-30% of patients with RP and 50% of deaf-blind children. There are12 genes encoding for proteins essential for the proper development, maturation and survival of sensory hair cells in the cochlea and photoreceptors in the retina. USH gene mutations cause dysfunction of the entire protein network, resulting in deafness, blindness and vestibular dysfunction.  We request support for the Second International Symposium on Usher Syndrome that will bring together scientists, clinicians and USH patients and families to: 1) Promote research in emerging areas of USH diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and cure; 2) Present new research findings and develop future research strategies; (3) Promote collaboration among researchers and clinicians from different institutions and different research focus areas who study USH; (4) Educate patients/families affected by Usher Syndrome about research advances and promote collaboration between these families and USH researchers; 5) Make researchers and clinicians aware of the needs of USH patients and families to direct new research priorities.  The Second International Symposium on Usher Syndrome will be held in conjunction with the 10th Usher Syndrome Family Conference in Mainz, Germany, July 19-21, 2018. The International Usher Syndrome Symposium will convene 200-225 scientists and clinicians and 100-125 families. Days one and two will feature a scientific program that will include presentations and discussions related to genetics and diagnostics, cellular and molecular aspects of the proteins affected in the disease, animal models of Usher syndrome and advancement in research on therapies for the retinal degeneration and hearing loss. The third day will be a Family day and it will include presentations that will summarize the scientific symposium for the general audience and discuss diagnosis, cellular and molecular biology of Usher syndrome, gene therapy and clinical trials.  The Symposium will support the mission of NIDCD and NEI by focusing on uncovering and sharing new knowledge of a syndrome that affects hearing, balance and vision, and results in significant communication impairments. The Symposium will support the public health and educational missions of the NIH by including scientists, clinicians and patients/families with USH to encourage collaboration on both a formal and informal basis for all participants."
"9529231","Project Summary Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) result in substantial morbidity and mortality and add to the rising cost of health care. HAIs are increasingly caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Among the most serious HAI threats are carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Our project addresses this significant public health problem and establishes a consortium of experts in infectious disease modeling, HAI prevention, and public health practice. RTI International, UNC Health Care, and the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NC DHHS) will partner to create the North Carolina Modeling Infectious Diseases Network (NC MIND). Via NC MIND, we will conduct innovative research to realize these specific aims: (1) Build, calibrate, and validate an agent-based simulation model (ABM) of an NC regional healthcare network (HNET) and extend it to a statewide platform. We will adapt RTI's simulated population and develop an ABM of an NC regional healthcare network, extend the ABM statewide, and use the ABM to assess the impact of HAI prevention interventions. The simulated NC population provides an accurate representation of the populations' s sociodemographic attributes and locations, including households, hospitals, and long-term care facilities; (2) Link patient movement to high-risk areas for CRE and C. difficile infection within HNET, creating an NC regional healthcare network infectious disease model (HNET-ID). We will extend HNET to HNET-ID by determining the areas within a healthcare network that pose a high-risk for HAIs and developing methods that associate the probability of CRE or C. difficile infection with patient traits, hospital characteristics, and the natural history of the pathogen. We will use HNET-ID to conduct simulated epidemiologic studies of HAI prevention interventions, such as active surveillance for colonization at hospital admission and subsequent isolation of colonized patients; and (3) Assess the utility of HNET-ID in public health practice and use results to inform policy. We will conduct a demonstration project with NC DHHS to evaluate the utility of the tools we develop. We will disseminate our findings and results to public health and healthcare stakeholders through presentations and manuscripts that inform and influence public health policy. Successful completion of our project aims will build capacity for preventing CRE, C. difficile, and other emerging HAI threats by increasing understanding of the transmission dynamics of HAIs, evaluating HAI prevention interventions, developing computational tools to better understand HAI spread, and informing practices for risk identification and implementation of public health prevention and control measures."

"9626765","Understanding how intratumor phenotypic heterogeneity promotes disease progression is essential to improve patient care. In this proposal we focus on the cooperative relationships between distinct tumor subpopula- tions, which are a critical yet poorly understood property of heterogeneity within tumors. We have recently uncovered a new symbiotic relationship between tumors subpopulations that promotes a transition from be- nign to malignant growth by inducing the collective invasion of cohesive groups of cells. Through analysis of the intrinsic heterogeneity within cell communities, we discovered an epigenetically distinct subpopulation of breast cancer ?trailblazer? cells that has an enhanced ability to initiate collective invasion. Importantly, sibling ?opportunist? cells can invade through paths in the ECM created by a minority subpopulation of trailblazer cells. This democratization of invasive behavior through subpopulation cooperation eliminates a bottleneck in tumor evolution, thus unleashing the metastatic potential of a more diverse tumor cell population. We have begun uncovering components of a unique multi-gene regulatory program that is specifically required for trail- blazer cell induced collective invasion and found evidence that it is active in patients with shorter survival times. Thus, we have revealed that the activation of a new signaling network in a subpopulation of cells can induce the formation of a novel cooperative relationship that yields widespread collective invasion and has the potential to negatively impact patient survival. Defining factors that control this new ?trailblazer? regulatory program and determining precisely how the interaction between trailblazer and opportunist cells contributes to cancer progression is necessary to explain how cooperative invasive behavior influences patient prognosis and reveal treatment options. Our overall objective in this proposal is to define how trailblazer and opportunist subpopulations influence tumor development. Our central hypothesis is that slow-cycling trailblazer cells in- duce metastasis by promoting the opportunistic invasion of a distinct subpopulation of metastasis initiating cells that lacks autonomous invasive ability. We will test our hypothesis and accomplish our objectives by: (1) defining factors that control the conversion between opportunist and trailblazer states; (2) determining how induction of the trailblazer state influences cell autonomous fitness and (3) determining how the cooperative relationship established between trailblazer and opportunist subpopulations contributes to metastasis. From our investigation, we expect to determine a new way in which heterogeneity promotes tumor development by revealing how the cancer hallmarks of proliferation and autonomous invasion can be distributed across distinct populations and shared in a synergistic relationship that promotes disease progression. These findings will support the development of a new mode of prognostic analysis directed towards identifying the presence and close spatial proximity of unique tumor cell subtypes. Deconstruction of processes that confer invasive ability through intercellular interactions may also uncover novel ways to thwart invasion."
"9573451","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The heart senses the changing mechanical load and adjusts the contractile strength, on a beat-to-beat basis, to match the load in order to effectivel pump blood into circulation. High blood pressure often leads to arrhythmias and heart diseases. Defects in structural proteins, such as in muscular dystrophy, can also lead to cardiomyopathy. How do the cardiomyocytes sense and respond to mechanical forces? What molecules serve as mechanosensors? What are the signaling pathways that transduce mechanical stress to biochemical reactions in the cell? All these important questions need to be answered by investigating the mechano-chemo- transduction (MCT) mechanisms at cellular and molecular levels. A major hindrance to studying MCT mechanisms is a lack of technology to achieve two important capabilities: one is to control mechanical stress at the single cell level in 3-D environment mimicking the myocardium; the other is to tug on specific cell-surface mechanosensors during myocyte contraction in order to interrogate their role in MCT. However, all currently available techniques come short of having both capabilities. In this project, the PI and her interdisciplinary team will combine synthetic chemistry, muscle mechanics, and cellular and molecular biology to achieve two major goals: one is the bioengineering goal to develop an innovative `Cell-in-Gel' system that have the above two capabilities; the other is the scientific goal of using the new tools to investigate the MCT mechanisms during cardiomyocyte contraction under mechanical load. The Cell-in-Gel system has two major advantages over existing techniques (stretching cells using carbon fibers or glass rods). (1) Live cardiomyocytes are embedded in a 3-D hydrogel (elastic matrix composed of crosslinking polymers) so they experience 3-D mechanical stresses (longitudinal tension, transverse compression, shear stress) during contraction, mimicking the in vivo environment. (2) The gel chemistry allows tethering specific cell-surface mechanosensors (e.g. dystroglycans, integrins) to the gel matrix to impose mechanical stress on them during cell contraction. The Cell-in-Gel system will enable scientists to study MCT complexes, their downstream signaling, and functional consequences in live cardiomyocytes and other cell types. We will test the central hypothesis that two major MCT complexes in cardiomyocytes-the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and the vinculin-talin-integrin complex (VTI)- transduce mechanical stress to modulate the Ca2+ signaling system on a beat-to-beat basis, which enhances Ca2+ transient and contractility in response to mechanical load, but this same mechanism can also cause Ca2+ dysregulation under excessive load. Resolving this MCT mechanism is fundamental to understanding how the heart responds to mechanical load to autoregulate contractility, how excessive loads cause heart diseases, and how DGC mutations in muscular dystrophy lead to Ca2+ dysregulation and cardiac dysfunction."
"9459431","Mitochondrial dynamics, manifest as ability of mitochondria to change morphology and motility, play a vital role in neuronal response to fluctuating energy demands. Impairment of mitochondrial dynamics contributes to different disorders such as Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s, and Huntington?s diseases (HD). In HD, interaction of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) with dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) results in an increased Drp1 activity, leading to augmented mitochondrial fission, accompanied by reduced mitochondrial traffic. Despite significant effort, the molecular mechanisms, leading to mHtt-induced changes in mitochondrial morphology and motility are not completely understood. In preliminary experiments, we found that CRMP2, a protein implicated in axon guidance and regulation of neurite outgrowth, regulates mitochondrial dynamics. A mechanistic link between CRMP2 and regulation of mitochondrial dynamics has never been investigated. CRMP2 binds to neuronal mitochondria and in its dephosphorylated form to mHtt. CRMP2 physically interacts with Drp1, Mitofusin 2, and Miro 2, proteins involved in regulation of mitochondrial fission, fusion, and motility, respectively. Downregulation of CRMP2 with siRNA leads to increased fission and reduced mitochondrial traffic, implicating CRMP2 in regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. CRMP2 hyperphosphorylation after inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A correlates with augmented fission and reduced mitochondrial traffic. Conversely, decreasing CRMP2 phosphorylation can prevent these alterations. Finally, we found CRMP2 downregulation and hyperphosphorylation in striatal tissues from YAC128 HD mouse model and in postmortem striatal tissues of HD patients. Overall, the literature and our preliminary data strongly suggest that CRMP2 is involved in regulation of mitochondrial morphology and motility and CRMP2 hyperphosphorylation contributes to HD pathogenesis leading to excessive fission, reduced mitochondrial traffic, and neuronal loss. Dephosphorylated CRMP2 binds to mHtt and to proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and reduces their activities, whereas CRMP2 downregulation and hyperphosphorylation disrupts these protein-protein interactions, liberates binding partners of CRMP2, and increases their activities. In Aim 1, we will determine CRMP2 localization in mitochondria, establish protein interaction partners, and assess the extent to which CRMP2 regulates mitochondrial dynamics in neurons. In Aim 2, the mechanisms of CRMP2-medited regulation of mitochondrial dynamics will be determined. In Aim 3, we will establish CRMP2-mediated mechanisms contributing to defects of mitochondrial dynamics and cell death in human neurons expressing mHtt. Finally, in Aim 4, we will assess to what extent CRMP2 dephosphorylation alters protein-protein interactions, protects neurons, and corrects behavioral deficits in animal models of HD. The proposed study will considerably improve our understanding of HD pathophysiology, lay a solid foundation for identifying new mechanisms of HD pathogenesis, and open novel avenues in HD research."
"9561979","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) exhibit aggressive tumor biology and carry a poor prognosis, particularly in premenopausal African American (AA) women who carry a disproportionate burden of breast cancer mortality. The precursor lesion for TNBC is poorly characterized and the pathophysiology of TNBC is not well understood so therapies often fail to achieve complete pathological response and the disease is frequently non-curative. This proposal aims to clarify the molecular pathology of TNBC so that biomarkers for early diagnosis, prevention strategies and curative therapies can be developed. In our high-risk, multi-institutional cohort, with a high percent of AA women, we found that during breast cancer initiation, pStat3 is high as is ECM stiffness and integrin/YAP mechanosignaling, and miRNAs implicated in tumor progression/aggression. TNBCs had the highest inflammation, pStat3 and miR-18a, the stiffest ECM and the lowest miR-203. Mouse studies indicated preventing inflammation decreases fibrosis and that reducing ECM stiffening lower pStat3 and inflammation and EMT and metastasis. Driving mammary mechanosignaling induced miR-18a and EMT and enhanced tumor aggression/metastasis. This suggests that an activated Stat3/tissue tension feedback loop, linked to tissue inflammation, promotes TNBC by engaging mechanosignaling pathways that alter miRs and induce an EMT and tumor aggression. While some breast cancers arise from focal lesions, TNBCs often appear to arise diffusely. We predict that in women at high-risk for TNBC (familial association, BRCA1 mutation) there is a dynamic and reciprocal relationship between the at risk epithelium and tissue tension that activates mechano-signaling pathways and induces Stat3/miRNA to 1) initiate TNBC, 3) induce an EMT and/or enhance tumor aggression, that 3) can be used to idenify precancerous lesions that have a high likelihood of progression to TNBC, and 4) could be used to monitor efficacy of prevention strategies and identify targets to improve TNBC treatment. We will use preclinical models to test: 1) if there is a reciprocal relationship between inflammation, pStat3 and tissue tension that promotes TNBC progression/aggression and 2) if this is mediated through miRs and EMT. We will examine a clinical cohort of high risk women who rapidly develop TNBCs to 3) test the prevalence of this signaling circuit in biopsies from women with TNBC and determine whether these biomarkers can identify precancerous lesions that have a high likelihood of progression to TNBC. Significance: Our studies could transform concepts of breast cancer by demonstrating that tissue tension could molecularly-prime tissue to malignancy. Markers that identify preneoplastic changes in TNBC, that could be used to monitor efficacy of risk reduction strategies, would have a transformative impact on TNBC mortality rates and particularly AA women."
"9454813","The foreign body response (FBR) represents a major challenge in the application and clinical success of current and future biomaterial-based treatments of musculoskeletal injuries and diseases. The FBR is orchestrated by macrophages and occurs ubiquitously to all implanted non-biological materials. Although the mechanisms driving the FBR remain to be elucidated, it is generally understood the FBR is initiated by inflammatory cells that recognize the material as foreign through surface-adsorbed proteins, which can unfold, exposing epitopes known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These DAMPs are directly influenced by the highly dynamic and heterogeneous behavior of proteins in near-surface environments, including transient unfolding and refolding, rapid exchange of folded and unfolded protein molecules between the surface and bulk solution, and intermittent diffusion on the surface. While such interfacial processes are likely involved in the FBR, their roles have been all but ignored due to the lack of experimental techniques to directly observe these processes. The overarching aim of this research is to investigate the extent to which interfacial protein dynamics influences the presence of DAMPs using novel single-molecule (SM) biophysical methods, which are uniquely sensitive to interfacial protein dynamics. Such methods will be combined with poly(ethylene glycol)/poly(sulfobetaine) copolymer brushes that are tuned to control interfacial dynamic behavior of proteins, in vitro macrophage activation assays, and in vivo mouse studies to elucidate the role of surface-induce protein unfolding in the FBR. We will test the hypothesis that the presentation of unfolded proteins (i.e., DAMPs) as a result of the complex and heterogeneous behavior of proteins in near-surface environments triggers macrophage activation via toll like receptor (TLR) signaling and contributes to the FBR. In particular, toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of membrane proteins that are involved in innate immune signaling; and specifically, TLR2 and 4 have been shown to recognize host proteins acting as DAMPs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will confirm the role of TLR2/4 signaling in the activation of macrophages to known DAMPs (Aim 1.1) and identify the dynamic behaviors that lead to the presentation of unfolded proteins and in turn to macrophage activation (Aim 1.2). In Aim 2, the amount of transient unfolded protein will be further correlated to the FBR in vivo via TLR2/4 signaling using knockout mouse models. Combined, these aims will 1) identify that transient unfolded proteins contribute to macrophage activation and the FBR via TLR2/4 signaling and 2) elucidate the mechanisms by which near surface environments influence transient protein unfolding. These new insights will provide the foundation for new research aimed at designing novel chemistries that control complex protein dynamics and thus we may, for the first time, be able to prevent protein unfolding at surfaces and potentially eliminate the FBR."
"9444495","Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a ?scanner-to-clinician? platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease."
"9539147","PROJECT SUMMARY: Although human in vitro fertilization (IVF) was introduced over 35 years ago as a means to assist infertile couples in conceiving a child, the average live birth rate per IVF cycle is still only ~30-35% (cdc.gov/art). A primary contributor to IVF failure are whole chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidy) that occur during pre- implantation embryo development. Using high-resolution genomic techniques, it was recently shown that ~50- 80% of cleavage-stage human embryos have one or more chromosomally abnormal cells. These aneuploid embryos often display phenomena known as cellular fragmentation and micronucleation, which we hypothesize are corrective mechanisms to aid in restoring proper chromosome numbers. To improve our understanding of why these abnormalities occur and uncover solutions to ameliorate their impact on IVF success, animal models with pre-implantation development closely resembling humans are needed. Besides rarely containing micronuclei and cellular fragments, mouse embryos also exhibit considerably less aneuploidy than humans at ~1-15%, and therefore, do not make a good model for studying these processes. Therefore, this proposal seeks to investigate the use of a bovine model, which shares several key aspects of early embryogenesis with humans, to increase our understanding of human embryonic aneuploidy. The first aim of these studies will determine the exact aneuploidy frequency in cleavage-stage bovine embryos by combining next generation DNA-sequencing of single blastomeres and cellular fragments with time-lapse monitoring (TLM) of pre-implantation development. In Aim II, fragmented versus non-fragmented bovine embryos will be assessed by RNA-sequencing following TLM to identify gene expression changes resulting from, and contributing to, aneuploidy for functional analysis. Aim III will investigate the role of BUB1B, a mitotic checkpoint protein important for mediating normal blastomere divisions and nuclear structure in our preliminary data, and/or other genes identified from Aim II via morpholino microinjection. Gene expression changes in BUB1B deficient embryos will be assessed to determine the effect of knockdown on chromosome segregation and maintenance during early mitosis. Completion of the proposed studies will allow us to unravel the precise relationship between embryonic cleavage divisions, cellular fragmentation, micronucleation, and aneuploidy as well as increase our understanding of the molecular pathways mediating normal pre-implantation development. These studies will contribute valuable findings to our long term goal of identifying and avoiding chromosomal abnormalities associated with early embryo loss for increased IVF success."
"9482409","Overall abstract Our Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution) will develop a suite of systems-based methodologies to understand how genomic diversity, clonal evolution, and phenotypic change  . To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer"

Promote translational science workforce development by providing outstanding predoctoral and post-doctoral clinical and T1-T4 translational research training. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT 2. Develop tailored learning opportunities for trainees interested in T1-T4 CTR and diversify programmatic opportunities to include an emphasis on interdisciplinary professional skill training. We will provide competency-based, individualized development plans, online (on-demand) coursework, externships, and community engagement opportunities for trainees from multiple disciplines. New externships in dissemination and implementation, entrepreneurship, innovation, and commercialization will diversify TL1 programmatic opportunities. INTEGRATION 3. Implement innovative methods for tracking and evaluation of TL1 programs, trainees, and alumna and use this data for program improvement and to measure the changing culture of ICTS research teams. We will implement the TL1 Evaluation Logic Model, a tool-based analytic approach, to evaluate engagement in, understanding of, and satisfaction with programmatic offerings. METHODS & PROCESSES 4. Increase interactions between the TL1 faculty, trainees, and fellows with stakeholders, other ICTS functions, ICTS partners, and CTSA hubs. We will leverage resources, share best practices, and create learning communities across disciplines to foster patient and community-centered translational research and training at local, regional, and national levels. COLLABORATION & ENGAGEMENT 5. Provide high-quality, comprehensive informatics training. Through the new WU Institute for Informatics and our ICTS partners, we will offer new courses, certificates and degree programs in Informatics. We will integrate informatics methods, tools, and skills into all of our courses and training programs. INFORMATICS Completion of these aims will result in increased numbers of diverse, well-trained investigators who will lead multidisciplinary teams. Consistent with national CTSA goals, successful completion of our goals will expand the workforce of MDs, PhDs, MD/PhDs, and DVMs equipped with high-quality CTR training that can advance discovery science through the translational spectrum to improve human health."
