"9479236","PROJECT SUMMARY Cytochrome P450s (P450s) are oxidases involved in a wide variety of synthetic and metabolic biochemical reactions in organisms throughout the kingdoms of life. Importantly, P450s are the central enzymes of drug metabolism. Despite similar structures and catalytic mechanisms, P450 homologs vary greatly in their specificity for and catalytic selectivity on different substrates, and these differences can have critical therapeutic consequences. A major obstacle in predicting P450 reactivity on any given substrate is our incomplete understanding of the involvement of protein dynamics - the population of multiple states and their interconversion - in the mechanisms of regioselectivity. Specifically, the population of multiple bound states could orient multiple parts of the substrate with respect to the reactive intermediate compound I and lead to multiple products. In addition, flexibility of the active site within one bound state could permit multiple positions of the substrate to approach the reactive compound I intermediate during its lifetime. Experimentally testing these possibilities is however challenging due to the complex, heterogeneous nature of the proteins and the contribution of motion on very fast timescales to protein flexibility. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy can resolve protein conformations and dynamics that interconvert on even the fastest timescales and, furthermore, 2D techniques can quantify conformational heterogeneity, as well as the frequency fluctuation amplitudes and timescales with which they are sampled. When combined with the spatial precision provided by site-selective labeling with IR probes, the approach should enable unprecedented description of the energy landscapes of P450s. This application is directed at three P450s which vary in flexibility: P450cam, 3A4, and 2C9 and their complexes with substrates that are hydroxylated with differing levels of regioselectivity. Measurement and comparison of the dynamics of the substrate complexes will provide information for evaluating how dynamics are involved in their different activity. The new information about P450s will advance our understanding of the biophysical mechanisms that underlie enzyme function, as well as improve our ability to predict P450 activity on a given molecule, and thus develop better drugs with improved pharmacokinetics."
"9458038","PROJECT SUMMARY Glioblastoma is highly resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy. Despite treatment, median survival is only 12-15 months. Tumor cells rely upon elevated stress response pathways to survive and maintain a rapid proliferative rate in the harsh tumor microenvironment. Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are particularly enriched in their ability to survive in the context of nutrient deprivation, high reactive oxygen species, DNA damage and radiation. Upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the unfolded proteins response (UPR) promote cell survival during stress. These pathways are elevated in glioblastoma and knockdown induces chemosensitivity and cell death. The UPR specifically relieves ER stress, a key pathway of radiation-induced cell death. I have identified RSAD1 as a potential regulator of the UPR and thus a novel dependency in GSCs. There are currently no published studies characterizing the function of RSAD1. RSAD1 is upregulated in glioblastoma and is correlated with worse survival, and my preliminary evidence demonstrates that RSAD1 knockdown significantly impairs proliferation in GSCs. I found that RSAD1 binding partners enrich for UPR regulators and HSPs. The goal of this research is to test the hypothesis that RSAD1 promotes survival in GSCs through activation of the UPR. Given the important role of the UPR in inducing stress resilience, inhibition of RSAD may act as a chemo- or radiosensitizer of GSCs, in addition to independently impairing proliferation. RSAD1 may therefore be a novel target for synergistic therapy in glioblastoma."

NRG Oncology (or NRG) has leveraged the tremendous resources, leadership, membership, and history of practice-defining research of the three legacy groups to create a modern clinical and translational research organization with the capability to execute clinical and translational research trials for adult patients with common and rare malignancies in the following disease sites: Gynecologic Cancer (including Ovarian, Cervix and Endometrial Cancer); Brain Tumors (Primary and Secondary); Breast Cancer; Gastrointestinal Cancers (Colorectal and Non-Colorectal Cancers); Genitourinary Cancer; Head and Neck Cancer; and Lung Cancer. NRG will be the leading network group defining new standards of care and scientific paradigms for several of these disease sites. For these seven cancer disease sites, NRG will primarily conduct trials for patients with early or intermediate stage cancers testing innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including novel imaging, radiation oncology, and surgical approaches; the integration of novel systemic agents or classes of systemic agents with optimized loco-regional therapies and existing systemic therapies, and the use of biomarker- and biologic pathway-defined approaches to risk stratification, investigational therapy assignment, and clinical trial decision-making. The group has seven scientific core committees and four integrated committees which provide both scientific support and generate protocols: Developmental Therapeutics (DT), Translational Science, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research, and Cancer Prevention and Control Committees. NRG's DT Committee builds on the GOG DT Committee's success in enrolling over 500 patients/year on early phase trials leading to phase III trials. The NRG Operations Center is fully aligned with NRG Oncology Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) and the NRG Biorepositories and will be fully compliant with all NCI regulations and proactive in improving the efficiency and quality of its research. The group will serve as a scientific resource for other NCTN network groups for radiation oncology innovation through its Center for Innovative Radiation Oncology (CIRO)."
"9643884","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A number of treatments have been developed to treat articulatory deficits in acquired apraxia of speech (AOS). One such intervention is sound production treatment (SPT), which employs a response-contingent hierarchy made up of verbal modeling/repetition, graphic cueing, integral stimulation, and articulatory placement instruction. Interventions such as SPT are generally found to improve patients' speech accuracy but to varying degrees. In the current study, we will test the hypothesis that lesion site plays a role in the variability of SPT response. We will use state-of-the-art MRI imaging and post-processing techniques to better understand which patients are best able to benefit from AOS treatment, as well as the neural changes underlying treatment effects. Specifically, we will use voxel-based lesion symptom mapping to identify lesion sites most predictive of the degree of treatment response and advanced diffusion imaging techniques to map changes in the integrity of white matter tracts from pre- to post-treatment. To do this, we will recruit 30 individuals with AOS from the VA Northern California patient populations over the course of four years, using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will be scanned on a 3T MRI scanner on the VA Martinez campus. Structural MRI and diffusion imaging sequences will be collected at three time points: before and after the baseline phase of treatment (to measure scan-rescan reliability prior to treatment) and again following treatment (to measure the neural changes associated with treatment). Treatment will be delivered by licensed speech-language pathologists familiar with this patient population and trained on the sound production treatment protocol. Patients will be trained on three different sounds (e.g., consonant, vowel sounds) that produce error rates >70% on pre-testing. Test stimuli will include both trained and untrained sounds to test for generalizability. To identify brin regions predictive of response to the SPT treatment, we will run voxel-based lesion symptom mapping analyses on normalized lesion reconstructions, with the independent variable being lesion status (lesioned or not) and the dependent variable, the change in sound production accuracy, with separate analyses for trained and untrained items. Based on our previous work and the relevant literature, we predict that the size of the SPT response (effect size) for both treated and untreated items will be affected by lesions involving the left superior pre-central gyrus of the insula. Next, diffusion imaging-derived tractography will be used to reconstruct eight major white matter pathways, and fractional anisotropy values will be calculated for specific regions of interest in each pathway. The degree of treatment response to both trained and untrained stimuli is predicted to correlate with fractional anisotropy values in the white matter surrounding the superior pre-central gyrus of the insula, the left arcuate, superior longitudinal, and medial subcallosal fasciculi, as these tracts have been implicated in studies of fluency and motor speech disorders. To measure neuroplasticity associated with the SPT protocol, we will calculate the difference in fractional anisotropy values from Scan 2 to 3 for each of the eight fiber tracts. Our predictions again focus on those tracts that have been directly associated with speech production in the literature, the arcuate, superior longitudinal, and medial subcallosal fasciculi, and fibers of the extreme capsule. In short, the current proposal is significant in thatit addresses a large gap in the literature with respect to prospectively identifying specific grey and white matter correlates that predict AOS treatment response, as well as the neural mechanisms underlying such treatment. The proposed project will improve our scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying speech-language treatment and provide clinicians with critical information that they can use to improve patient care."

"9468139","Use of e-cigarettes (E-cigs), known as ?vaping?, is becoming widely adopted amongst adolescents who are attracted by their novelty, synthetic flavors, and belief of reduced toxicity. Previous smokers also use E-cigs as a smoking cessation tool that is an alternative nicotine delivery system with milder social stigma. However, ?vaping? is an emerging public health problem, especially concerning young people with no smoking history, due to the lack of informative respiratory studies on E-cig vapor components. Past inhaled nicotine studies examined its effects mainly on airway smooth muscle and the central nervous system as opposed to the ciliated airway epithelia, the major barrier for inhaled E-cig vapor, and few studies investigated nicotine in isolation of tobacco smoke constituents. Additionally, toxicology studies of most E-cig flavorings were never completed for inhalation exposure. This research proposal, which doubles as a mentored postdoctoral training plan, aims to elucidate effects of E-cig vapor on the functional human ciliated airway epithelium.  The airway epithelium expresses several isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel member A1 (TRPA1), and other TRP channels, which are all calcium (Ca2+)-permeant. Nicotine is reported to stimulate both nAChRs and TRPA1, and some E-cig flavors are TRP agonists, such as cinnamaldehyde (TRPA1), vanillin (TRPV1), and menthol (TRPM8). The basic hypothesis of this proposal is that E-cig vapor components nicotine and cinnamaldehyde compromise mucociliary function by stimulating nAChRs and TRPA1 to cause sustained Ca2+ influx. Research goals for this study are to identify a molecular mechanism(s) for how E-cig vapor impairs mucociliary function and to develop novel high-throughput methodology for establishing continuous mucociliary transport in vitro. The latter will be used to probe adverse/therapeutic effects of aerosolized compounds. These goals will be tested in primary human bronchial epithelial cells differentiated at the air-liquid interface, using physiologically-relevant exposures, and measuring in vitro parameters of mucociliary function such as mucociliary transport, ciliary beating, and airway surface hydration. Training goals for this proposal are to develop expertise in studying pulmonary effects of inhaled toxicants and to become immersed in translational research by working in a diverse team composed of clinicians and scientists.  Completion of this study will fulfill the unmet need for clarification and information regarding effects of inhaled nicotine and E-cig flavorings. Use of relevant exposures and primary cultures will provide a compelling biological rationale to adapt public health policy. It will also inform clinicians on the `pro & cons' of E-cigs as smoking cessation tools as well as the impact on young never-smoking subjects who take up ?vaping?. Lastly, completion of this training plan will generate data and expertise necessary for career transition from postdoctoral trainee to independent investigator."
"9541672","Project summary: Retroviruses such as HIV are detrimental to mankind, killing and infecting millions globally. An essential protein for replication and maturation of retroviruses are aspartate proteases (Pr). These proteases are symmetric dimers, where each monomer contributes a beta hairpin flap that acts as a gatekeeper for substrates to the active sites. Currently there are 9 protease inhibitors approved by the FDA to treat HIV, but none exist to treat non HIV retroviruses. All 9 approved protease inhibitors are active site inhibitors, developed by optimizing non- bonded interactions with amino acids in the active site. Unfortunately drug resistant mutants exist for all 9 active site inhibitors. To combat drug resistance, researchers have focused on developing new inhibition strategy that target non-active site residues in retroviral proteases. Using MD simulations and EPR experiments, we showed that the mechanism of substrate binding in HIV-1 Pr requires flap opening and partial dissociation of the dimer interface, leading to a transient, solvent exposed pocket. We refer to this state as a partially dissociated dimer, because the interleaved beta sheet termini accounting for 75 % of dimer stabilizing energy is still intact. Our goal is to screen for small molecules that can perturb flap dynamics and active site geometry by binding into the solvent exposed pocket in the dimer interface of retroviral proteases. Our central hypothesis is that a small molecule can bind in the pocket and allosterically prevent flap closure. Our rationale is once the flaps remain open, the active site geometry will be incorrect for binding of the natural substrate, resulting in decreased catalytic efficiency of the protease. To test our hypothesis, we will use MD simulations to characterize the dimer interface pocket of multiple sequences of HIV-1 proteases. Although the dimer interface is conserved we will like to investigate the effects of current clinical MDR mutations on pocket formation and geometry (Aim 1). Next, we will investigate whether our allosteric mechanism of inhibition is also relevant to non HIV-1 proteases, since using active site inhibitors can be challenging due to differences in substrate recognition across retroviral proteases. We will use HTLV-1 Pr and rous sarcoma virus Pr to characterize in detail their opening mechanism/partial dissociation, which is currently unknown (AIM 2). Finally, we will computationally screen allosteric inhibitors that can stabilize the inactive open flap conformations by binding to the dimer interface pocket in retroviral proteases (Aim 3). The probability of developing drug resistance to our inhibitors will be smaller than for current inhibitors since this region is highly conserved to preserve functionally important dynamics (substrate entry). Conclusion of our work will provide: 1) a new inhibition strategy, details on a druggable pocket, and small molecule candidates to combat MDR in retroviral proteases, and 2) atomistic detail on the opening mechanism of non HIV-1 proteases to assess the feasibility of targeting them with a similar allosteric inhibition strategy to what we will document for HIV-1 protease."
"9613367","PROJECT SUMMARY Light is a profoundly important regulator of physiology and behavior across a wide range of organisms. Despite its importance for influencing physiology and behavior, the circuits by which light information is relayed from the eye to the brain to influence behavior are not well understood. The central goal of this proposal is to genetically map the circuits underlying vision by focusing on the connectivity and influence of the relay neurons of the retina, the retinal ganglion cells. We will use mouse genetics to identify the influence of specific retinal ganglion cell subtypes on behavior, investigate the influence of these retinal ganglion cells on signaling within visual nuclei, and map the connectivity of retinal ganglion cells in the brain at the cellular level. These studies will enhance our understanding of visual processing and have the potential to better inform our understanding and treatment of dysfunction and injury of the visual system to better improve human health."
"9414454","PROJECT 1  Abstract  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is associated with poor food environments, which are characterized by limited  access to affordable healthy foods. Such environments are extremely common in American Indian communities,  yet, few studies have addressed food environments or food policies in Native communities. Retail food  interventions that can expand access to healthy foods and stimulate community demand for healthier choices  have shown promise in addressing CVD risk among American Indians. Citizens of the Chickasaw Nation, an  Oklahoma tribe that is the 13th largest in the US, experience a disproportionate burden of CVD risk, along with  substantial barriers to healthy eating. In 2014, 80% of almost 20,000 adult patients in the Chickasaw tribal health  system had pre-hypertension or hypertension, while 84% were overweight or obese and 13% had diabetes. In  collaboration with the Chickasaw Nation, we designed the Chickasaw Healthy Eating Environments in Retail  Stores (CHEERS) study. This multilevel intervention will be conducted over 24 months in partnership with the  first full-service, Chickasaw-owned supermarket, which will open in 2017. CHEERS comprises several mutually  reinforcing strategies to improve blood pressure control in people with hypertension. We will implement CHEERS  in the Chickasaw town of Ada, Oklahoma, while designating 2 other Chickasaw towns ? Sulphur and Tishomingo,  Oklahoma ? as the control sites, since both lack a tribally-run supermarket. We will recruit 700 adults (350 per  arm) with diagnosed hypertension and collect survey and clinical data at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months to  assess the effects of CHEERS on blood pressure control and secondary outcomes (food purchasing, diet, and  body mass index). Tribal members with uncontrolled hypertension will receive cookbooks featuring heart-healthy  recipes tailored to traditional Chickasaw diets and culture, along with invitations to attend the healthy cooking  demonstrations. During the intervention, a tribal media team will collect material to create a documentary film on  its implications for public health and the local economy. The documentary will be disseminated to tribal leaders,  who we will subsequently survey and interview to assess their readiness to implement CHEERS more widely.  CHEERS will culminate in a multimedia presentation detailing the supermarket-based intervention and featuring  personal success stories by hypertensive community members. Our Specific Aims are: 1) at the environmental  level, to collect data on the availability, price, and shelf space devoted to healthy and less healthy options in  existing local retail outlets at baseline (before the intervention) and again at 12 and 24 months; 2) at the  individual level, to measure change in blood pressure and secondary outcomes among hypertensive  community members at baseline and again at 12 and 24 months; and 3) at the policy level, to evaluate the  documentary?s effect on tribal leaders? readiness to implement CHEERS across the Chickasaw Nation and other  tribal communities. This study builds on preliminary data, best practices, established partnerships, and existing  tribal resources to maximize the likelihood of success. Study findings and multimedia materials will provide much-  needed evidence for tribally-run food interventions and will assist tribal nations in reducing CVD-related  disparities by improving healthy food access."
"9674288","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S., major birth defects impact the morbidity and mortality of tens of thousands of children annually. An environmental exposure (broadly defined) or causal gene variant is estimated to explain only about one-third of all major defects that occur. Since 1996, the Iowa Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention (CBDRP) has played a leadership role in surveillance and research of major birth defects. Our partnership with the Iowa Registry for Congenital and Inherited Disorders provides timely and comprehensive active surveillance of each in-state delivery. Our partnership with the Iowa Department of Public Health provides outreach to families in all 99 Iowa counties. These partnerships have also allowed us to successfully enroll mothers in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) and related studies to collect environmental exposure and biological data. Using these data, we have made substantial contributions to birth defects epidemiology, ranging from methods development to identification of gene-environmental interaction effects. This work has provided critical insights into the etiology of several major birth defects and has been disseminated in high-impact journals. We propose to expand the work of the Iowa CBDRP through successful participation in the Birth Defects Study To Evaluate Pregnancy Exposures (BD-STEPS). Our overall goal is to identify modifiable maternal exposures in early pregnancy that may increase the risk for having a pregnancy affected by certain major, structural birth defects. We will conduct comprehensive and timely data collection and reporting for the BD-STEPS using our established and experienced surveillance and research infrastructure. We will also extend interdisciplinary collaborations to national and international scientists to increase dissemination of NBDPS and BD-STEPS findings in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals. Our proposed research activities will use a scaffold approach for risk factor identification, by simultaneously examining environmental exposures and gene variants from discovery to confirmation to interaction. In particular, we will continue our high-impact etiological studie of orofacial clefts and craniosynostosis, and expand them to additional craniofacial and musculoskeletal defects. NBDPS and BD-STEPS data, along with those from independent populations provided by our collaborators, will offer rich resources for analyses of environmental exposures, genes, and gene-environmental interaction effects. Additionally, we will continue our leadership role and expand our training program to develop junior investigators in birth defects research. Along with pre-doctoral students, we will train clinical and research post- doctoral scholars in interdisciplinary team science for birth defects research. This research will encompass methodological, etiological, and translational studies. With our scientific expertise and highly experienced infrastructure, we are well-positioned to successfully complete our proposed research and training. Research findings generated will be used for family education, improvements in treatment, and application of prevention strategies and training activities will contribute to the next generation of birth defect researchers."
"9541125","Project Summary. Anxiety disorders affect more than 40 million Americans and represent a major public health burden. The predictability of threat plays a significant role in theoretical models of anxiety disorders and is an important distinguishing factor between the emotional states of fear and anxiety. Fear is associated with imminent, present threat whereas anxiety is associated with unpredictable, future threat. This distinction is reflected in the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative as ?acute? and ?potential? threat, respectively. The extant literature has implicated intolerance of uncertainty (IU), or fear of the unknown, as an important individual difference variable associated with increased response to unpredictable threat. Further, IU is considered a transdiagnostic risk factor for the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders, with recent work suggesting that IU may be one of the fundamental fears underlying anxiety and neuroticism. A key focus of the NIMH RDoC initiative is to identify and integrate risk factors for mental disorders with neural and/or psychophysiological indictors or biomarkers. The No Predictable Unpredictable (NPU) threat paradigm is an experimental task designed to distinguish the constructs of fear and anxiety by examining neural/physiological measures in response to threat with predictable or unpredictable timing. Although much of the work on IU and unpredictable threat has focused on self-report data, recent research has found associations between IU and psychophysiological responses to unpredictable threat (i.e., startle) using the NPU-threat task. Despite these findings, research has not examined whether psychophysiological response to unpredictable threat can be mitigated and whether changes in sensitivity to unpredictable threat mediate changes in IU across time. The proposed study will 1) examine sensitivity/responding to unpredictable threat across multiple psychophysiological measures using the NPU-threat task, 2) investigate the ability of each psychophysiological measure to predict individual differences in IU, 3) examine whether an IU-focused intervention alters IU and psychophysiological measures of sensitivity to unpredictable threat, and 4) test the specificity of these relationships in comparison to predictable threat using the NPU-threat task. Responding to unpredictable threat will be assessed using startle and event related potentials (ERPs) to startle probes (i.e., N100 and P300 to startle probes). Seventy participants will undergo a baseline appointment/psychophysiological assessment (High IU N = 50; Low IU N = 20). Following baseline, all individuals will be randomly assigned and undergo a validated1 active or control IU intervention. Participants will also complete a week one (W1) and month one (M1) psychophysiological assessment. Finally, participants will complete self-report measures during their baseline, intervention, W1, and M1 appointments. The most important aspects of this proposal will be in the training that the primary investigator (PI) receives. This training will provide the PI with the necessary skills to integrate psychophysiological research into future work and design and conduct effective clinical trials."

Quarles, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, The Optical Society  2010 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, DC  gquarles@osa.org, 202-416-1954 Project Summary /Abstract:  The 2018 OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics, 3-6 April 2018, Hollywood, FL, consists of four topical meetings. Three of these meetings, Microscopy, Histopathology and Analytics; Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy; and Clinical and Translational Biophotonics provide broad exposure to a very active multidisciplinary field in bio-optics and biophotonics focused on cancer research with direct medical applications. The interdisciplinary nature of the co-located meetings will provide cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between fields with the resulting synergies obtained from such interactions. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students, early career professionals, and underrepresented speakers that will present on cancer related topic areas within the three Topical Meetings.  These meetings will discuss technological solutions to medical challenges and medical applications and will cover a diversity of cutting-edge research and innovative new tools and techniques that are directly applied to the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cancer. Topics such as ?Preclinical disease research: techniques and applications?; ?Non- invasive optical imaging for disease applications?; ?Tomographic and spectroscopy methods for non-invasive imaging of disease including cancer detection and monitoring?; and ?Focus on pathology & translation? will be explored.  The general purpose of this congress is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events.

"9554068","The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) oversees the scientific aspects of cancer clinical trials conducted at Mayo Clinic through the Center's Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS). Responsibilities of the PRMS are independent and non-overlapping with those of the Mayo IRB and those with responsibilities specific to Data and Safety Monitoring activities. The focus of the PRMS is on scientific merit, priorities, and progress of the clinical research protocols conducted at the MCCC. Due to the volume of studies and significant differences in study population, scientific review is accomplished through one of the Center's two scientific review committees, the Scientific Review Committee (SRC) A and B. The SRC-A reviews all interventional hematologic malignancy studies; the SRC-B reviews all other interventional studies. To ensure consistency across committees, each committee adheres to the same policies and procedures and has ultimate responsibility for the approval/disapproval of each study as well as the final decision concerning prioritization. Dr. Henry Pitot provides overall leadership and expertise to the PRMS. The SRC committees are chaired by Drs. Thomas Witzig (SRC-A: interventional hematologic malignancy studies) and Timothy Hobday (SRC-B: all other interventional studies). The scientific review committees have the authority to approve/defer/disapprove protocols and subsequent amendments and modifications that meet the scientific merit and scientific priorities of the MCCC. In addition, these committees have the authority to close any protocol due to insufficient or poor accrual."
"9652668","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Military personnel deployed to the wars in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom; OEF) and Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom; OIF) are at high risk of sustaining a traumatic brain injury (TBI) from exposures to a blast (i.e., blast waves from explosions) and other types of head injuries (12,52). While early interventions are important to blunt secondary injury and maximize functional outcome, chronic interventions are also needed by veterans to aid recovery of persistent debilitating symptoms resulting from TBI. While motor functions tend to improve significantly, residual cognitive disturbance remains the most significant concern of persons with all severities of TBI. Normal brain cognitive function depends on synaptic communication via neurotransmitter release. We have previously shown that experimental TBI can produce persistent deficits in evoked neurotransmitter release, but the mechanisms are unknown. Neurotransmitter release at the synapse requires fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. A crucial step in this process involves the assembly of a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, a highly stable, parallel four-helix bundle formed between the synaptic vesicle SNARE synaptobrevin 2 (SYB2) and the plasma membrane SNAREs syntaxin 1 and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25). The pathology of SNARE proteins may play an important role in TBI, especially concerning neurotransmission and subsequent cognitive disturbances. Cysteine string protein alpha (CSP?) promotes SNARE-complex assembly by chaperoning SNAP-25 during synaptic activity. It has recently been discovered that lithium, at therapeutically relevant concentrations, can enhance the expression of CSP?. This represents a novel mechanism by which lithium may restore neurotransmitter release deficits after TBI. We have preliminary evidence showing a decrease in both CSP? expression and SNARE-complex assembly after TBI that is attenuated by lithium treatment. It is well known that lithium has multiple actions. We will also contrast the chronic effects of lithium treatment on SNARE proteins to GSK3b and BDNF levels which represent traditional mechanisms of action of lithium. The goal of this proposal is to determine the effects of chronic TBI on key SNARE-complex mechanisms of neurotransmission. The overall hypothesis is that chronic cognitive deficits following TBI may be, at least partially, attributable to impairment in synaptic SNARE-complex formation and subsequent neurotransmitter release deficits. Specific Aim 1 will examine the effects of TBI on individual SNARE proteins, SNARE-complex assembly, and CSP?, a key regulator of SNARE-complex assembly. Specific Aim 2 will determine if increasing the expression of CSP? by lithium is associated with a restoration of SNARE-complex assembly, cognitive function, and histopathology. Specific Aim 3 will determine if lithium, at doses that attenuate SNARE complex loss, can attenuate evoked neurotransmitter release deficits after TBI. Lithium treatment is initiated at chronic intervals that are relevant to Veteran's exposed to TBI-inducing physical forces. Successful completion of this project may provide evidence that SNARE-complexes and cognitive function are chronically diminished after TBI and can be restored, at least partially, by lithium therapy."
"9456719","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental step in understanding sensation is understanding how neural circuits in the brain transform patterns of sensory neuron activity into robust and efficient representations of the external world. Sensation is an active process in which the detection and initial encoding of sensory information is dynamically modulated by sampling behavior and behavioral state. Understanding how central circuits process sensory information in the context of active sampling is critical for understanding the neural basis of sensation in the behaving animal. The goals of this project are to understand how neural circuits in the mammalian olfactory bulb transform sensory inputs in vivo and in the context of active odor sampling. We will ask how certain bulb networks - in particular those mediating interactions between glomerular modules (interglomerular circuits) and those mediating inhibition within a glomerulus (intraglomerular circuits) shape the patterns of olfactory bulb output that are transmitted to cortex as a neural code for odor information. We will also ask how active 'sniffing' of odors at high frequency changes the operation of these circuits. We will use an innovative toolbox of genetic, optical and electrophysiological approaches that we have optimized for the in vivo dissection of circuit function, applied primarily in the awake, head-fixed mouse. There are two broad Aims designed to generate an understanding of the how the olfactory bulb network transforms sensory inputs acquired by the behaving animal. The first Aim focuses on interglomerular circuits and will map how these circuits influence mitral cell output from olfactor bulb glomeruli and how they are organized with respect to the glomerular odor map. We will use optogenetic activation of sensory input to genetically-tagged glomeruli expressing different odorant receptors, combined with selective imaging of excitation and inhibition from mitral cells innervating these glomeruli. The second Aim focuses on intraglomerular inhibition and will ask what role this inhibition plays in shaping the input-output functions of mitral cells during natura odor sampling. We will quantitatively compare responses of periglomerular versus mitral cells to optogenetically- and odorant-evoked inputs using imaging in the awake mouse, and perform whole-cell recordings from mitral cells during selective optogenetic suppression of intra- (but not inter-) glomerular inhibition. The overall impact of this project will be to advance a mechanistic understanding of how central circuits transform sensory inputs into the neural patterns of activity that underlie perception and an understanding of how these circuits function during behavior."
"9667139","1. Project Summary Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In healthy cells, mitochondria consume nutrients and generate most of the energy. However, in cells from inflamed tissue, less energy is produced by mitochondria, and nutrients are reorganized as building blocks to better support cell survival. To date, extensive studies have been focused on the changes and impact of macronutrients such as glucose and lipids in inflamed tissues, but much less is known about the contribution of micronutrients such as iron to IBD. Iron is essential in mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is important for cell survival. Iron is also needed for mitochondria to produce iron-sulfur clusters (ISC) that support many critical cellular processes including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The long-term goal is to understand how iron interacts with mitochondria and contributes to the disease progression of IBD. The candidate hypothesizes that mitochondrial iron is a critical mediator for the IBD development by regulating TCA cycle and ROS production. There have been several hurdles that have made understanding the effects of mitochondrial iron on the intestinal inflammation difficult to study, namely appropriate cell and animal models. Here the candidate proposes to utilize a set of unique models: 1) enteroids that keep an intact iron transport system and inflammatory response; 2) a novel transgenic mouse model with intestinal epithelium-specific overexpression of a ferrireductase six transmembrane epithelial antigen 4 (STEAP4), which has enhanced mitochondrial iron accumulation and increased susceptibility to colitis; 3) a novel and highly clinic-relevant humanized Il10-/- mouse model of chronic colitis. The candidate will focus on the following specific aims: 1) Characterize the effect of iron on mitochondrial metabolism in IBD; 2) Understand the role of STEAP4 in mitochondrial iron homeostasis in IBD; 3) Characterize if mitochondrial iron dysregulation contributes to IBD-associated dysbiosis. Accomplishing these goals will provide a mechanistic explanation and novel targets for prevention or treatment of IBD. Aim 1 in the proposal will build upon the strengths and interests of the mentors? laboratories with respect to iron metabolism in the intestine. Moreover, accomplishing Aim 1 will allow the adequate training to utilize the novel enteroids to study the impact of mitochondrial iron on TCA cycles and the utilization of iron. This will aid the transition of the candidate?s research career toward an independent investigator position. Accomplishing Aims 2 and 3 will allow the candidate to understand the role of the ferrireductase STEAP4 in intestinal epithelial biology and the interaction of host mitochondrial micronutrients with the gut microbiota. Together, this proposal is not only critical for the candidate?s career development in the field of micronutrient metabolism and gut microbiota research, but also it will aid in understanding the pathogenesis of IBD."
"9540975","Project Abstract Excessive fat accumulation in the liver can lead to liver failure and is a growing health concern. Hepatic steatosis, the first stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), has been reported in one out of every three adults in the United States. Despite the clinical relevance of NAFLD, questions regarding its molecular pathogenesis remain unanswered. A genome wide study for genes linked to NAFLD demonstrated that the I148M variant of PNPLA3 is robustly associated with hepatic triglyceride (TG) content. However, the role of PNPLA3 in the liver and the mechanism for how the I148M variant promotes liver fat accumulation remain elusive. We have found PNPLA3 interacts with ??? hydrolase domain-containing 5 (ABHD5), the activator of the main TG lipase found in the liver, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL; officially PNPLA2). This interaction is dynamic and regulated by nutritional status. Furthermore, the I148M variant increases PNPLA3 affinity for ABHD5. Our central hypothesis is that PNPLA3 interaction with ABHD5 suppresses lipolysis by preventing the interaction of ABHD5 with ATGL/PNPLA2. In addition, we propose that the I148M variant significantly increases affinity with ABHD5, leading to greater suppression of lipolysis and greater liver fat accumulation. This proposal will examine the how PNPLA3 and the I148M variant affect the subcellular trafficking of ABHD5 and ATGL. We will also determine the functional consequences of the interaction of PNPLA3 and the I148M variant with ABHD5 in hepatocytes. The results of this proposal will lead to a better understanding of how ABHD5 and PNPLA3 regulate lipid metabolism in the liver and how the I148M variant disrupts this regulation leading to increased fat accumulation. Completion of this study will provide the trainee with experience and tools needed to pursue a career as a physician-scientist."
"9469293","ABSTRACT  The identification of a maturational spurt during normal skeletal development is of critical biomedical and public health importance because it will: (1) improve clinical treatment timing for children suffering from skeletal disorders, and (2) provide a more detailed understanding of human skeletal biology for the future biomedical field. Fluctuations in the tempo of skeletal maturation may provide greater prognostic value than other ontogenetic parameters. These fluctuations, including a potential maturational ?spurt,? similar to the pubertal growth spurt, have yet to be comprehensively characterized. Aim 1 of the proposed F31 will use existing data on skeletal age collected by the Sponsor to examine tempo changes in skeletal maturation and to elucidate the relationship between ontogenetic parameters of the maturational spurt with known parameters of the pubertal growth spurt. Aim 2 will provide refined skeletal maturity indicator grades predictive of distinct parameters of the pubertal growth spurt and the maturational spurt. This aim will include the collection of new skeletal maturity indicator data by the applicant. Because the timing of skeletal maturity is influenced by racial and/or ethnic background, Aim 3 will focus on characterizing the tempo of maturation in children of African American, Asian American, and Hispanic descent. These Aims will be accomplished by leveraging existing longitudinal data from two longitudinal studies of childhood and incorporating a variety of multi-level, repeated-measure modeling techniques, including polynomial modeling and ordinal logistic regression. The results from the proposed analyses will provide clinicians with improved skeletal maturity assessment tools that will lead to optimization of individualized pediatric treatment timing and improved quality of life in patients with skeletal disorders."
"9414449","Abstract Among the 6 racial and ethnic categories recognized by the US Census Bureau, 3 stand out for their similarity in history, demographics, visibility, and health: American Indians (AIs), Alaska Natives (ANs), and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs). NHPIs and AI and ANs (the latter 2 are typically combined) are the smallest and second-smallest US racial groups, with populations of 1.2 and 5.2 million, respectively. These groups experience harsh disparities in health and mortality compared to US Whites. Concerning are their population prevalences of hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and stroke, which are as high as, and usually higher than, US Whites. Despite these serious public health inequities, both groups have been largely neglected by health research. A literature search for interventions targeting blood pressure (BP) control as a contributor to CVD and stroke in AIs, ANs, and NHPIs returned no results. No interventions ? and thus no multilevel intervention studies ? have ever focused on BP control in these groups. Accordingly, the overarching objective of Native-Controlling Hypertension And Risks through Technology (Native-CHART) is to improve control of BP and associated CVD and stroke risk factors among these populations. Our research agenda articulates a practical model of health and health disparities grounded in lived experience as well as in theory. Our community-based participatory approach increases the likelihood that findings will confer sustainable benefits within AI, AN, and NHPI communities, which range from large urban areas to frontier villages in Alaska. Our approach harnesses technologies available in the settings where participants live, work, and obtain healthcare ? including electronic health records, text messaging, online grocery shopping apps, wearable physical activity monitors, and home BP monitors. Our 3 Research Projects feature interventions at the individual, family, community, and policy levels. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) expand and establish new collaborations with research partners across private, tribal, and public constituencies that address BP control within a multilevel intervention framework; 2) develop a multilevel, multisector infrastructure that ensures inclusion of local, regional, and national views on research priorities and approaches to controlling BP; 3) promote a scientifically rigorous, culturally informed program of inquiry that acquires new knowledge to implement innovative approaches to increase hypertension knowledge and awareness, activate patients, increase medication adherence, and improve BP control among AIs, ANs, and NHPIs. Our goal is to move research on BP control and CVD and stroke risk factors in these communities beyond its current, largely descriptive state, and translate that knowledge into meaningful action."

"9648032","DESCRIPTION:         Temporal coding is the ability of the auditory system to detect and transmit fluctuations in time across the acoustic signal. Sensorineural hearing loss and early aging have the potential to reduce the temporal resolving power of the auditory system. The relevant literature, however, shows mixed results from psychophysical studies, speech perception studies, and physiologic studies. The lack of a clear understanding of how hearing loss changes temporal processing (or not) may be the result of several factors including early age-related changes in neural recovery or adaptation and methodological issues (e.g., equivalent presentation levels, stimulus complexity). A series of experiments to measure temporal processing in middle-aged adults with and without high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (abbreviated as HFL throughout proposal) is proposed. This understudied group has been largely overlooked in the study of auditory aging because most older subjects have some degree of high-frequency hearing loss and research is often conducted in low-frequency regions where pure-tone thresholds are similar to those of younger subjects. Presenescent changes have been found for speech perception (Helfer and Fargo, 2009) and for auditory temporal coding (Grose et al., 2006). Significantly poorer gap detection occurs for stimuli presented in regions of normal pure-tone sensitivity when high-frequency hearing loss is present. The proposed research will improve our understanding of early aging and HFL on auditory temporal coding. The purpose of the primary study is to determine the extent to which early aging and HFL impact temporal coding in regions of normal low-frequency hearing. The current study addresses these purposes with the following three specific questions: (1) Is there a significant difference in low-frequency temporal coding between listeners with normal pure-tone sensitivity and listeners with HFL? (2) Is there a significant difference in temporal coding between young subjects (aged 18 - 30 years) and middle-aged subjects (aged 40 - 60 years) who have normal pure-tone sensitivity? and (3) Are psychophysical or electrophysiologic measures of temporal coding related? Four groups of subjects will be targeted for a series of experiments as follows: (1) young adults with normal pure-tone sensitivity (YNH), (2) middle-aged adults with normal pure-tone sensitivity (MANH), (3) young adults with HFL (YHFL), and (4) middle-aged adults with HFL (MAHFL). Normal hearing will be defined as pure-tone thresholds d25 dB HL for the frequencies from 250- to 8000 Hz. High-frequency hearing will be defined as pure-tone thresholds d25 dB HL from 250 - 2000 Hz and e 35 dB HL from 3000 - 8000 Hz. Participants will be recruited from the Audiology Clinic at the VA at Mountain Home. One short-term objective is to acquire a high-level of technical understanding of signal processing and experimental design as well as insight into parallel experimental designs in multiple domains (e.g., clinical audiology, psychophysics, and electrophysiology). The new skills will provide a bridge between my basic research skills acquired to date and advanced skills necessary to transition into an independent VA investigator. A second short-term goal is to acquire the experience needed to analyze cortical auditory evoked potentials, which inherently are complex. Thus, the focus will be practical and theoretical integration by leveraging the expertise of the CDA-2 mentors (Drs. Murnane, Eddins, and Fowler)."
"9673644","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza viruses are constantly changing, requiring the reformulation of vaccines every year. Accurately estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza infection is critical in order to evaluate the protection provided by annua, nationwide vaccination programs. Our long-term goal is to discover more advanced strategies to measure vaccine effectiveness, to potentially reduce the overall burden of influenza infection. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines with the ACIP recommended universal immunization strategy in the Scott and White Memorial Hospital -Temple Population Research Area (SWH-TPRA) adult source population will be systematically investigated. The objective of the proposed work is to explore strategies for measuring vaccine effectiveness against lab-confirmed influenza (VE-LCI) in adult inpatients, including the elderly, who have the highest hospitalization rates. This includes the identification, implementation and evaluation of innovative, feasible, and sustainable strategies for measuring VE-LCI in persons aged 18 years or older in acute inpatient care settings. The central hypothesis is that timely and efficient measurement of VE- LCI in adult inpatients is feasible and sustainable in the U.S. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify innovative, feasible, and sustainable strategies to measure VE-LCI in a timely and efficient manner for persons ? 18 years admitted with an acute respiratory illness (ARI) in acute inpatient care settings, 2) Implement the above strategies to measure VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI, and 3) Evaluate the above strategies to measure VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI. To achieve these goals, VE-LCI will be determined in adults admitted to SWMH with ARI who test positive for influenza A and/or B by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The odds of being vaccinated against influenza for PCR-confirmed cases will be compared to age-matched PCR-negative controls, after adjusting for confounders. During 2015- 2016 through 2019-2020, 300 patients and 800 adults admitted to SWMH with an ARI will be eligible to participate in the BSWH CDC VE-LCI adult inpatient study, respectively. Using a test-negative study design, VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI will be measured. Influenza immunization rates will be calculated for the RT-PCR confirmed cases and test negative controls, adjusting VE-LCI for confounders. The approach is innovative because effective measures of the public health impact of increasing influenza immunization on burden of illness will be defined. The proposed research is significant, because it will support improved understanding of timely and efficient measures of VE-LCI, which in turn will support the goal of reducing influenza-associated health burdens."
"9657869","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motility enables sperm to reach the egg for fertilization, and normal sperm motility is largely dependent on formation and function of the flagella. An elongating spermatid-specific, the manchette, has been proposed to play a central role in sperm flagella formation. Meiosis expressed protein 1 (MEIG1) is a key protein that regulates manchette stability and sperm flagella formation. The protein was identified as a binding partner of Sperm Associated-Antigen 16L (SPAG16L), a sperm tail axoneme protein; it also binds the protein product (PACRG) of the Parkin co-regulated gene. The reproductive phenotype of Pacrg-deficient mice mirrors that of the Meig1 mutant mice. PACRG is expressed post-meiotically and is localized to the manchette. MEIG1 and SPAG16L are present in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes. However, both proteins migrate to the manchette in elongating spermatids. MEIG1 loses its manchette localization in the Pacrg-deficient elongating spermatids. In Meig1-deficient mice, SPAG16L loses its manchette localization. These observations suggest a role for MEIG1 in protein escort/targeting. MEIG1 consists of only 88 amino acids, and no functional domains were identified with bioinformatic tools. It is phosphorylated in vivo, and phosphorylation might modulate MEIG1 function, although this has not been established. Our preliminary studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed that MEIG1 forms an unique structure that provides a large surface area for interaction with other proteins, and several amino acids, including several potential sites for phosphorylation in the aromatic and charged regions, may form protein-protein interaction surfaces. The long-term objective of this research is to investigate the role of MEIG1 complexes in mammalian sperm flagellogenesis. We propose three aims: 1) To dissect the SPAG16L/MEIG1/PACRG complex in vivo and in vitro; 2) To identify domains of MEIG1 that mediate interactions with PACRG and SPAG16L; 3). To determine the role of post-translational modification in MEIG1 function. We hypothesize that MEIG1 functions as a chaperone that associates with multiple proteins, maintains the integrity of the manchette, and plays a role in assembly of the sperm flagella. PACRG recruits MEIG1 to the manchette through binding to a specific domain of MEIG1, and MEIG1 binds other proteins such as SPAG16L through a different domain. Mutations/deletions of the domains will reduce or abolish MEIG1 interaction with these proteins. MEIG1 binds to PACRG and SPAG16L with differential binding affinities to facilitate docking of MEIG1 to PACRG associated with the manchette and off-loading of its cargo (e.g., SPAG16L). We anticipate that MEIG1 has several phosphorylated amino acids in vivo, and phosphorylation controls its affinity to cargo proteins. Little is known about the mechanisms that lead to the proper targeting and assembly of these molecules into the sperm flagellum. The research proposed in this application will, for the first time, reveal the molecular basis of the escort of proteins to the site of flagellum assembly, and the structure/function relationships of a unique chaperone that is essential for normal spermiogenesis."
"9674693","Opportunity #PA-13-244 University of Pennsylvania - Method Validation and Comparison for the  Detection of Mycotoxins in Novel Animal Feeds and Tissues    PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    The PADLS New Bolton Center Toxicology Laboratory proposes to investigate the ability to adapt and  validate the use of the Charm ROSA-M reader for the analysis of priority mycotoxins (aflatoxins, DON,  zearalenone, T-2/HT-2, fumonisins, and ochratoxin) in complex animal feeds and pet foods and compare  its use to other readily-available methods. If the Charm ROSA-M readers can be validated for the  analysis of dog food, cattle feed, and swine feed, they will provide an easy method for minimally-trained  personnel at multiple laboratories to quickly screen large volumes of samples in the event of a  suspected animal feed contamination incident. Validation and comparison of methods for the analysis of  additional mycotoxins of interest in animal feeds and pet foods (15-AcDON, penitrem A, roquefortine C,  and moniliformin) will also be performed.  Due to recent historical contamination events involving aflatoxins in dog food and the frequent number  of investigations involving pet foods in general, we propose working with this matrix type first. Our  second matrix type will be cattle feed due to the animal and human health risks that could occur due to  mycotoxin contamination meant for either beef or dairy cattle, particularly the mycotoxins that can pass  into milk. Based on the wide use of corn-based feeds for swine and because this species is often among  those most sensitive to mycotoxins, we have selected swine feed as our third feed matrix.   During the final phases of the project, methods for the analysis of selected mycotoxins will be developed  and validated in tissues and biological fluids samples from dogs, cattle, and swine to best facilitate  complete investigations of contaminated animal feed events, particularly for these species.  After completing the validation for each analyte and matrix in our laboratory, samples will be sent out  for validation to 7 other collaborating Vet-LIRN laboratories. The final products for this project will be a  standardized method SOP for the analysis of priority mycotoxins in feeds using the Charm ROSA-M  reader and harmonized method SOPs for the analysis of additional mycotoxins in feeds and selected  mycotoxins in animal samples using LC/MS/MS.  1"

"9422715","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My ultimate goal to establish an independent research agenda that develops novel statistical methods for population research in developing nations and other data-constrained environments. I focus specifically on developing estimates for vital indicators, which are especially critical to understanding population dynamics, developing public programs, and implementing or evaluating public health actions. In most parts of the developing world, there is massive uncertainty about even the most basic indicators. Achieving this objective requires an interdisciplinary skill-set that has three components: (i) expertise in statistical modeling, (ii) an understanding the historical, social/cultural and economc underpinnings of core themes in demography and (iii) experience with the complex realities of collecting demographic data in developing countries. After doctoral work in statistics, I am prepared for the first of these three components. My training and development plan proposes a series of activities to address the second two components. My mentoring team consists of Stewart Tolnay (mentor), Sam Clark (co- mentor), Adrian Raftery (advisory committee) and Basia Zaba (advisory committee). First, I will pursue training to understand, and eventually contribute to, substantive questions in demography and ecology. I will work to understand how various social, cultural, and economic factors relate to individuals' demographic outcomes and how these outcomes relate to population dynamics. Though social science questions motivate my study of statistics, I have no formal training in demography and my only formal training in the social sciences is at an undergraduate level. I address this gap in my current training through coursework and directed readings with a highly skilled and experience mentoring team.  Second, my statistical training leaves me unprepared to address the complex realities of data collection in developing nations. My statistical training emphasizes analysis tools for data already collected, often under restrictive assumptions. Data used for demographic research in developing nations, however, often violates these assumptions and nonsampling error is rampant. I address this gap through coursework as well as fieldwork experiences. I propose two substantial (consisting of approximately 6-8 weeks each) fieldwork experiences at the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System in the northeast of South Africa. The Agincourt site, which features prominently in both my development and training plans, includes annual census and special events updates (systematic recording of all births, deaths and migrations), making Agincourt one of the very few places with both high-quality validation data and infrastructure to implement and evaluate new data collection methodologies. During my visits I will, under the supervision of my mentoring team, observe interviews, meet key survey research personnel, and discuss the findings and ideas of my research proposal with Agincourt investigators.  My experiences in Agincourt are a tangible link between the research and training components of my proposal. The research proposal focuses on estimating fertility in such situations and understanding the key drivers of changes in national and regional fertility patterns. Fertility is an important determinant of population size and composition. Quality information about fertility is key for formulating national and regional policy, developing public programs, and implementing and evaluating public health actions. I propose a technique for estimating fertility in developing countries that emphasizes the relationship between data collection, model, and outcome. An overarching Bayesian modeling framework incorporates nonsampling error, draws strength from similar respondents, and naturally shares uncertainty between different data sources. The proposed methods would reduce bias by adjusting for variability introduced through nonsampling errors, provide statistically principled measures of uncertainty for national and subnational estimates and generate recommendations for efficient survey design. Using the same modeling framework, I will also evaluate specific hypotheses about observed and projected trends in fertility.  Aim 1 develops a model to estimate national and subnational fertility rates in developing nations and evaluates that model using both DHS and Agincourt data. Aim 2 proposes a microsimulation environment that facilitates testing hypotheses about fertility patterns and dynamics at an individual or household level. This environment also facilitates testing hypotheses about measurement error, which will again be evaluated extensively using Agincourt and DHS data. Aim 3 develops models to project future fertility rates that incorporate uncertainty in the underlying individual-level covariates that are associated with changes in national and regional rates. I will also make projections using both past Agincourt data (a census has been in place for approximately 20 years) and make actual predictions of future fertility rates in Agincourt that I will evaluate at the end of the project priod."
"9617518","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this proposed research project is to establish a dynamic spatio-temporal source imaging methodology that is able to image and localize epileptogenic brain from noninvasive high resolution electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements to aid surgical planning in epilepsy patients. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting 50 million people worldwide. In approximately 30% of these patients the seizures are not controlled by any available drug therapy, and surgery is a viable option for partial epilepsy. Localization and imaging of epileptogenic brain responsible for seizures is of paramount importance for successful epilepsy surgery. Currently, definite localization of epileptogenic zone is performed from invasive intracranial EEG. In the proposed research project, we propose to develop novel noninvasive source imaging methods that promise to localize and image source extent corresponding to epileptogenic zone, from interictal spikes and high frequency oscillation activities that can be measured using high density electrode array. We also propose to validate rigorously the proposed source imaging techniques in a group of epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial EEG recordings and surgical resection. The specific aims are: Aim 1) Development of EEG source extent imaging methods for imaging epileptogenic brain. Aim 2) Development of high-frequency source imaging methods for imaging epileptogenic brain. Aim 3) Validation of source imaging methods from intracranial recordings and surgical resections in partial epilepsy patients. The successful completion of the proposed research promises to lead to establishment of a disruptive technology to localizing and imaging of epileptogenic brain from noninvasive high resolution EEG, which can significantly advance state-of-the-art of management of intractable epilepsy. The development of such novel technology would benefit numerous patients suffering from partial epilepsy and the healthcare system."
"9469598","Project Summary The proposal describes a research strategy and training plan to develop the principal investigator, Mr. Joseph Fischer, throughout his graduate career. Mr. Fischer is currently a graduate student in the Human Genetics Graduate Program at Johns Hopkins University. His long-term goal is to become a principal investigator at a predominately teaching institution, working with circular RNA. In order to accomplish this goal, Mr. Fischer must be successfully trained and develop experience in molecular biology, cellular biology, presentation skills and teaching. Mr. Fischer has assembled a diverse mentorship and collaborative team with expertise in all aspects of molecular and cellular biology in order to achieve his goals. His training and career development plan include formal coursework as well as seminars, lab meetings, and teaching opportunities. The proposed research and training plan will guide Mr. Fischer to a successful career as a graduate student and future endeavors. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of non-coding RNAs that is abundantly and dynamically expressed in a diverse range of eukaryotes that has been recently re-discovered with the advancement of RNA-sequencing technologies. Currently, the functional significance of most circRNAs is unknown, however, specific circRNAs have been found to perform various functions such as regulate microRNA activity, sequester protein localization, and act as a scaffold or inhibitor to regulate protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions. While the majority of the past research has been focused on identifying their presence and specific functions, the regulation of their stability remains poorly understood. These circRNAs are highly stable and their enhanced stability may provide additional insights into RNA regulation within cells. The goal of this study is to identify factors and sequence specific features that regulate their stability. Overall, the proposed study will allow us to identify the first known regulator of circRNA stability. Additionally my work has the potential to be applicable to other classes of RNA, and it could help further explain the complex expression and dynamic profiles of RNA."
"9398129","Abstract Few interventions have been shown to be as beneficial to human health as physical exercise, yet we remain largely ignorant of the mechanisms by which those potent effects are transduced. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium will examine the response to acute and chronic exercise at multiple scales and in multiple tissues across thousands of humans and in animal models. The study will combine state of the art phenotyping with molecular omics approaches. Building on our long history of analytical innovation in high throughput biology and experience in the analysis of perhaps the largest multi- omic study funded to date, the Stanford MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center will provide core compute, storage and analytic expertise to the MoTrPAC investigators. Taking advantage of our close links with the Stanford high performance computing center and the Google cloud engineering team, we will build a platform for the secure sharing of time-series, training-related, multi-omic, physiological and sensor based measurement data. Aim 1 is focused on creating a local test computing environment and a cloud-based data warehouse for raw data. We will achieve this by first establishing standards for data security and privacy, protocols for data sharing, and a common data element dictionary. Aim 2 describes both the extension of existing omics pipelines and the development of new pipelines for raw multi-omic data. In addition, we propose the development of novel analytic approaches for multi-scale, high-throughput data. Building on expertise from Stanford's renowned statistics department as well as the new department of Biomedical Data Science, we will extend graph based approaches developed by our team into the time dimension across multiple data sets to understand the systems biology of the response to physical training at a fundamental level. In addition, we will focus on data integration and novel visualization approaches. Aim 3 is concerned with building an interactive interface for investigators and participants to interrogate, interact with, explore, and securely download the data. Aim 4 will look outside of MoTrPAC to broader integration with relevant datasets such as GTeX, GEO, the Precision Medicine Cohort, the UK Biobank and others. We believe our team's direct experience in the leadership of studies such as the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, ENCODE, ClinGen, BD2K (Mobilize Center), and MyHeart Counts (one of the launch applications for Apple's ResearchKit framework) will be advantageous in maximizing the benefit of MoTrPAC for investigators around the world."
"9453568","Project Summary Maternally acquired microbes may predispose to disease later in life; however, the determinants of niche establishment and their contributions to disease are poorly understood. We have developed a mouse model of vertical transmission in which the common human commensal enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), carried by the dam, is stably established in the neonatal microbiota. Surprisingly, Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT), a carbohydrate-regulated metalloprotease associated with E-cadherin cleavage, is a key determinant of maternal inheritance, as BFT-deficient ETBF shows impaired persistence in weaned mice. Enteric disease in adulthood can be induced by antibiotics and is characterized by ETBF outgrowth, elevated bft expression, and loss of colonic mucus. We propose a model in which antibiotic treatment favors expansion of the mucolytic ETBF population and depletion of mucus-associated sugars, leading to bft derepression and host injury."
"9637803","Project Summary/Abstract  Impaired fertility due to compromised ovarian function affects millions of American women today. The ovarian follicle (each contains one oocyte) is the fundamental functional tissue unit of the ovary. Therefore, isolation and cryopreservation of ovarian follicles for in vitro culture to obtain healthy fertilizable oocytes have been regarded as a promising strategy for restoring and preserving female fertility.  However, none of the methods used today for follicle culture recapitulate the mechanical heterogeneity experienced by both the primary and pre-antral follicles in the ovary. Using a non-planar microfluidic device, we have recently fabricated a biomimetic ovarian microtissue that consists of a more rigid alginate hydrogel shell and a softer collagen core to mimic the harder ovarian cortex and softer ovarian medulla, respectively. The follicle is partially embedded both in the core and shell, which recapitulates the mechanical heterogeneity experienced by the follicles in vivo. With this biomimetic ovarian microtissue, we revealed that the mechanical heterogeneity is crucial for developing early pre-antral follicles to the antral stage and ovulation to release oocytes. We hypothesize that the biomimetic ovarian microtissue system can be further developed for in vitro culture of both primary and early pre-antral follicles.  For follicle cryopreservation, contemporary approaches require either a highly toxic concentration (up to ~8 M) of membrane-penetrating cryoprotectants (CPAs) to vitrify (i.e., cooling to cryogenic temperature without ice formation) the follicles, or slowly freezing the follicles to form extracellular ice and dehydrate them. The latter is associated with inevitable physicochemical damage to cells due to ice formation. Our recent studies revealed that alginate hydrogel microencapsulation is exceptional in suppressing ice formation and growth, which allows vitrification of a variety of stem cells at a low CPA concentration (1.5-2 M) with high viability and intact function post cryopreservation. This low-CPA vitrification approach combines all the advantages of the conventional approaches for cell cryopreservation while avoiding their shortcomings. We hypothesize that this low-CPA vitrification approach can be used to cryopreserve the primary and early pre-antral follicles encapsulated in the biomimetic microtissue, due to the presence of an alginate hydrogel shell in the microtissue.  The objective of this project is to test the aforementioned two hypotheses with three specific aims: 1), to develop a computational model for understanding the complex multi-phase flow occurred during microfluidic encapsulation of follicles in the biomimetic ovarian microtissue; 2), to microencapsulate both primary and early pre-antral follicles for biomimetic 3D culture in vitro; and 3), to cryopreserve primary and early pre-antral follicles encapsulated in the biomimetic ovarian microtissue by low-CPA vitrification. The novel non-planar microfluidic device, biomimetic ovarian microtissue system, and low-CPA vitrification technology are valuable for studying follicle biology, screening pharmaceutical drugs, and restoring/preserving the fertility of women."

"9623980","Contact PD/PI: Dere, Willard H. NRSA-Training-001 (001) ABSTRACT ? TRAINING CORE (TL1) This TL1 training program proposes to train 3 new predoctoral students and 2 new postdoctoral trainees every year with 25 trainees across 5 years. Each trainee will receive funding for two years. The TL1 program will provide the necessary predoctoral and postdoctoral training to produce scientists with a deep appreciation of the spectrum of translational science, a team science outlook and an aptitude for cross-discipline communication. The conceptual framework that guides the training program organizes the translational continuum into three Spheres of Translation Across the Research Spectrum (?STARS?): Discovery, Demonstration and Dissemination. Trainees undertake research within one of these spheres, and will also receive training across the spectrum, to emerge with an invaluable broad perspective of how their own research fits within the breadth of translational science and how discoveries move through the continuum. Training will include translational science, team science, entrepreneurship, community engagement, immersion opportunities (e.g., clinical observation, wet and dry lab experiences, externships, entrepreneurial experiences), ethics, grant and manuscript writing, communication, management and leadership development. Additionally, trainees will receive holistic mentoring and career guidance. We will create a cadre of scholars with a commanding knowledge and experiences across all three translational spheres, and a deep commitment to transdisciplinary team science. We are equally committed to ensuring a diverse group of scholars in order to ensure the pipeline of scientists are as diverse as the subjects they research. Finally, we believe strongly that it is important to train mentors, especially new mentors, on how to be effective mentors and advocates for trainees. Thus, another innovative component of this training program is the inclusion and training of ?emerging mentors?. These mentors are junior faculty with a history of external funding and significant publications and who are interested in learning how to be effective mentors. They will receive mentoring and leadership training and will co-mentor trainees with an experienced and senior mentor. Trainees will also receive significant benefit from receiving mentoring advice from a ?near peer?, particularly in terms of career development. Our overarching goal is to produce a next generation of scientists with strategic translational emphases who are successful communicators across disciplines and whose breadth of knowledge across the STARS can increase transdisciplinary cross fertilization and accelerate healthcare advances.

INTERMOUNTAIN WEST REGION The Intermountain West The University of Utah (U of Utah) healthcare system (U Health) is the only academic health center in the Intermountain West region. The Intermountain West, comprised of Utah and Nevada, as well as parts of Wyoming, New Mexico, Idaho, Arizona, and Colorado, collectively encompasses more than 10% of the continental United States. Importantly, the Intermountain West contains not only urban and suburban, but also large rural and immense frontier areas. The population of the region, over 22 million in the 2010 census, is steadily growing (Figure 1). Utah According to the US Census Bureau, the State of Utah is the fastest growing state in the U.S. with a current population estimate of 3 million residents. This growth is attributed to a higher than the national average birth rate but also net in-migration from other states and countries. This population is unique, with lower median age (30.7% under 18, average age 29.2), larger families (3.12 persons per household compared to 2.63) Importantly, many of Utah's families are multigenerational, and have a long history in the state and surrounding region. Utah is a racially and ethnically diverse state. Utah's minority share is 21% and is comparable to national averages, with large Hispanic/Latino communities, and significant Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Asian, Black/African American, and multiethnic communities. Utah is home to seven Native American tribes/nations: Shoshone, Goshute, Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation, Paiute, Navajo (Dine), White Mesa, and Ute. Of note, among Pacific Islander communities, approximately one of four people of Tongan descent living in the United States live in Utah. Over 40 languages other than English are Figure 1.

"9394059","Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: The first three essential strategies listed within the VA's Blueprint for Excellence encompass plans to improve care to vulnerable Veterans, deliver high quality care through achieving the ?Triple Aim? and leverage the use of technology to improve the efficiency of care delivery. The intervention this grant proposes focuses on improving medication safety and care coordination within a high risk vulnerable Veteran population, leverages the use of informatics and analytics to support this intervention, and aims to demonstrate improved care at reduced costs through the pharmacist intervention; thus, perfectly aligning with these three essential components of the Blueprint. The overarching goal of this study is to develop a feasibly deployable, technology-enabled intervention that will demonstrate substantial improvements in immunosuppressant medication safety, clinical outcomes and health care costs in Veteran organ transplant recipients; demonstrating this through a randomized controlled trial will provide sufficient evidence to further develop a VA-specific pharmacist learning collaborative aimed at improving care and reducing costs for Veteran organ transplant recipients across the entire VA system. Background: Organ transplant is the gold-standard treatment for patients with end organ diseases of the kidney, liver, heart and lungs, as it substantially improves survival and quality of life. Over the past 20 years, the use of contemporary immunosuppression has reduced the risk of acute rejection rates by upwards of 80%; yet long-term allograft survival remains suboptimal. Studies have demonstrated that causes of late graft loss is predominantly driven by immunosuppression adverse events and late allograft rejection episodes from medication errors and non-adherence, which encompass issues directly related to medication safety. Our research demonstrates that medication errors occur in nearly two-thirds of transplant recipients, leading to hospitalization in 1 in 8 recipients. Recipients that develop significant medication errors are at considerably higher risk of graft loss, leading to higher costs and mortality. Thus, in order to improve medication safety and long-term outcomes in transplant recipients, enhancements in immunosuppressant therapy management is needed. Objectives: The central hypothesis for the ISTEP study (Improving Transplant Medication Safety through a TEchnology and Pharmacist Intervention) is that pharmacist-led immunosuppressant therapy management, facilitated through the use of innovative technology, will significantly improve immunosuppressant safety and clinical outcomes in Veteran transplant recipients. Methods: This is a 24-month, prospective, multicenter, cluster-randomized controlled clinical trial at 10 sites, randomizing 5 sites to standard clinical care and 5 to standard care and the technology-enabled pharmacist intervention. The technology component of this intervention consists of the use of an expanded dashboard system that has already demonstrated effectiveness in improving immunosuppression monitoring. The dashboard performs population-level surveillance of transplant recipients and identifies those with potential drug-related problems, including non-adherence, drug interactions, missing and worrisome trends in labs; then providing a real-time alert to the pharmacist, who will determine its relevance and intervene in an appropriate protocol-guided manner. Effectiveness will be determined by comparing the rates of hospitalizations and ER visits between groups, while adjusting for baseline patient, provider and facility characteristics. Secondary measures include comparing healthcare costs and determining dashboard functionality, dashboard actionability and pharmacist intervention types and acceptance rates. We will also assess the overall incidence and severity of drug-related problems and graft and patient survival rates and compare these between the intervention and control sites."

"9604912","PROJECT SUMMARY  Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and Hsp70 are molecular chaperones that facilitate protein folding, maturation and clearance. It is well recognized that targeting Hsp90 and Hsp70 with small molecule drugs may improve proteostatic neurodegenerative diseases by enhancing the clearance of neurotoxic protein aggregates. However, we have identified that pharmacologically targeting molecular chaperones has therapeutic value in treating peripheral neuropathies whose etiology is independent of proteostasis. The traditional small molecule approach for targeting Hsp90 has relied on drugs that inhibit its N-terminal ATPase activity. Lamentably, the translational success of these drugs has been hindered by the complex chemical biology of targeting the Hsp90 N-terminal ATP binding site. In contrast, we have developed ?novologues? as small molecule inhibitors of the Hsp90 C-terminal domain that circumvent limitations that have confounded the clinical prospects of Hsp90 as a therapeutic target. Novologues are orally bioavailable and non-toxic molecules that promote a cytoprotective response that constitutes a paradigm shift for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and potentially, demyelinating neuropathies (DymN). Our published and unpublished data support that novologues improve physiologic measures of DPN and DymN in an Hsp70- dependent manner by improving mitochondrial bioenergetics in DPN and inhibiting the induction of c-jun, a negative regulator of myelination, that contributes to DymN. Thus, our central hypothesis is that modulating the activity of molecular chaperones with novologues will provide an innovative and novel approach for the treatment of both DPN and some forms of DymN. Our efforts over the four years of NIH funding have led to the licensing of our lead novologue, KU-596, to a pharmaceutical company and its advancement to Phase I studies for treating DPN. To build upon this success, we have identified attributes and detriments of KU- 596. Specific Aim 1 focuses on the rationale design and development of ?noviomimetics? as a new class of molecules that will improve on the chemical biology of novologues by increasing potency, requiring fewer synthetic steps and exhibiting better metabolic stability. Specific Aim 2 will use two cell-based screening assays to examine the ability to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics in diabetic sensory neurons or increase the degradation of the transcription factor, c-jun. Importantly, we provide evidence that these biochemical readouts are prognostic for in vivo efficacy to improve DPN and DymN, respectively. Compounds that advance through the cell-based assay will undergo ADME screening to aid selecting candidates for in vivo testing in a mouse model of DPN and two models that recapitulate a human demyelinating motor neuropathy. The outcome of this work will extend the success of our drug development program and identify noviomimetics as a new class of neuroprotective compounds for treating peripheral neuropathies.

"9626330","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The full impacts of digital mammography and computer-aided diagnostic (CAD/QIA) systems on the performance of diagnostic mammography are yet to be realized. Lesion composition as described by its 3 compositional thicknesses of protein, lipid, and water (3CB) was recently discovered to be a strong descriptor of abnormal breast lesions. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce unnecessary breast biopsies by creating diagnostic imaging models using the strongest CAD/QIA algorithms incorporating advances such as 3CB. Our objective is to quantify lipid-protein-water signatures around CAD/QIA markers to better predict malignant findings. Our central hypothesis is that lesion composition can be combined with existing CAD/QIA methods to improve the specificity of cancer diagnosis and reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. Our specific aims are as follows: to 1) investigate the sensitivity and specificity of localized 3CB to distinguish breast cancer from benign lesions on prospectively acquired diagnostic mammograms of women recommended to undergo biopsy, 2) compare the sensitivity and specificity of 3CB to an established CAD/QIA method and conventional morphological BI-RADS descriptors, 3) develop a predictive diagnostic model to quantify the probability mammographic findings require biopsy versus don't require biopsy based on clinical risk factors, CAD/QIA measures and 3CB measures, and secondary) investigate advantages of 3-dimensional 3CB signatures using dual-energy digital breast tomosynthesis. The working hypotheses for each are as follows: aim 1 - that unique 3CB signatures of lipid, protein, and water exist for breast cancer versus benign lesions and that this information can be used to better identify lesions that require breast biopsy aim 2 - that automated diagnostic CAD/QIA will yield quantitative lesion features that either correlate with or complement (independent) to the compositional signatures, aim 3 - that localized 3CB measures and established CAD/QIA measures are independent methods that assess different predictors of breast cancer and benign lesions and that the combination of measures from the two methods in a single model will increase the sensitivity and specificity from either one alone, secondary aim - that 3D mammography will provide more accurate lesions compositions than 2D imaging. The research's innovation is the combination of the two independent imaging risk markers: 3CB and a powerful CAD/QIA model, and compares it to the clinical standards used by radiologist. The expected outcomes include 1) a novel 3CB and CAD/QIA combined and accessible technology that will yield improved discernibility between cancerous and benign mammographic findings, 2) extensive, and biologically relevant knowledge on how lesion composition correlates with CAD/QIA findings, and 3) an demonstration of an optimized image-based predictive model for malignancy. We expected an important positive impact because more accurately identification of women with and without breast cancer will reduce the harm of unnecessary biopsies."

"9445449","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are medical devices proven to prevent sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias. Their decisions are based solely upon the intra--?cardiac ECG. This is incomplete information since up to 1/3 of patients experience an inappropriate shock within the first 1-3 years of receiving the implant. Receiving a shock is associated with increased mortality as well as emotional trauma. In contrast, physicians determine whether to shock or medically convert a patient out of a rapid rhythm by determining if the arrhythmia is hemodynamically unstable or stable. An unstable arrhythmia is identified by decreased forward stroke volume (SV) and resultant low blood pressure (BP). A stable arrhythmia is identified by a forward SV or resultant BP close to the patient's baseline. It would be ideal to have beat?by-beat SV available to the generator to assist in the determination of hemodynamic stability.    Our group has developed a new technology which can utilize pre-existing ICD and bi-ventricular pacing leads to input current between the RV septum and lateral LV vein, take the returning voltage signal, remove the myocardial component of this signal, and derive LV SV. Although we have validated the technology in acute large animal studies (see preliminary data), we have not validated the approach in chronic large animals which will require (a) demonstrating our technology is successful over months of time in a large animal heart failure model as lead fibrosis occurs, (b) developing an algorithm to incorporate beat-by-beat SV into current ECG detection algorithms, and (c) proving that the platform works in diseased human hearts. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims:    Aim 1 - Purchase and validate a miniaturized, low power implantable version of our admittance circuit.    Aim 2 - Demonstrate that our admittance circuit developed for chronic implantation can successfully classify arrhythmias into those that can reduce SV, and those that do not in a chronic pacing induced canine model of heart failure. This will (a) determine the impact of lead fibrosis to the myocardium on the drift profile of the admittance signal, and (b) demonstrate that admittance SV will fall as echo SV and BP fall during the induction of VT, vfib, SVT and afib. Conversely, in hemodynamically stable arrhythmias defined by echo SV and BP, admittance SV will successfully mirror these same findings. The signals will be recorded for use in SA 3.    Aim 3 - Develop algorithms that can utilize steady state SV information in conjunction with traditional ECG rate, rhythm, and morphology algorithms to increase the accuracy of generator decisions to either deliver therapy to hemodynamically unstable arrhythmias, or withhold therapy from a stable hemodynamic arrhythmia.

"9673988","Abstract: The long-term goal of this competing renewal is to understand how the previously underappreciated regulation of protein synthesis (mRNA translation) in space and time drives neuronal diversity. Neuronal diversity relies on intricate steps of functional gene expression. It has been established that spatio-temporal expression of transcription factors drive neuronal and dendritic differences. While unidentified molecular mechanisms of post- transcriptional control like mRNA translation have strong potential to drive neuronal diversity, they have been thus far understudied. mRNA translation is the final essential step in the functional gene expression. We showed in the previous funding period that regulation of this process is of the key molecular mechanisms in neocortical neuronal development. Our published and preliminary studies, supported by this grant, have led to five important discoveries. First, we described that genes associated with mRNA translation show temporal dynamics in both expression and activity during neurogenesis in developing neocortices. Second, we reported that mRNA translation and the core components of the ribosome in the neocortex ? the ?neocortical ribosome signature?? are developmentally regulated by the intrinsic Elav RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Third, we published that timed ingrowth of thalamocortical axons secrete WNT morphogen and extrinsically define temporally dynamic mRNA translation and the ribosome signature in the developing neocortex. Fourth, that both Elav RBPs and thalamocortical WNT signaling dictate identities of developing neocortical glutamatergic neurons and maturation of oligodendrocytes. Finally, we reported that prenatal deletion of an Elav RBP results in abnormal neocortical dendritogenesis and behavior. However, there are still critical gaps in our knowledge regarding how timed mRNA translation and ribosome signature dictate development of distinct neocortical glutamatergic neurons. In this proposal, we hypothesize that layer-specific ribosome signatures and RBPs dictate timed mRNA translation in distinct subpopulations of developing glutamatergic neurons, thus governing their neurite development. Therefore, we will determine (1) how RBP-defined ribosome signatures dictate mRNA translation specificity and dendrite and axon development within distinct layer specific subpopulations of neocortical glutamatergic neurons; and (2) how WNT-mediated Frizzled signaling dictates RBP-defined assembly of the neocortical layer- specific ribosome signature, mRNA translation and dendrite and axon development in distinct glutamatergic neurons. To do this, we will use an elegant combination of neuroanatomical, cellular, molecular, and genetic approaches. We have produced all of the preliminary data necessary to demonstrate feasibility of the proposed approaches. Findings from this proposal will reveal previously unrecognized molecular mechanisms of post- transcriptional control in the overall specification of neocortical glutamatergic neurons and dendrite development, which can open new avenues for treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders involving these."

"9617914","Project Summary / Abstract The proteasome is the most complex, important, and intricately regulated protease in nature. When substrates dock onto the proteasome they may undergo a variety of fates in addition to being degraded. Ubiquitin may be removed from the substrate before degradation is initiated, pre-empting degradation. Alternatively, preexisting chains on the substrate may be extended to promote degradation. Some substrate-bound chains can also shut down or slow proteasome activity, through manipulating its conformational state. Chain editing factors also regulate the processivity of the proteasome. In addition, substrate recognition can be mediated by any of six distinct proteasome-associated ubiquitin receptors. These systems were originally revealed mainly in yeast, by us and by other groups, but are conserved in eukaryotes and now understood to be relevant to significant diseases, including cancer and ALS. In this proposal we attempt to define the underlying rules of these editing processes as well as the specific sites in the proteasome that are critical for chain binding and editing. There are two distinct pathways by which a key chain-disassembling factor of the proteasome, USP14, is activated, and both are now defined genetically. One pathway provides for control via AKT-dependent signaling pathways, the other for control by the proteasome. Both pathways will be explored here. Remarkably we have found that the machinery for the activation of Ubp6 (the yeast ortholog of USP14) is identical to that for a substrate- and Ubp6-dependent inhibition of the proteasome itself that we previously reported. This linchpin thus provides for reciprocal regulation between Ubp6 and the proteasome. We will try to achieve deeper insights in these unique pathways by combining genetics, biochemistry, structural biology, and proteomics. We will also investigate USP14/Ubp6 substrate specificity, which, according to our recent work, is completely novel, as these enzymes show a dramatic preference for substrates modified by more than one ubiquitin chain. Another powerful regulator of substrate turnover is Hul5 (whose mammalian ortholog is UBE3C), a ligase that we found to be associated with the proteasome. Hul5 is important for stress resistance and is thought to act by extending proteasome-bound ubiquitin chains. We will identify favored substrates of Hul5 and UBE3C by proteomics and use these to address mechanistic models for these enzymes. We will also clarify the physiology of UBE3C and its close paralog UBE3B, which have both been linked to human disease, and attempt to explain their physiology in terms of specific ubiquitination events. Finally, to better understand how the proteasome processes ubiquitin chains we will address ubiquitin chain recognition itself, a very complex process involving to date at least six distinct receptors. Mutations in these receptors can cause ALS and have been implicated in Alzheimer?s disease. We will search for new proteasomal ubiquitin receptors whose existence is implied by our genetic data, and also investigate the relationship between the ?intrinsic ubiquitin receptors,? which are proteasome subunits, and the ?shuttle factors? that deliver ubiquitin to the proteasome."

Yet, American  Indians (AI), Alaska Natives (AN), and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (NHPI) suffer a disproportionate  burden of hypertension, its attendant CVD and stroke risk factors, as well as clinical CVD and stroke, compared  to other US populations. The Native-Controlling Hypertension And Risks through Technology (Native-CHART)  Methodology Core is devoted to optimizing blood pressure intervention research with partners that serve these  populations. Its goals are to make efficient use of study resources, to optimize internal and external study validity,  and to improve inferential ability. Core members will be involved in study design, sample selection,  measurement, data collection, data management, data analysis, and dissemination of findings. We integrate  methods from epidemiology, biostatistics, health economics, health services and policy, and health outcomes  research, augmented with exceptional experience in qualitative methods. Our Specific Aims are to: 1)  collaborate with our community partners and the Consortium Core to develop and implement methods for  collecting data for the baseline and subsequent needs assessments; 2) apply state-of-the-art research designs,  sampling strategies, and analysis techniques to test the impact of novel interventions for the reduction of blood  pressure and its attendant CVD and stroke risk factors among AI, AN, and NHPI people with hypertension. This  includes locating each Intervention Project within a theoretical framework that reflects the interdependent nature  of multilevel interventions; ensuring the reliability and validity of measures, with attention to minimizing  measurement error and best practices for data collection; and applying a flexible and comprehensive data  analysis strategy guided by multilevel models. This strategy encompasses longitudinal data structures including  within-person change, group-randomized trials, and cross-level intervention effects, using random effects  estimation, generalized estimating equations, and others; maximizing efficient use of resources in developing  policies and procedures; manualizing operations; designing questionnaires and data collection; managing data  and statistical analyses; disseminating findings; and integrating qualitative and quantitative methods to  contextualize and enhance the cultural relevance and public health impact of the Projects; and 3) perform  systematic economic evaluations of the hypertension-control programs through cost-benefit and cost-  effectiveness analyses. Our long history of collaboration with the Intervention Project Leaders and Satellite  Center Directors is complemented by the Methodology Core?s understanding of the unique needs and challenges  inherent in conducting research with AIs, ANs, and NHPIs. The Core will be invaluable in ensuring that Native  CHART?s work contributes to better management of hypertension and its attendant risks in these populations."
"9391613","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Project Summary/Abstract We are excited to observe significant differences in the GPR109A levels in the white blood cells (macrophages) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and control individuals. Moreover, we observed similar changes in the GPR109A expressions in the substantia nigra regions that co-localize with the microglia of the PD patients and age-matched controls. We are the first lab to denote these changes. GPR109A is an anti- inflammatory receptor and niacin acts on it. Niacin is an anti-inflammatory agent and it is known to halt inflammation via GPR109A and nuclear factor-B (NFkB) pathway.  Niacin is known to block the translocation of NFKB to nucleus and thus reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We will study these effects of niacin in PD patients by analyzing inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients. It has been documented that PD patients who are on carbidopa treatment have decreased levels of niacin. We have found significant reduction in the niacin index (NAD/NADP ratio) in PD patients compared to age- matched controls, denoting reduced NAD levels and increased oxidative stress. We propose a novel hypothesis that by reducing inflammation, niacin treatment will restore niacin levels along with GPR109A levels and will help improve motor coordination and cognition performances in the PD patients. Specific Aims: The two specific aims of the current proposal are as follows: Aim 1 A: To determine whether niacin supplementation will improve the symptoms of PD patients as correlated by performances in motor coordination and cognitive tests. Aim 1 B: To determine whether up-regulation of GPR109A in PD patients will respond to niacin therapy in reducing inflammatory markers in the CSF. Aim 2: To study the molecular mechanisms related to GPR109A as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic target in in-vitro models."
"9414456","PROJECT 3  Abstract  Hypertension is a strong but modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke. Compared to Whites,  Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) are 3 to 4 times more likely to develop these conditions. They  also manifest at younger ages among NHPIs, and are more likely to be fatal than in the all-races population.  Hypertension prevalence is 70% higher in NHPIs than in Whites, and nearly 50% of NHPIs over the age of 21  have hypertension. Yet, NHPIs are largely absent from research on this topic. Many NHPIs consume diets high  in sodium and sugar. Education on self-care for reducing sodium intake, increasing potassium intake, and  encouraging weight loss, smoking cessation, and physical activity can improve blood pressure (BP). We will  adapt an existing educational intervention to address self-management of hypertension in NHPIs. The multilevel  6-month intervention ? ?Engaging NHPIs and Activating Communities to Take Steps? (ENACTS) ? will operate  use peer-facilitated, self-care BP education delivered weekly for 8 weeks emphasizing healthy diet, traditional  NHPI foods, adherence to medication, and encouragement to increase physical activity and stop smoking; with  text messaging to boost adherence. We will implement ENACTS as a randomized controlled trial at 3 community  sites serving NHPIs in the Puget Sound area of Washington. We will randomize 270 NHPI adults (90 per site)  with a self-reported physician diagnosis of hypertension and elevated BP measured at enrollment to either  ENACTS or usual care. Both groups will receive general health education brochures, plus a $30 weekly credit  for online grocery shopping. We will use a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mobile phone app to track  participants. The primary outcome is change in systolic BP. Secondary outcomes are food purchasing behaviors  (online ordering, grocery receipts); medication adherence; social support; smoking cessation; and GIS data on  daily energy expenditure. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, weekly, and at 6 months. We will also examine  change in household food purchasing patterns, enhanced family support for BP control, and BP improvement  among family members. A subset of intervention participants and family members will be invited to participate in  a program that uses personal photographs for narrative art projects to promote labeling of healthy foods by local  retail outlets. Our Specific Aims are: 1) at the individual level, to compare within-person change in BP and  secondary outcomes between the intervention and control groups; 2) at the family level, to evaluate ENACTS?  effects on BP and secondary outcomes as within-person change in family members who provide primary support,  and as mean change in other adult family members who are not directly engaged in the intervention; and 3) at  the policy level, to evaluate the intervention?s ability to influence grocery store policy on clearly identifying foods  that are low in sodium or high in potassium, some of which might not be easily identified with existing labels (e.g.,  fresh produce). ENACTS combines empirically supported elements of existing programs, thus increasing its  probability of success. It aligns with the American Heart Association?s call for multilevel prevention."
"9503620","PROJECT SUMMARY Effective tick control is an important public health measure for combating Lyme disease. It is generally believed that the majority of Lyme disease cases are acquired from ticks living in the peridomestic landscape, thereby placing responsibility for disease prevention mostly at the local level, and especially on individual householders. Despite several studies documenting effective peridomestic tick control measures, human exposures to ticks are increasingly common and cases of Lyme disease have not been reduced. This project aims to bridge the gap between tick control research and human behavior by 1) assessing the effectiveness of an integrated tick management (ITM) strategy applied to either individual or contiguous residential properties, and 2) identifying patterns of human activity within and outside of the peridomestic landscape that lead to encounters with infected ticks. Our ITM approach will integrate the application of well-timed sprays of tick-killing chemicals (to reduce host-seeking ticks) with installation of rodent-targeted bait boxes (to reduce the prevalence of ticks carrying Lyme- causing germs). This approach will be evaluated simultaneously at properties in Lyme-endemic towns located in western Connecticut and southern Rhode Island. Tick abundance will be compared between treated and untreated properties using standard tick collecting methods. Human tick encounters will be recorded and compared using a novel crowd-sourced reporting system (TickSpotters). Study participants will be asked to document the location of their outdoor activity throughout the day in easy-to-use digital journals. Expected outcomes of this project are a reduction in the number of infected blacklegged ticks and human tick encounters at residences receiving an integrated tick management intervention, and an improved understanding of where people encounter ticks both around human habitations and in public outdoor settings."

"9470517","Project Summary / Abstract  The brain functions as a network across scales. Micro-networks of single cells describe how individual neurons process and integrate information while macro-networks of brain regions are often linked to specific brain functions. However, networks at these different scales are often studied in isolation. Calcium imaging methods have recently enabled simultaneous recordings of hundreds to thousands of neurons with single-cell resolution. Such techniques provide an opportunity to bridge the understanding of networks across scales by recording from a large brain region with single-cell resolution. Network analysis methods have been developed for spiking data in neurons, but because of inherent temporal differences between calcium and spiking dynamics, many current analysis methods for neuronal networks unfit to monitor network changes directly from calcium dynamics. To date, there are no scalable computational analysis methods capable of handling the network dynamics of large calcium imaging datasets. To address this critical need, I propose to develop scalable analysis methods for calcium dynamics in neuronal networks. This will include methods for directly estimating functional network changes quantitatively (Aim 1), as well as classifying neuronal subtypes in a label-free manner (Aim 2). These techniques will be applied to hippocampal data in mice performing a trace conditioning task to highlight how sub-networks of neurons integrate information for different behavioral states (Aim 3). Results of this study will provide novel insights about how neural networks compute during different behavioral states and how sub-networks of neurons coordinate and differentially modulate behavior. Such techniques will provide quantitative and robust methods for probing large neuronal networks to help connect our understanding of neuronal networks at the micro, single cell scale, with what we understand about neuronal networks at the macro, whole brain scale. In addition to carrying out this research proposal, I will receive training to enable me to become uniquely situated as a pioneering researcher at the interface between neuroscience and data science."
"9581305","Abstract Among the 6 racial and ethnic categories recognized by the US Census Bureau, 3 stand out for their similarity in history, demographics, visibility, and health: American Indians (AIs), Alaska Natives (ANs), and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs). NHPIs and AI and ANs (the latter 2 are typically combined) are the smallest and second-smallest US racial groups, with populations of 1.2 and 5.2 million, respectively. These groups experience harsh disparities in health and mortality compared to US Whites. Concerning are their population prevalences of hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and stroke, which are as high as, and usually higher than, US Whites. Despite these serious public health inequities, both groups have been largely neglected by health research. A literature search for interventions targeting blood pressure (BP) control as a contributor to CVD and stroke in AIs, ANs, and NHPIs returned no results. No interventions ? and thus no multilevel intervention studies ? have ever focused on BP control in these groups. Accordingly, the overarching objective of Native-Controlling Hypertension And Risks through Technology (Native-CHART) is to improve control of BP and associated CVD and stroke risk factors among these populations. Our research agenda articulates a practical model of health and health disparities grounded in lived experience as well as in theory. Our community-based participatory approach increases the likelihood that findings will confer sustainable benefits within AI, AN, and NHPI communities, which range from large urban areas to frontier villages in Alaska. Our approach harnesses technologies available in the settings where participants live, work, and obtain healthcare ? including electronic health records, text messaging, online grocery shopping apps, wearable physical activity monitors, and home BP monitors. Our 3 Research Projects feature interventions at the individual, family, community, and policy levels. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) expand and establish new collaborations with research partners across private, tribal, and public constituencies that address BP control within a multilevel intervention framework; 2) develop a multilevel, multisector infrastructure that ensures inclusion of local, regional, and national views on research priorities and approaches to controlling BP; 3) promote a scientifically rigorous, culturally informed program of inquiry that acquires new knowledge to implement innovative approaches to increase hypertension knowledge and awareness, activate patients, increase medication adherence, and improve BP control among AIs, ANs, and NHPIs. Our goal is to move research on BP control and CVD and stroke risk factors in these communities beyond its current, largely descriptive state, and translate that knowledge into meaningful action."

"9437769","ABSTRACT Survivors of first primary breast cancer (BC) have a 2- to 5-fold increased risk of developing a second primary in the opposite breast. The high incidence and improved survival for BC has resulted in increasing numbers (currently nearly 3 million in U.S.) of women at risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC). Studies to date have identified environmental, genetic, and treatment-related risk factors for CBC. However, despite advances in characterizing the etiology of CBC, a large fraction of CBC incidence remains unexplained, hindering the development of effective risk stratification or risk prediction tools which will be pivotal in developing effective CBC prevention, surveillance, and therapeutic strategies for BC survivors.  In the context of CBC risk, first primary tumors reflect the joint effects of environmental exposures and host features, including those that are known and measurable as well as those that are unidentified and/or unmeasurable. Molecular features of first primary tumors could be powerful complementary indicators of risk of CBC. In a strategy designed to advance risk stratification capacity, we will use cutting edge genomic technologies to interrogate first primary tumors in the context of CBC risk. We will also assess the concordance of molecular features in paired first and second primary tumors to elucidate insights into the biology of CBC and potentially shared etiologic mechanisms.  The proposed research builds on the unique resources of the large multi-center WECARE Study of CBC with features including: population-based ascertainment of CBC cases and controls (women with unilateral breast cancer (UBC)); detailed clinical data including treatment of first primary BCs from medical record reviews; extensive risk factor data; germline genetic data from an ongoing GWAS; and mammographic density data. We will obtain tumor blocks for first primary breast tumors of >500 UBC controls and first primary tumors plus contralateral tumors from > 500 CBC cases. Laboratory work will include: pathology reviews; transcriptome-wide molecular profiling of tumors; IHC analyses; and replication analyses.  Our Primary Aim is to identify molecular biomarkers in first primary breast tumors associated with risk of developing a subsequent CBC. We will conduct: RNA-sequencing on first primary tumors; identify the most informative markers; develop a molecular signature associated with CBC and evaluate it jointly with treatment and lifestyle/personal/medical/germline genetic risk factors; and replicate with similar risk factors in an independent sample of > 400 CBC cases and > 400 UBC controls. Our Secondary Aims are to: (1) examine the risk signature in first primary tumors (established in the Primary Aim) in relation to CBC subtype-specific risk; and (2) assess the concordance of gene/transcript expression or alterations and subtypes in paired first primary and contralateral tumors and determine the extent to which lifestyle/personal/medical/germline genetic risk factors and treatment affect the development of marker-concordant CBC."
"9540680","Project Summary/Abstract Individuals suffering from body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) experience peculiar misperceptions of their appearance, most often of the face or head. With convictions of disfigurement and ugliness, they typically have poor insight or even delusional beliefs, as well as obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, anxiety, and depression. These combine to result in significant difficulties in functioning, as well as depression, suicide attempts (25%), and psychiatric hospitalization (50%). Despite this severity, relatively few studies of the neurobiology, or even treatment studies, have been conducted in BDD. This underscores a critical need for research seeking to identify targets for intervention based on pathophysiological mechanisms. To-date, background research conducted by our group has provided early insights into neurobiological mechanisms that may contribute to these perceptual distortions, including prominent abnormalities in visual processing systems. These, along with evidence from neuropsychological and psychophysical tests of visuospatial and visual processing, have contributed to the development of a model of diminished global/holistic processing and enhanced detail processing, attributed to both ?top-down? and ?bottom-up? disturbances in perception. However, there remain gaps in the understanding of the neurobiology that may hinder the rational development of novel and effective treatment strategies. Studies thus far have primarily been cross-sectional and few have explored the effects of visual manipulation in order to probe for dynamic abnormalities. Accordingly, this study aims to illuminate the pathophysiology underlying perceptual distortions in BDD using two novel visual modulation techniques: a) attention modulation (?top-down?) and brief image presentation (?bottom-up?) to probe the visual system. We will enroll 34 individuals with BDD and 34 healthy controls, who will undergo two experiments involving viewing photographs of their face while being scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the attention modulation experiment, they will be given instructions and training to hold their gaze constant in order to increase fixation duration and decrease scanning of appearance details, which we hypothesize will increase dorsal visual stream (global/holistic processing) and decrease ventral visual stream (local/detail processing) activation in the brain. In the second experiment we will test whether brief face viewing time increases activity in dorsal visual areas. Results from this study will advance our understanding of the neurobiological basis of perceptual distortions in BDD and identify neurobiological treatment targets for future testing of novel, translational perceptual retraining treatments."

"9459738","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to determine the role of actin-myosin structural dynamics in the molecular mechanism of muscle contraction. Structures, dynamics, and interactions of myosin and actin are fundamental in understanding mechanisms of contraction and its regulation. We focus on dynamic interactions of actin with the catalytic domain of myosin, and extend this investigation to include myosin's light-chain domain and myosin binding protein-C (CPro). To gain insight into structure-functional correlation, we vary active-site ligands, protein isoforms, phosphorylation, mutation, crosslinking, and drugs. Our approach is distinguished by our emphasis on dynamics as well as structure, and on the elusive weak-binding states of actomyosin as well as the more stable strong-binding states. Our core technology is a unique combination of site-directed protein labeling, coupled with high-resolution and time-resolved spectroscopies, to test and revise detailed mechanistic models for the functional interactions of myosin and actin as they transition from weak- to strong- binding states in force generation. In Aim 1, fundamental structural dynamics of the myosin catalytic domain (CD) is investigated, using probes designed to test and revise mechanistic models of actin-activated force generation with high resolution in real time. We seek to understand temporal and spatial coordination of this complex motor. In Aim 2, allosteric changes propagated from the light chain domain (LCD) through the CD to actin will be mapped by probes, with emphasis on regulation by protein isoform and phosphorylation. Similarly, Aim 3 uses the insights of the first two aims to assess structural dynamics of the actomyosin weak and strong interactions perturbed by the presence, isoform, and phosphorylation of CPro. Feasibility (preparations, preliminary data) has been established independently for all three aims, so they are not restrictively interdependent. Instead, the three aims are synergistic, in that they share reagents and are strategically aligned to strengthen each other with new discoveries. Our 3 aims arise from ten novel hypotheses, based on findings from the previous period, converging toward a new synthesis. The assembled research team brings together a powerful combination of techniques and concepts from molecular genetics and cell culture to biophysical spectroscopy and computational simulation, to solve the molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction and regulation. This project remains grounded in fundamental biophysical mechanisms, but it is increasingly clear that the tools developed in this project can pave the way for design of molecular therapies in muscle disease. Once we understand the functions of actomyosin and its regulation, we can look to control these functions. It is anticipated that by th end of the next funding period, this project will generate the most detailed and cohesive structure-function model of muscle contraction and regulation to date, and projects will spin off involving the rational design of gene and drug therapies. More generally, the lessons learned in this project are applicable to a wide range of problems in the biophysics of muscle and molecular motors."
"9456667","In the last decade, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the care and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose cancers harbor oncogenic kinase alterations such as chromosomal rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). ALK rearrangements define a unique molecular subset of NSCLC with characteristic clinicopathologic features and marked sensitivity to ALK TKIs. Based on recently conducted clinical trials, the standard treatment for advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC consists of sequential treatment with the first-generation ALK TKI crizotinib, followed by a second-generation ALK TKI like ceritinib or alectinib. While patients derive significant clinical benefit from first-and second- generation ALK TKIs, the majority of patients relapse within a few years due to acquired resistance. Recent work has identified a number of secondary ALK resistance mutations that can mediate resistance to second- generation ALK TKIs. These on-target resistance mechanisms are found in about one-half of patients relapsing on a second-generation ALK TKI, and can be overcome in the clinic by the newest third-generation, pan- inhibitory ALK TKI lorlatinib. However, patients who initially respond to lorlatinib still relapse within a year or two due to acquired resistance. Moreover, up to one-half of patients relapsing on a second-generation ALK TKI demonstrate intrinsic resistance to lorlatinib, likely due to the development of off-target, or ALK-independent, resistance mechanisms. As treatment options are extremely limited after failure of multiple ALK TKIs, there is an urgent need to understand resistance so that new and effective therapies can be developed. In this application, we seek to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying both acquired and intrinsic resistance to the third-generation ALK TKI lorlatinib. We will use in vitro generated models of resistance, comprehensive genetic assessment of lorlatinib-resistant patient specimens, and accelerated mutagenesis screens to identify lorlatinib-resistant ALK mutations. We will test whether these mutations are susceptible to other clinically available ALK TKIs. To define ALK-independent mechanisms of resistance, we will perform two independent screens in cell lines derived directly from patient biopsies, one involving combinations of drugs and the other utilizing CRISPR-based genome editing technology. Based on the results, we will design and test novel combinatorial strategies to overcome ALK-independent resistance in vitro and in vivo. As tumor heterogeneity may play an important role in driving the development of resistance, we will evaluate both intra- and inter- tumoral heterogeneity by sequencing single cancer cells, spatially distinct sites of disease obtained at autopsy, and circulating tumor DNA. These results will lay the groundwork for future studies investigating the impact of tumor heterogeneity on TKI response in the clinic. Overall, the proposed studies should lead to fundamental insights into the biology of TKI resistance and to the discovery of actionable mechanisms of resistance that may ultimately translate into highly effective, life-prolonging therapies for our patients."
"9416153","Project Summary/Abstract Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by only a few mutations in the ?-hemoglobin gene (HBB). Individuals with the same mutation can have clinically quite different diseases, from mild with few clinical complications to severe complications such as stroke, leg ulceration, pulmonary hypertension, priapism, and acute chest syndrome. We propose to identify functional genetic variation that leads to the heterogeneity of SCD including ischemic stroke, hypertension, and elevated fetal hemoglobin in a cohort of 2,056 SCD patients from the REDS-III Brazilian SCD cohort. This deeply phenotyped cohort is undergoing whole genome sequencing (WGS) under the auspices of the NHLBI TOPMed program. The TOPMed program provides funding for WGS at the Baylor Genome Sequencing Center and genotype calling will be performed at Dr. Abecasis' lab at University of Michigan, but does not provide resources for analyses that combine WGS with clinical and end point data. The WGS data in this cohort provides a valuable opportunity to understand the genetics of the many comorbid conditions that bedevil SCD patients. This R21 is building on the work on the REDS-III study, which collected the Brazilian cohort between October 2013 and May 2015 to study aspects of transfusion such as determinants of response to transfusion, HIV infection, and alloimmunization. All the phenotypes to be studied here?ischemic stroke, blood pressure, and HbF levels?are secondary to the primary end points. We propose to study the genetics of ischemic stroke in HbSS/HbSB0 patients using whole genome, burden, pathway, and bioinformatics approaches with guidance from previous SCD stroke candidate gene and non- SCD genome-wide studies. We will further study the genetics of blood pressure and hypertension by focusing on all the known complex and Mendelian blood pressure loci (around 250). Finally, building on previous successful genome-wide studies of fetal hemoglobin levels, we will replicate reported findings and conduct genome-wide studies. The team pursuing this opportunity are all REDS-III investigators and pull together the WGS and bioinformatics expertise of Drs. Page (leader of the REDS-III bioinformatics and statistical genetics team), Sun, and Guo; and the disease and medical experience of Drs. Busch (transfusion medicine), Custer (U.S. PI of the Brazilian cohort; transfusion medicine), Shannon (SCD expert), Sabinio (Brazilian PI of the Brazilian co-cohort), and Rich (senior statistical geneticist) to understand and interpret these valuable resources data. They will also work with the TOPMed sickle cell phenotyping working group and other TOPMed investigators."

"9465455","Project Summary Epithelial cells form a physical and biochemical barrier against the vast number of microbes inhabiting the gut. Secretion of mucus and antimicrobial peptides by epithelial cells enhance barrier function and shape the composition of the microbiota. Intestinal epithelial cells also monitor lumenal microbes and transmit information to underlying immune cells to shape mucosal immunity. Within the collective epithelium there are six specialized subsets of cells, including tuft cells. Previously, the function of tuft cells was unknown until our group and two others reported their role in parasite response and mucosal immunity. The mechanistic basis of parasite recognition by tuft cells is poorly understood, as both the receptors and microbial agonists are unknown. To close this knowledge gap, this proposal will build on our observation that tuft cells utilize taste-chemosensation to respond to parasite infections. First, we will identify the taste-chemosensory receptors that detect parasites. In parallel we determine the microbial agonists that stimulate tuft cell taste chemosensation. Using next-generation sequencing and gnotobiotic mice, this study will disentangle the role of the parasite-altered microbiome from direct stimulation of tuft cells by parasites and their products. This project will yield valuable information on specific interactions between tuft cell receptors and their agonists thereby expanding the understanding of taste receptors as novel intestinal microbial recognition receptors. Tuft cells and taste-chemosensation are fundamentally new form of microbial detection in the gut and represent a promising area to develop future therapies targeting intestinal inflammatory disease. In addition the data, training, and knowledge obtained from this proposal are critical for my continued development as an independent investigator."
"9465432","Abstract  Lynch syndrome is an inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome caused by mutation in one of several DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, including MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2, and EPCAM. Women with Lynch syndrome are at high risk for endometrial (uterine) cancer, colon cancer, as well as other tumor types. While there has been significant progress in the understanding of Lynch syndrome associated colon cancer in terms of molecular pathogenesis and risk, Lynch syndrome associated endometrial cancer is less well understood. The lifetime risk of endometrial cancer in women with Lynch syndrome has been estimated near 54%, and may equal or exceed the risk of colorectal cancer. MSH2 is one of the most commonly mutated MMR genes (50- 66%) in Lynch syndrome associated endometrial cancer.  In addressing provocative question #2, we will evaluate mechanisms underlying how endometrial cancer penetrance associated with loss of MSH2 is influenced by patient natural history (exposure to natural or synthetic hormones) and obesity. We have developed a novel, uterine-targeted, MSH2 knockout mouse model of Lynch syndrome that closely mimics the progression to endometrial cancer observed in women. This model enables us to probe molecular mechanisms underlying how these environmental factors change the risk of endometrial cancer in women with Lynch syndrome.  Obesity and exposure to estrogen are associated with increased sporadic (not inherited) endometrial cancer risk and are known to alter endometrial cell growth, growth factor signaling, as well as the immune response and inflammation. We hypothesize that in the absence of MSH2, behaviors/factors that amplify these changes in the endometrium will increase the likelihood of acquiring oncogenic mutations. Conversely, we expect that environmental factors or behaviors that decrease endometrial cell growth and normalize growth factor signaling and immune response (by lowering exposure to detrimental hormones or by maintaining a lean weight and low insulin), will reduce the overall incidence and accumulation of oncogenic mutations, and decrease the penetrance of disease in women with Lynch syndrome.  We will evaluate the molecular changes that occur in the endometrium of normal mice and MSH2 knockout mice in response to hormone exposure and obesity using state-of-the-art tools for molecular profiling. We expect to identify a subset of genes that are targets for mutation in the absence of MSH2, which contribute to the development of endometrial cancer in Lynch Syndrome. We will further examine how changes in the local immune response is altered due to the loss of MSH2 and how this is impacted by hormones and obesity. These findings will be critical to developing effective prevention strategies (both behavioral and pharmaceutical), which can delay or prevent endometrial cancer in these women."
"9414453","DISSEMINATION CORE  Abstract  Most health communication is purposive; yet those purposes are not always clear to intended recipients. We  believe that the use of culturally tailored dissemination methods will result in clear health messaging that will play  a critical role in preventing, detecting, and treating hypertension and other cardiovascular disease (CVD) and  stroke risk factors among American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders. Native-  Controlling Hypertension And Risk through Technology?s (Native-CHART) academic and community partners  present diverse strengths that will help us achieve our shared goal of reducing disparities among these  populations. We will examine how health information is consumed and pilot-test new ways to communicate and  disseminate health information and research findings. These activities will build capacity for new research;  facilitate the exchange of knowledge, practices, and ideas relevant to hypertension; and broaden their uptake by  local, regional, and national academic and community stakeholders. The Dissemination Core will be housed in  the Partnerships for Native Health, a program at Washington State University dedicated to leveraging community  strengths while providing research, education, and technical assistance to diverse constituents. Partnerships for  Native Health has developed 150 collaborations with tribes, tribal organizations, and community-based programs  in the 15 states where we are active. The Dissemination Core will work closely with these partners and with the  Consortium Core. With researchers in Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico,  Oklahoma, and North Carolina, we will create 7 Satellite Centers to facilitate a nationwide presence for Native-  CHART. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) disseminate the results of Intervention Projects to healthcare providers  and systems, governmental agencies, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander  patients, organizations, and communities using culturally-congruent methods and materials through the Satellite  Centers, annual conferences, national meetings, and other venues; 2) disseminate the results of Native-CHART  Projects and Cores to the scientific community to encourage new research collaborations; 3) assist the  Methodology Core in conducting needs assessments with our target communities to identify local priorities  pertinent to blood pressure control, and CVD and stroke risk factors; and 4) publicize activities and opportunities  sponsored by Native-CHART and other agencies that relate to our overall goals, including education, funding,  and technical support. These activities will ensure that Native-CHART efforts are not limited to the local sites  where our Intervention Projects are implemented."
"9534188","PROJECT SUMMARY Persistent, pervasive healthcare disparities disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority communities. Training health professionals to work effectively with people from different cultures; organizational policies, procedures, and practices that address the needs of racial, ethnic, and other underserved populations; and establishing relationships between health organizations and other organizations serving the same populations are critical to equitable care. Culturally competent healthcare can significantly increase the equity of care for racial and ethnic minorities to ultimately reduce health disparities. The goal of proposed Phase II research and development effort is to complete the design and production of JourneyStart, a research-based, computer- assisted cultural competency assessment and action planning toolkit to increase the capacity of small- to medium-sized health organizations to better meet the needs of racial and ethnic minorities. Specifically, the proposed effort will: (1) refine the data functions of JourneyStart; (2) design the technical assistance functions of JourneyStart; and (3) assess the implementation and utility of JourneyStart based on feedback from a sample of small- to mid-sized health organizations that work at the community level. Approximately 15 health organizations will be recruited to test the entire spectrum of services available from JourneyStart, from assessment to action planning, and the interface with the system. Staff from the organizations will participate in an evaluation to discuss the components and utility of system, including (a) ease of the interface and use, (b) limitations, and (c) recommendations for packaging the services. To develop JourneyStart?s benchmarking capability, clusters of organizations will be established based on analysis of the organizations? size, demographics of the people they serve, and geographic location,. The aims of the proposed research align both with the mission of the National Institutes of Health to apply knowledge to enhance health and life and its goal to foster fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and research applications for protecting and improving health. Furthermore, the proposed product will advance the mission of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) to promote minority health and support efforts that reduce health disparities, along with the commitment of NIMHD to support interventions and translational research that address cultural competency and social determinants of health."
"9459950","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood adversity accounts for 50-75% of the population attributable risk for alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and suicide. Recent work has also documented enduring effects of childhood maltreatment on adult neurobiology, including alterations in cortical and limbic structures and reprogramming of HPA-axis mediated stress responses. Notably missing, however, is an understanding of how the potential neurobiological sequelae of chronic childhood adversity shape the vital adult activity of caring for an infant, and how this in turn affects early brain development. The proposed program of research seeks, for the first time, to link processes across neurobiological, neuroendocrine, and behavioral levels to examine how the impact of early adversity is conveyed from mother to child, among 150 mothers and their infants. To accomplish these aims the program is led by multiple principal investigators with specific expertise in: (1) mother-infant communication; (2) neurobiological effects of childhood abuse and (3) neonatal neuroimaging. The first aim of the study is to assess whether adversity- related alterations in structure, function or connectivity of maternal brain regions critical to stress regulation, including the amygdala, hippocampus/subiculum, and medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC), are associated with differences in maternal stress response during an in-scanner psychosocial stress challenge. The second aim is to assess whether childhood adversity is associated with differences in mother's interactions with their infants at 4 and 12 months of age. Finally, we will assess longitudinally the degree to which maternal disrupted communication leads to impairments in infant stress regulation, amygdala hypertrophy and altered functional connectivity at one year of age. A substudy will also evaluate the contribution of prenatal factors including acute and chronic stress hormone measures, maternal psychiatric symptomatology and partner conflict. Childhood adversity and disrupted parenting are the root preventable causes for a host of medical and psychiatric disorders including addiction that result in billions of dollars in health care expenditures. A detailed understanding of underlying mechanisms, critical time points, and mediating factors is necessary to design targeted interventions to preempt the adverse consequences of early adversity. The proposed program of research will provide data on potential early biomarkers for infant risk that are much more specific than broad maternal psychosocial factors and could lead to earlier and more effective identification of, and intervention in, risk-related developmental trajectories."
"9440390","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My project will investigate the mechanisms underlying cerebellar growth failure and apply this understanding to medulloblastoma, a tumor of excess cerebellar growth. These two interrelated conditions are both important sources of medical illness in children. Cerebellar development depends on the regulated growth of a population of neuronal precursor cells called cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs). Failure of these cells to expand their population leads to cerebellar hypoplasia, as seen in the congenital disorder Seckel syndrome. In contrast, excessive proliferation of CGNPs predisposes to medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Although mutation of the DNA repair protein ATR is known to cause Seckel syndrome, the mechanism through which ATR deficiency results in neurodevelopmental defects is still not fully understood. The hypo-plastic phenotype of Seckel syndrome, however, suggests that ATR disruption may be exploited in the treatment of the hyper-plastic disorder medulloblastoma. The goal of this Kirschstein-NRSA individual fellowship (F30) project is to delineate why ATR is required for cerebellar growth and whether ATR disruption may be used in medulloblastoma treatment.  I have found that conditional deletion of ATR in the mouse cerebellum causes widespread DNA damage and cell death in CGNPs, resulting in the formation of small, disorganized cerebella. However, the mechanism by which ATR deficiency leads to CGNP damage and death, and consequently cerebellar hypoplasia, is still unclear. My experiments will use tissues and cells from ATR-deficient mice to reveal where in the cell cycle DNA damage accumulates in CGNPs in response to loss of ATR (Specific Aim 1), and how CGNPs die when they lack ATR (Specific Aim 2). Delineating the mechanism by which CGNPs are damaged and die in response to ATR loss will advance the understanding of Seckel syndrome.  CGNP requirement for ATR, as revealed by Seckel syndrome and as seen in ATR-deficient mice, suggests that ATR may be targeted as a novel therapy for medulloblastoma. My preliminary work shows that genetic deletion of ATR during early development in medulloblastoma-prone mice has a profound anti-tumor effect. I thus propose in Specific Aim 3 to determine if deletion of ATR after the point of tumor formation will have a similar anti-tumor effect. My findings will advance cancer treatment by testing the value of targeting ATR in treating medulloblastoma.  The proposed training and research plans outlined in this NIH F30 fellowship application will provide me with outstanding education in the areas of cell physiology, neuroscience, cancer biology, and molecular pharmaceutics, and promote my professional development toward a career as a physician-scientist."
"9554056","To permit translation of a promising therapy from the research laboratory to a human clinical trial, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires efficacy data, toxicological and pharmacological characterization of the drug, clinical grade drug manufacturing, a well-designed clinical trial protocol, and appropriate institutional approvals. The purpose of the Gene and Virus Therapy Support Resource (GVTSR) is to provide to Mayo Clinic investigators with promising virus-based therapies the resources and expertise in manufacturing and animal testing of recombinant viruses to meet these FDA requirements. The translation of new drugs, including promising virus-based therapies, from the cycles of preclinical research to clinical trials requires expertise and facilities not often found in an academic setting. Thus, the initiation of the clinical trial process can be significantly delayed or completely blocked for the academic researcher /clinician. The Mayo Clinic has established the necessary core resources on-site, the GVTSR, to translate gene and virus research at the Mayo Clinic to Phase l/ll clinical trials. The GVTSR has three components, the Viral Vector Production Laboratory (WPL), the Viral Toxicology Pharmacology Laboratory (VTPL) and Quality Assurance (QA), which work in collaboration with each investigator to fulfill the unique requirements of each project. The WPL has the dedicated facilities and personnel for large-scale virus production, process development, and the manufacture of clinical grade product using Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). The VTPL has specialized equipment and trained personnel to design and conduct toxicological and pharmacological characterization of novel biological products in animal models using Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) in the AAALAC approved Mayo Clinic animal care facilities. The QA unit assures the quality of the procedures and results of the GVTSR. Over the past five years, the GVTSR has been directly involved in the translation of four new MCCC research projects to Phase I clinical trial and the support of four other Phase II clinical trials originally translated with GVTSR support ."
"9541216","PROJECT SUMMARY Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that causes a range of diseases and is one of the major infectious agents responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia. In order for A. baumannii to cause disease, it must acquire nutrient zinc from its environment and compete with the host for this essential metal. Keeping with this, A. baumannii upregulates a variety of zinc acquisition genes in response to nutrient limitation. A highly induced gene during zinc limitation encodes a putative D-alanine-D-alanine carboxypeptidase which we have named zrlA, which is an enzyme class involved in peptidoglycan remodeling. While these carboxypeptidases are broadly classified as being involved in cell wall maintenance, their importance in bacterial pathogenesis and their contribution to nutrient acquisition is not well-defined. Genetic inactivation of zrlA results in a significant growth defect during zinc limitation and reduces fitness in a murine model of pneumonia. Furthermore, this strain is extremely sensitive to antibiotic exposure, suggesting that ZrlA contributes to both nutrient zinc homeostasis and maintaining the barrier function of the cellular envelope. Therefore, we predict that ZrlA is specifically induced during zinc starvation to modify peptidoglycan in an effort to promote zinc acquisition and provide resistance to extracellular stress. This prediction will be tested through two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, the contribution of ZrlA to overcoming zinc starvation will be determined by assessing alterations in zinc acquisition systems and uptake. Experiments proposed in Specific Aim 2 will more specifically dissect the impact of ZrlA on peptidoglycan architecture and cellular integrity. This aim will combine biochemical techniques with advanced microscopy to determine structural components of the bacterial cell envelope and the niche in which ZrlA contributes to this shape. Taken together, these findings will have broad implications for understanding the mechanism bacterial pathogens employ to acquire zinc despite nutrient limitation within the vertebrate host, and provide exciting targets for antimicrobial therapy development involving bacterial metal acquisition."
"9600128","Contact PD/PI: Buse, John B NRSA-Training-001 (001) J. Training Core Abstract Collaborative interdisciplinary teams are critical to achieve and translate high impact science, yet multiple fields of expertise, each having its own language and culture, must be integrated and coordinated to achieve the goal of translation. To diminish barriers to translational efficiency, innovative training programs are needed to develop a cadre of researchers with the skills to `speak the language' across the translational continuum. UNC possesses the resources and commitment to develop innovative strategies to address this critical training need. This emerging translational research workforce will become key team members and leaders who bridge current divides across disciplines and setting, adapt methods and approaches from different disciplines and integrate them into research, and effectively communicate with a broad group of stakeholders. In our view, three core milestones are central to the translation of biomedical discoveries: (1) moving discoveries through the process of commercialization/entrepreneurship; (2) evaluating products in clinical trials; and (3) bringing discoveries or evidence-based practices into integrated health systems. We propose a new TL1 postdoctoral training program focused toward track-specific immersion in one of these three translational themes. We have chosen the tracks in this program because they are in alignment with the goals of TraCS and the NIH. We will leverage existing programs and expertise including those of TraCS, the Carolina Health Informatics Program (CHIP) and Computational Biology programs, the clinical trials infrastructure, our Partnership for Entrepreneurial Commercialization of UNC Chapel Hill Technology, and the UNC Health Care System. The experienced Training Core Leadership Team will be joined by: (1) faculty mentors who have the scientific and/or clinical content expertise to further translate this product or idea, (2) resource experts whose primary responsibilities are to operationalize translation, and (3) discipline-specific informatics experts who can direct the trainee to informatics methods and resources relevant to their project. Our overarching goal is: to train a cadre of postdoctoral fellows who wish to become translational scientists by immersing them in the translation of research products within one of three tracks in the translational pipeline? clinical trials, commercialization and entrepreneurship, or health systems. We will accomplish this goal by: (1) providing fellows with the didactic and experiential training to develop and apply skills in their targeted area to become leaders and effective members of translational research teams, and (2) increasing retention in translational science by facilitating transition of fellows to individual research training awards, employment or other appropriate mechanisms of research support. Effective translation is a ?team sport?, and our goal is to create a training environment that includes the best science coupled with effective operationalization required for translation. This training will prepare TL1 fellows to serve as leaders across the translational pipeline who can both coalesce and manage future teams.

"9573958","With this application we request funds from the ORD Shared Equipment Evaluation Program (ShEEP) to purchase a new super resolution confocal microscope system as a shared resource to be housed in the Neurology Program laboratories on the 6th floor of the San Diego VA Medical Center. Specifically, we seek to obtain a model LSM 880 with Airyscan manufactured by Carl Zeiss USA, Inc. (Thornwood, NY). The rationale for this purchase is threefold. First, Current confocal microscope systems available through the San Diego VAMC Microimaging Core Facility (Zeiss LSM 510) and the Center for Neural Repair (Olympus FV1000) are both over 15 years old, are well over their operational lifetimes and as of September 2016 are obsolete and no longer supported by the manufacturers. Going forward, parts and maintenance will no longer be available and these microscopes, which are critical to the research goals of many VA investigators, will become unusable. Second, we are able to take advantage of a time-limited 20% trade-in offer from Zeiss for the purchase of the LSM 880 with Airyscan system. Third, the LSM 880 with Airyscan has many advanced features that place it at the cutting edge of confocal microscopy, including features that are not available from any other manufacturer. Therefore, the acquisition of an LSM 880 with Airyscan confocal microscopy system will dramatically enhance the imaging capabilities available to many VA investigators and support the most demanding research goals. This will certainly stimulate the development of new research projects and new collaborations among investigators at the San Diego VAMC, which has a long-standing record of excellence in research to benefit Veterans health. The research portfolio of the major and minor users for this instrument is very diverse and includes projects studying regenerative approaches to spinal cord injury and neural repair as well as studies investigating the cellular and molecular biology of ageing, gene therapy for Alzheimer's disease as well as for cardiac disease, traumatic brain injury, psychiatry, cardiology, anesthesiology, neurodegeneration, stem cell biology, diabetes and blindness. Access to the most advanced confocal microscopy tools and techniques is critical to all of these studies, as they all involve the collection of large amounts of quantitative image information across a large spatial, temporal and spectral dynamic range from a diverse set of living and fixed biological samples with the highest resolution and speed possible. Specifically, research groups and projects for which the LSM 880 with Airyscan will be critical are: Dr Mark Tuszynski, Dr John Brock, Dr Paul Lu, Dr Brian Head, Dr Robert Rissman, Dr Hemal Patel, Dr Thomas Hnasko, Dr Allen Ryan, Dr Steven Wagner, Dr Dhakshin Ramanathan and Dr Veronica Shubayev, Dr Kirk Hammond and Dr Ephron Rosenszweig. Thus, acquisition of an LSM 880 with Airyscan will not merely maintain confocal microscopy at the San Diego VA Medical Center. Rather, this cutting edge technology will help to ensure that we remain leaders in our respective fields at the forefront of research to improve Veteran's health."
"9616452","Executive Summary of Predicate SBIR/STTR Phase I Grant and Team  Asystbio Laboratories LLC proposes to market a genomics test called AML-MutationCounter to count somatic mutations in genes that contribute to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have developed a custom set of reagents and proprietary computer programs for application of next-generation DNA sequencing to count AML-driving gene mutations in blood or bone marrow cells. Every year AML afflicts 20,000 Americans with nearly 10,000 dying from the disease. Many patients respond to primary therapy and achieve clinical remission. Remission is currently determined by a reduction of leukemic blasts in bone marrow to <5% of cells. A more sensitive and specific test for remission may guide clinicians to achieve more durable remission and improve stratification of patients for likelihood of relapse. One recent study found that forty eight percent of patients in remission retained AML gene mutations in >5% of marrow or blood cells and these patients? survival was on average 25% of that seen in patients who cleared mutant alleles to <5% of cells during remission. Thus, the presence of gene mutations as an index of residual disease at remission was highly prognostic of survival.  Studies in our Phase I STTR grant involve a collaboration between Asystbio Laboratories LLC and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to produce a genomics test for measuring somatic mutations in a custom panel of 40 genes known to be recurrently mutated in AML. Studies in Aim 1 will establish the accuracy, sensitivity and reproducibility of the test for quantification of mutant allele frequencies using standard reference lymphoid cell lines. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) present in 50% and 100% of alleles in our 40-gene panel are diluted to 1.25% and 2.5% in a solution of wildtype alleles. We will determine the accuracy of our tool kit to detect these variant (i.e., mutant) alleles. Studies in Aim 2 will apply the tool kit to 10 patient samples that were collected at the time of remission before a subsequent recurrence of leukemia within 4 years and 5 samples from patients at remission who did not relapse within 4 years. We expect to show that at remission our test detects mutations in AML-associated genes in patients who were destined to relapse and non-relapsing patients have lower or null mutation frequencies.  To date we have created customized reagents to prepare DNA sequencing libraries consisting of amplified segments of exons from 40 genes that are known to be recurrently mutated in AML. We use the HaloPlexHS library preparation technology of Agilent Corporation which includes exon capture by solution hybridization and molecular tagging of both strands of DNA duplexes in the target genes. Duplex consensus sequencing reduces the background of called variants by removing mutations that occurred during library preparation and sequencing. The molecular tag provides a precise count of the mutant allele frequency. We have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) that are present in 1.25% and 2.5% of alleles are correctly identified at near the appropriate frequencies using HaloPlexHS DNA sequencing technology and our company?s proprietary bioinformatic algorithms. Of 9 recognized snps in the target gene panel, 8 were detected in both duplex strands after 1/40 dilution.  The I-Corps? Team consists of Gene Howington, J.D. - C-level Corporate Officer (President and COO of Asystbio Laboratories), Dr. William Kaufmann - PI (Adjunct Professor at UNC Chapel Hill and CSO of Asystbio Laboratories) and Tom Powers ? Industry Expert. The rationale for the formation of this team is the combination of their skills in science, contracting, market research and project management is integral to determining market scale and viability, defining the approach to reach said market, and designing and implementing processes that allow Asystbio Laboratories to get AML- MutationCounter to market in a cost-competitive and profitable manner.  All members selected for the I-Corps? Team are able to meet the time and travel requirements of the training programs. The team will benefit, as will the company, from greater refinement of the potential market for our diagnostic product allowing for greater efficacy in the design and deployment of production systems and marketing plans. We also benefit from the expansion of the base of professional contacts needed to get this product to market and build a strong industry base for the future expansion of the company through new lines of business as they develop."

CINJ is currently comprised of 161 members from a total of 32 academic departments who hold over $92.9 million total peer-reviewed support, $61.1 million annual direct support, $28.9 million total NCI support and $18.7 million annual direct NCI support (a 20% Increase in NCI support since the time ofthe last submission in 2004). Since the appointment of Dr. Robert S. DiPaola as center director in September, 2008, accrual onto investigator initiated therapeutic clinical trials has more than doubled; 17 new faculty were recruited in multiple areas including Basic Science, Clinical Science, Public Health Science, and Systems Biology/Bioinformatics; the Consortium relationship with Princeton University and Rutgers University was strengthened and formalized; the State's cancer registry and SEER contract was moved to CINJ; and an additional four recruitment searches were launched. CINJ now has six established Research Programs: Cell Death and Survival Signaling; Genomic Instability and Tumor Growth; Cancer Pharmacology and Preclinical Therapeutics; Clinical Investigations; Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention; and Cancer Prevention and Control. CINJ supports 14 Shared Resources, including: Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; Functional Genomics; Transgenic and Knockout Mouse; Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics; Histopathology and Imaging; Biorepository Service; Bioinformatics; Biometrics; Research Pharmacy; Office of Human Research Services; Centralized Education and Training for Clinical Research Personnel; Small Animal Imaging (developing); Metabolomics (developing) and Epidemiology Services (developing). Overall, CINJ has a unique niche among NCI-designated centers, as it benefits from opportunities as a matrix cancer center and at the same time has State-wide authority beyond the University matrix, thus establishing an environment to foster and formalize a Vision of Transdisciplinary and Translational Research within and beyond the University matrix. We are requesting CCSG support for Senior leadership, Program Leadership, Planning and Evaluation, Developmental Funds, Administration, Shared Resources, Protocol Review and Monitoring, Protocol Specific Research Support, and Data and Safety Monitoring."
"9432520","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 150 different types of epithelial cells perform essential vectorial functions required for homeostasis and survival of the organism. A key property underlying these functions is polarity, i.e. the ability of epithelial cells to localize different transporters, channels and hormone receptors to opposite (apical and basolateral) domains of their plasma membrane (PM). The experiments proposed will utilize state of the art molecular, biochemical and microscopic techniques to elucidate molecular sorting mechanisms that regulate the trafficking of molecules essential for epithelial polarity and kidney function/pathobiology. The proposed experiments follow up on our group's recent findings that clathrin plays a broad role of clathrin in basolateral protein sorting and that the ubiquitous (AP-1A) and epithelial-specific (AP-1B) clathrin adaptors carry out complementary basolateral sorting functions in MDCK cells. As we have shown that kidney proximal tubule (KPT) lacks the basolateral sorting adaptor AP-1B, Specific aim 1 will investigate in detail the roles of clathrin adaptors AP-1A, AP-3, AP-4 and GGAs in basolateral sorting in KPT using a domain-selective biotinylation, mass spectroscopy and biochemical and live-imaging trafficking assays. Specific aim 2 will investigate a novel role of clathrin and clathrin adaptors in the apical sorting of Megalin. We have recently described the complete apical recycling pathway of Megalin and our preliminary data suggest that the apical localization of this protein requires clathrin. Specific am 3 will investigate the mechanisms involved in the basolateral sorting of E-cadherin, a fundamental epithelial polarity protein. We will follow up on preliminary data indicating that the basolateral sorting of E-cadherin depends on both AP-1A and AP-1B in the recycling but not in the biosynthetic route, to search for novel TGN and endosomal basolateral sorting mechanisms that depend on sorting signals in the tightly associated protein beta-catenin. Specific aim 4 will characterize the sorting mechanisms of copper transporters A7P7A and ATP7B, highly similar molecules which reside in the TGN in low copper and are released to the PM in low copper. The studies proposed will contribute to a deeper understanding of fundamental epithelial trafficking mechanisms and human (including kidney) diseases associated with malfunction of the molecules under study in this proposal."
"9671669","Centella asiatica (CA) is a botanical remedy, reputed to enhance memory and brain function. Cognitive effects of CA have been reported in rodents and in humans. In our preclinical studies, CA water extract (CAW) improved cognition in both the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in wild type (WT) mice. CAW upregulated mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) gene expression in multiple brain regions of treated mice. In vitro, CAW increased ETC gene expression, ATP levels and oxidative phosphorylation in human neuroblastoma cells and mouse primary neurons. CAW also upregulated antioxidant response element gene expression in these in vivo and in vitro models. Since mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are strongly associated with disease progression in AD, we hypothesize that CA will reduce cognitive decline in AD patients by increasing brain mitochondrial biogenesis and/or function, and reducing oxidative stress. Active compounds in CA include triterpenes and caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs). Our ultimate goal is to develop a CA product standardized to these actives, as a botanical agent to slow cognitive decline in AD. Towards this goal, the present proposal seeks to (a) identify biological signatures of target engagement by CA in humans (R61 phase) and (b) demonstrate an association of these signatures with a clinical effect on cognition (R33 phase). The R61 project will first examine the pharmacokinetics of CA triterpenes and CQAs, and changes in plasma total antioxidant capacity, following oral intake of a CA product (with known triterpene and CQA content) in 10 cognitively normal, elderly subjects (age 65-85). This will confirm bioavailability of CA compounds and inform dosage decisions. CA product will then be administered, at three escalating doses for four weeks each, to elderly subjects with normal cognition (n=16) and others (n=16) with either amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD. Tolerability and adverse events at each CA product dose will be noted. Brain mitochondrial activity will be assessed by measuring N-acetylaspartate and high energy phosphate metabolites using 1H and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Antioxidant status will be measured as plasma and urine 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine levels. Significant changes from baseline in MRSI signals and/or oxidative status will be considered a biological signature of CA's activity. The subsequent R33 project will compare CA product and placebo, in subjects with MCI/mild AD (n=24 per treatment group). Subjects will receive the maximum tolerated dose giving a biological signal in the R61 study (or placebo) for 24 weeks. Cognitive assessments and plasma F2-isoprostane levels (for antioxidant status) will be evaluated in addition to the R61 biological signatures. We will compare changes in biological signatures induced by CA product versus placebo, and determine their strength of association with any cognitive effects observed. The R61 and R33 phases will include equal numbers of male and female subjects, to assess gender dependent effects of CA. If successful, this project will lead to a larger clinical trial of the cognitive effects of the CA product in MCI or AD subjects."

"9643881","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has been a major cause of morbidity in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In both theatres of operation, blast exposure has been the most common cause of TBI. One striking feature of the clinical presentations of OIF/OEF veterans with mTBI is the prominence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Indeed the high prevalence of PTSD and depression in returning OIF/OEF veterans with mTBI is well documented and distinction between the two disorders has proven clinically challenging. The association between PTSD and mTBI might be explained by co-incident exposures to TBI events and PTSD stressors. However, an alternative hypothesis that we have been exploring is that blast-related mTBI damages brain structures that are important in mediating responses to psychological stressors and thus enhances the likelihood of developing PTSD.  In collaboration with a Department of Defense investigator, Dr. Stephen Ahlers, we have been studying a rat model of blast injury that mimics mTBI. We have found that animals tested several months post-exposure exhibit PTSD-related traits including increased acoustic startle, increased anxiety, an altered response to a predator scent challenge and an increased cued response in a fear conditioning paradigm. These observations suggest that blast exposure in the absence of any psychological trauma induces PTSD related traits that are chronic and persistent. Dr. Ahlers has found that plasma corticosterone levels become elevated after blast exposure and that these levels remain high for at least one month. PTSD is commonly thought to result from an abnormal and prolonged stress response with abundant evidence suggesting that abnormalities in the hypothalamic/pituitary/adrenal axis are chronically present.  These observations have lead us to postulate that blast injury to the brain induces a chronic state of stress that even in the absence of any psychological trauma produces PTSD-related traits and exaggerated responses to subsequent PTSD-related stressors. Here we will examine whether stress responses in the brain are chronically altered by exposure to blast injury and determine whether treatment with a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist is able to block the development of or reverse PTSD-related behavioral traits. We will also examine whether blast injury induces structural effects in the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, the principal anatomic substrates that are thought to underlie the neurobiological basis of PTSD. These studies will further understanding of the relationship of blast injury to PTSD related traits and will have implications for designing treatment strategies for veterans who have suffered blast induced mTBIs."
"9435140","Almost all archaea and half of bacteria contain Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) adaptive immune systems that protect them against foreign genetic elements invasion. While diverse, all CRISPR-Cas function through three common steps: (i) adaptation, i.e., acquisition of foreign DNA segments (spacers) into CRISPR arrays; (ii) CRISPR array transcription and transcript processing to produce mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), and (iii) interference, when Cas effector enzymes are guided by crRNAs to matching targets leading to target cleavage and ultimate invader genome destruction. As any immune system, CRISPR-Cas must be capable of self/non-self discrimination to prevent autoimmune death of the host caused by acquisition of spacers from own DNA followed by self-interference. A remarkable mechanism of self/non-self discrimination called ?priming? operates in type I CRISPR-Cas systems: acquisition of spacers from DNA containing partial matches to pre-existing CRISPR array spacers is dramatically stimulated compared to acquisition from DNA devoid of such sequences. While partially matching crRNAs that promote primed adaptation are incapable of efficient interference, all components of the interference machinery are required for primed adaptation. The mechanistic relationship between the interference and adaptation modules of CRISPR-Cas response during primed adaptation is not clear. In this work, protein-nucleic acid complexes and nucleic acid intermediates of CRISPR interference and primed adaptation by the Type I CRISPR- Cas system of Escherichia coli, the best-studied microbe, will be characterized in vivo and in vitro, and host functions that affect both processes will be revealed. In addition to uncovering a functional link between CRISPR interference and primed adaptation, programmable effector complexes with expanded targeting potential will be created as a result of proposed work and highly sensitive quantitative biophysical methods to study effector-target interactions will be developed."
"9673650","PROJECT SUMMARY The UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals for 2020 represents an ambitious strategy to end the AIDS epidemic. The third target envisions 90% of all patients receiving antiretroviral therapy to be virally suppressed. In 2013, WHO recommended the transition to viral load (VL) monitoring for all patients on ART for more than 6 months and at least at 12-month intervals thereafter. While VL testing is the gold standard of HIV treatment monitoring, it is not routinely available and employed in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). WHO estimates that only 20% of patients on ART were receiving VL testing in most LMICs. Nigeria, with a population of 180 million, has the second highest burden of HIV in the world. As of 2014, 747.382 Nigerians were on ART, with just under 50% coverage of those considered eligible for treatment. With only 25 VL instruments in the country, it is clear that additional VL capacity is required and we believe that at least some of this need could be rationally filled with the use of point of care (POC) VL technology. . This proposal seeks to optimize VL monitoring in response to objective 6 of this RFA. We propose a randomized control trial of the Simple Amplification-Based Assay (SAMBA) semi-quantitative (SQ) monitoring versus standard of care (SOC) VL monitoring in patients newly initiating ART. We have recently demonstrated excellent performance of the Simple Amplification-Based Assay (SAMBA) semi- quantitative (SQ) HIV-1 VL test, which has the added benefit of providing results in 90 minutes from a finger prick blood sample, in Nigeria. We hypothesize that use of a POC VL will result in increased viral suppression rates as well as improved adherence and retention rates for patients on ART. A tertiary teaching hospital in North-Central Nigeria, Jos University Teaching Hospital, and a secondary district hospital, Comprehensive Health Centre, Zamko, that currently accesses VL monitoring through a networked approach are our proposed trial sites. The specific aims of the proposed project are to:  1. Compare the 12-month outcomes of patients monitored with POC VL versus SOC VL  2. Compare the retention and adherence rates in patients monitored with POC VL versus SOC VL, with a  sub-aim of comparing drug resistant mutation patterns in patients that fail 1L ART by month 12 of treatment.  3. Determine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing POC VL monitoring The proposed trial will provide the first evaluation of a POC VL monitoring program in a relevant ART setting, the results will help inform priorities for the implementation of POC VL in Nigeria and other LMICs."

Paskett, PhD, MSPH and Mary Ellen Wewers, RN, PHD, MPH, has 52 members from 19 OSU departments within the OSU Colleges of Medicine, Public Health, Arts and Sciences, Law, Nursing, Education and Human Ecology, Dentistry, and Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, as well as Nationwide Children's Hospital and Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Program members provide a wealth of behavioral, basic, clinical, policy, outcomes, and social scientific knowledge and expertise not only to the CC Program, but to the OSUCCC as a whole. The overall CC Program goal is to conduct research to reduce the incidence, mortality and morbidity of cancer, which is accomplished by employing a transdisciplinary research team approach. The Specific Aims of the CC Program are to: 1) Identify molecular, genetic, and behavioral factors related to cancer incidence and mortality; 2) Develop and test behavioral interventions to prevent or detect cancer early; and, 3) Assess and intervene on issues of cancer survivorship. An additional developing aim of the CC Program is to address policy in relation to cancer prevention, detection, and care. Within these aims, research focuses on cross-cutting themes including underserved/minority populations within our catchment area, communication research, tobacco use and toxicity (including regulatory science), and behavioral strategies that capitalize on our members' strengths, such as epidemiology, biology and behavior. The program now has 2 NCI P50-funded Centers, both showcasing not only our multi-level focus but also the transition from observational to interventional studies. In addition, many of our interventions, e.g., Patient Navigation and Bio-Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Stress after Breast Cancer, have been incorporated into clinical care. Moreover, our research has contributed to policy changes, most notably the establishment of a smoke-free campus at OSU. During this past funding period (2009 - 2014), the Program members published a total 611 articles in peer-reviewed journals of which 32% have intra-programmatic collaboration, 20% have inter-programmatic collaborations, and 404 (66%) of the publications represent multi-institutional collaborations. Many of these publications fall within each of these categories bringing the total collaborative publications to 85%. CC Program funding stands at $6.8M of which $6.2M is peer-reviewed funding and of that, $3.9M (63%) is NCI funding. CC Program investigators have enrolled 9,205 participants to research studies over the last 5 years, 64% to externally peer-reviewed studies and 34% to institutional studies, 1.2% to cooperative trial group studies and 0.8% to industry studies. Of these, 6,964 (76%) were enrolled on interventional studies and 2,241 (24%) on non-interventional studies. Future goals focus on increasing research in: 1) policy, allowing us to take advantage of health care policy initiatives; 2) molecular and genetic epidemiology and 3) patient outcomes, fostering more inter-programmatic research with clinicians."
"9657868","Motile cilia are present in the epithelial cells of brain ventricles, trachea, oviduct, and sperm flagella. They play important roles in vivo including maintaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, clearing particles and pathogens from the respiratory tract, and sperm motility. Defects in motile cilia result in multiple diseases such as hydrocephalus, situs inversus, male infertility and et al. Most motile cilia have a ?9+2? axoneme. The shared structure of motile cilia in different tissues suggests that common regulatory mechanisms exist to govern expression of cilia/flagellar components. We hypothesize that expression of the genes essential for motile cilia structure/function are regulated by similar mechanisms so that the proteins are assembled into the motile cilia in a coordinated and timely manner. Sperm flagella are special motile cilia. Besides the core axoneme, other accessory structures are also assembled during spermiogenesis, the process of spermatid differentiation. During this phase, a number of genes essential for sperm flagella assembly are up-regulated. However, the transcriptional regulation of this suite of genes is poorly understood. By analyzing putative transcription factor binding sites in the promoter regions of genes that are essential for sperm flagella structure/function, we identified SOX5 as a putative key controller of cilia/flagellar genes. Sox-5 is a member of a family of genes that shows homology to the high motility group (HMG) box region of the testis determining gene, SRY. The mouse Sox5 gene encodes two major transcripts: the longer Sox5 isoform, originally named L-Sox5, but most authors refer it as Sox5; and a shorter isoform, S-Sox5. The first exon of the S-Sox5 transcript is a non-translated exon;, and it is not present in the L-Sox5 transcript. The translated 48 kDa S-SOX5 protein lacks the N-terminal half of the 84 kDa L-SOX5 protein. The two SOX5 proteins have different tissue distributions. L-SOX5 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the cartilage, heart, brain, kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle, but not in the testis, and it plays important roles in regulating processes of embryonic development and cell fate determination. S-SOX5 protein is only expressed in tissues with motile cilia, including the brain, lungs, and particularly in the testis. In the testis, it is localized in the nuclei of post-meiotic round spermatids. It has been shown that S-SOX5 regulates expression of several genes highly expressed in the testis. We hypothesize that S-SOX5 regulates expression of a suite of genes that are essential for sperm flagella formation and function. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims:1. To establish the critical the role of S-SOX5 in flagellogenesis and male fertility; and 2. To establish the target genes regulated by S-SOX5 in male germ cells. The proposed studies will help clarify the combinatorial transcription factor code that governs the differentiation and structural transformation of mammalian male germ cells. The tools that will be developed in pursuit of the proposed research will allow us to expand the project to a RO1 application to elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms that control mammalian sperm maturation."
"9650932","Abstract Mechanisms of mindfulness for smoking cessation: optimizing quantity and quality. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S., costing more than $193 billion in health care costs and lost productivity annually. There is a growing body of evidence that mindfulness training (MT) is effective for addictions, including alcohol and nicotine use disorders. Early results suggest that on a psychological level, MT may target the link between craving and smoking. In other words, mindfulness may help individuals ?ride out? cravings instead of getting caught up in them - without smoking. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the efficacy of MT for addictions are unknown. We have developed a mobile app-based MT program for smoking cessation, which has shown preliminary efficacy in smoking cessation (Craving to Quit, C2Q). Mobile trainings such as this are ideal for providing standardized delivery of treatment, which helps minimize variability when studying underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Given their electronic platforms, these tools can also be more easily monitored for adherence and adapted for refinement. We have also developed a real-time EEG neurofeedback device that can provide source-estimated feedback from specific brain regions. This is now being tested in clinical trails to examine if it can augment mindfulness acquisition in individuals who are taking Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). However, this technology has not been tested in clinical populations or for specific conditions or disorders. Bringing all of these elements together, we now have an opportunity to (1) determine the mechanism of mindfulness in cue-induced smoking; (2) test strategies to enhance engagement in mobile MT; and (3) determine if neurofeedback can strengthen identified mechanisms of MT. In the proposed study, Aim 1 will determine if mindfulness training alters neural correlates of cue reactivity in smokers. To achieve this, smokers will be randomized to receive MT (C2Q) vs. an active control (experience sampling). Cue-induced PCC activity will be measured pre- and post- training. Aims 2 and 3 will optimize treatment engagement and quality of mindfulness skills. This proposed phased research approach will be the first to uncover the neurobiological mechanisms of mindfulness for smoking (and potentially addiction more broadly). It will utilize these results to refine both quantity and quality of mobile MT while providing preliminary evidence that the modulated mechanisms of mindfulness are associated with clinical benefits, including smoking cessation."
"9334625","After initial mechanical insult, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is characterized by a dynamic process of secondary injury that involves chronic neuroinflammation which is implicated in long-term cognitive and motor impairments and impacts recovery of function. Complement activation is a major component of the inflammatory cascade, and there is increasing evidence that complement plays a role in propagating injury after TBI, at least in the acute phase. However, complement can also contribute to homeostatic and reparative mechanisms after brain injury, and we have demonstrated in a stroke model that the alternative pathway is an optimal target for therapy because its inhibition reduces pathologic amplification of complement activation, but does not interfere with other complement pathways thought to be important for maintenance of homeostatic activity and reparative mechanisms in the CNS. Based on our work in stroke models and preliminary data in a TBI model, in this pilot study we will investigate the characteristics of the chronic inflammatory response after murine TBI (controlled cortical impact, CCI) and investigate the effects of chronically administered alternative complement pathway inhibitors that are specifically targeted to the site of brain injury by different strategies. In addition, based on our data showing a cooperative effect of complement inhibition and rehabilitation therapy, we will determine the effects of combining site-targeted complement modulation and rehabilitation therapy on long-term cognitive and motor recovery after murine CCI. Successful accomplishment of our aims will provide a strong rationale and establish the feasibility for a Merit proposal for detailed mechanistic studies into the role of C in the chronic neuroinflammatory response after TBI, and the role of the neuroinflammatory response in brain injury, repair and experience-driven (rehab) neural plasticity. These studies will also set the stage for a more detailed preclinical evaluation of an identified candidate drug."

This will result in sustainable programs in AK and MT that will result in improved health of these state's Native communities."
"9539023","Project Summary: Efficient Methods for Imputation, Dimensionality Reduction, and Visualization of Single Cell RNA-Sequencing data Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is revolutionizing the study of gene expression. In contrast to bulk RNA- sequencing, where the average expression of all cells in a sample is measured, scRNA-seq allows researchers to measure gene expression in each cell individually. This new technology has profound implications for both basic and clinical research but also presents unique analytic challenges. Among them is the problem of scale: scRNA- seq datasets are growing exponentially in size, with recently developed droplet-based technologies already profiling over 1 million cells in a single experiment. When applied to data of this scale, the most common methods for dimensionality reduction and visualization of scRNA-seq data, principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (t-SNE), require many hours of processing on servers with large amounts of memory. Furthermore, scRNA-seq technologies attempt to measure the extremely small amount of RNA in individual cells, resulting in a phenomenon called ?dropout,? in which a gene is expressed but not detected and hence incorrectly measured as being unexpressed. In this fellowship, specifically tailored and highly scalable analysis methods for scRNA-seq data will be developed: 1) An ultra-fast, out-of-core implementation of randomized PCA allowing for anyone with a standard laptop to perform PCA of even the largest datasets. 2) An improved implementation of t-SNE that incorporates recent theoretical results and that will also use a numerical approximation called fast multipole methods to dramatically accelerate its runtime. 3) A method for imputing ?dropped out? gene expression using recent results from the theory of low-rank matrix completion. In summary, this research will provide practical tools for analysis and visualization of scRNA-seq data. The fellowship also includes a training plan with valuable learning experiences for the applicant?s development as a physician-scientist who can apply computational and mathematical methods to solving biomedical problems."
"9540353","Project Summary/Abstract  Global incidence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) has reached epidemic proportions, and increasing evidence indicates that dysfunctional adipose tissue is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of T2D. Expanding catabolic adipocyte phenotypes within adipose tissues through adrenergic activation improves energy balance and insulin sensitivity. In order to exploit this remodeling of adipose tissue for therapeutic benefit, we need to understand the mechanisms by which adrenergic signaling expand the population of catabolic adipocytes in vivo.  Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic organ and experimental activation of BAT in rodents improves metabolic profiles in models of T2D. BAT is also present in adult humans, where cold-induced activity is correlated with metabolic health. However, the amount of human BAT is highly variable and has low thermogenic activity. Therefore, in order to expand the thermogenic activity of BAT in humans, it is necessary to understand the source of new brown adipocytes and how they are recruited and maintained in adult mammals.  BAT neogenesis is the principal means by which cold exposure expands thermogenic capacity, and thus cold-induced neogenesis provides a physiologically relevant model of brown adipogenesis in vivo. Previous work from our lab has demonstrated that brown adipogenesis occurs within a spatially defined tissue zone and involves the proliferation of adipocytes progenitors, tissue monocytes/macrophages, capillary endothelial cells, as well as an uncharacterized population of stromal cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to deconstruct the neogenic zone in adult BAT, and to test specific mechanisms by which adrenergic signaling induces BAT neogenesis.  We proposed to use single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to deconstruct the cell types present in the brown neogenic zone in a comprehensive and unbiased fashion. Single cell profiling over the course of cold-induced neogenesis will define the cell types involved, and identify the differentiation trajectories of activated brown adipocyte progenitors in vivo. In addition, we will address specific mechanisms by which neural activation triggers tissue expansion using novel genetic loss-of-function analyses.  The project will not only significantly advanced our understanding of the composition of brown adipose tissue and how beta adrenergic receptor activation leads to neogenesis in vivo, but will introduce new and innovative tools to the field, such as smFISH and scRNA-seq. The team of mentors, having highly complementary expertise, will provide an integrative, multidisciplinary training experience."
"9559400","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of the project is to prevent young drivers from using their mobile phones (e.g., texting) while driving. An improved technological intervention and a new distribution model for that intervention are proposed. In 2009, more than 5,400 people died in crashes that were reported to involve a distracted driver and about 448,000 people were injured. Among those killed or injured in these crashes, nearly 1,000 deaths and 24,000 injuries included cellphone use as the major distraction. The CDC reports in a 2012 national survey that 52% of U.S. drivers ages 18-29 reported texting or e-mailing while driving at least once in the last 30 days, and more than a quarter report texting or e-mailing ?regularly? or ?fairly often? while driving. The proportion of drivers reportedly distracted at the time of a fatal crash has increased from 7 percent in 2005 to 11 percent in 2009. Many states are enacting laws to curb texting and cellphone use while driving; however the continued prevalence of this activity even where it is illegal illustrates the need for a technological solution. Technological solutions, in the form of hardware or software that block texting (interlocks) exist, but are not widely utilized. Hardware technologies require vehicle modifications, which limits their appeal. Almost all software technologies rely on GPS to provide vehicle velocity information as an interlock criterion. Texting is disabled when the phone is moving at more than 10 MPH for example. Unfortunately, this sensing modality cannot distinguish whether or not the smartphone is being used by a driver or passenger and therefore disables texting for all passengers in any vehicle under travel including public buses, school buses, trains, passengers in a car, etc. We propose a novel software solution that distinguishes drivers from non-drivers and a new technology distribution strategy that will more effectively engage parents."
"9418517","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Population-specific differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care are termed health disparities and they are a significant concern in our society. Lack of representation of the underserved groups-which includes minorities, financially disadvantaged, and disabled individuals-in the biomedical research and healthcare workforce has been identified as a critical factor underlying health disparities. Indeed, disparities in the demographics of individuals entering careers in biomedical research are well documented. Biomedical knowledge and healthcare will undoubtedly benefit from broader inclusion of underrepresented individuals engaged in biomedical research as inclusive research teams have broader perspectives in setting research agendas, can more effectively recruit diverse subjects into clinical research studies, and work more effectively to deliver health care and reduce health disparities. Experiential learning by active engagement in research is an effective way to nurture the next generation of scientists and health care professionals. Thus, this proposal is designed to recruit and comprehensively immerse college students from underrepresented groups in summer research experiences on the campus of Michigan State University. These research experiences will be focused on three major areas: hypertension, airway disease and blood cells and components in tissue pathology. The objective of the proposed education research program is to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who pursue biomedical research-related educational goals and career paths relevant to the mission areas of the NHLBI. The strategy we propose to meet this objective involves 1) providing program participants an immersive research experience for the purpose of exposing them to the various aspects of a research career, 2) facilitating the development of networks of mentors and peers for the purpose of creating a community that is supportive of the participants' research-related interests, and 3) fostering the participants' successes so as to give them the confidence needed to pursue a research-related career. Implementation of these strategies will accomplish the specific aims (SA) to: (SA1) expose college students to high quality research in the areas of heart, lung and blood diseases; (SA2) provide comprehensive exposure to the various aspects of biomedical research through an organized program of activities; (SA3) bolster the trainees' understanding of the critical concepts of responsible conduct of research; (SA4) recruit trainees from underrepresented backgrounds into these research experiences; and (SA5) determine the effectiveness of our programming in enhancing diversity in health-related biomedical research.

"9441646","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an increasingly urgent public health concern on both the national and global levels. Not only is the disorder a major cause of mortality, but the dyspnea, reduced capacity for physical exertion, and periodic exacerbations that it causes result in tremendous disability and cost. Treatment options for established COPD remain limited in number, diversity, and effectiveness. However, in recent years, significant innovation has been accomplished in the field of lung volume reduction (LVR), which seeks to enhance global lung function through the removal, occlusion, or obliteration of hyperinflated, emphysematous regions. While LVR has traditionally been implemented through surgical resection, the development of less invasive bronchoscopic techniques (BLVR) is ongoing and represents an extremely promising arena of COPD therapy. This application proposes to develop a hyperpolarized 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (HP 129Xe MRI) approach for planning BLVR intervention and assessing its pulmonary effects. The core problem faced by all LVR approaches is that they have demonstrated highly variable outcomes; it consequently remains unclear exactly what types of patient will benefit most from this therapy and why. Clinicians currently base their decisions of whether to carry out LVR and which regions to target using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to measure the extent of emphysema and its distribution. While HRCT is highly capable of accurately assessing these features, it does not provide the functional information necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of an individual patient's regional pulmonary status. We thus posit that the incorporation of functional parameters obtained with HP 129Xe MRI will allow for more informed decision-making in regards to which patients should undergo LVR and how the procedure should be tailored according to the lung health of the particular patient. In applying HP 129Xe MRI to this medical area of need, a corollary goal will be achieved: the refinement of this hyperpolarized technique such that it can extract pulmonary information with the sensitivity of the more well-established HP 3He MRI approach. 3He has become drastically more expensive in recent years due to its scarcity, and the hyperpolarized community recognizes that a shift to the much less expensive and more easily obtainable 129Xe is necessary to ensure the translational applicability of this important technology. We seek here to use Xe to derive three lung parameters-specific ventilation (SV), alveolar oxygen tension (pAO2), 129 and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-with approximately the same sensitivity and efficiency that we have previously attained using 3He. This development will enhance the clinical future of hyperpolarized MRI not only in the area of LVR, but also in the non-invasive assessment of COPD and lung diseases more broadly."
"9608127","Novel genomic mechanism for ligand-dependent transcription by androgen receptor Project Summary/Abstract Androgen receptor (AR) is a member of nuclear hormone receptor (NR) superfamily that binds to cognate hormone responsive elements (HREs) and regulates target gene expression in an endogenous ligand (agonist)-inducible manner in diverse tissues. As AR plays a key role in the onset and progression of prostate cancer, numerous synthetic AR antagonists have been developed to inhibit the action of endogenous AR ligands. A prominent example is enzalutamide (Xtandi), a second-generation AR antagonist showing strong anti-cancer activity for prostate cancer. However, intrinsic or acquired resistance to enzalutamide, and all available AR antagonists, occurs leading to treatment failure. Thus, therapeutic efficacy of current AR antagonists needs to be improved. Elucidation of genomic mechanisms underlying antagonist-liganded AR function is critically important in order to improve AR-targeted therapy. In preliminary studies, we have defined the first high-resolution (motif-resolution) agonist- and antagonist-liganded AR cistromes in prostate cancer cells by using a novel chromatin immunoprecipitation-exonuclease (ChIP-exo) approach. Unexpectedly, we found that AR bound to natural agonist (dihydrotestosterone, DHT) and antagonist (enzalutamide) recognizes distinctly different DNA motifs on chromatin (termed ?DNA motif switching?). Surprisingly, integrated ChIP-exo and RNA-seq analysis found that enzalutamide-liganded AR, bound to a novel AR binding motif, significantly affects global, cancer-relevant transcription. By combining our novel ChIP-exo genomic approach with other epigenomic, proteomic and biochemical approaches, we further found that enzalutamide-liganded AR interacts with specific collaborating transcription factors (e.g. FoxA1) and non-DNA binding coregulators (e.g. Hsp90) on specific active cis-regulatory regions. Importantly, pharmacological Hsp90 inhibition significantly decreases expression of enzalutamide-liganded AR target genes (e.g. cancer promoting genes GR and CD55) and enhances cell growth inhibitory effect of enzalutamide. Based on these compelling data, we hypothesize that DNA motif switching is a novel genomic mechanism underlying antagonist-dependent, cancer-relevant transcription by antagonist-liganded AR transcription complex. Our specific aims are to: 1) determine whether specific transcription factors and epigenetic features globally facilitate AR DNA motif switching; and 2) investigate how antagonist-liganded AR binding regulates expression of cancer-relevant genes. By significantly enhancing our understanding of how antagonist-regulated transcription by AR is controlled at the genomic level, this study will lay the foundation for future development of improved AR-targeted therapy."
"9541020","Macrophages (M?s) play a key role in tumorigenesis; they are a major player in the inflammatory response and produce a host of growth factors as well as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that contribute to cellular transformation, promotion, apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. While it is well established that M?s are primary contributors to protumoral processes, there has been little mechanistic investigation of their specific role in colorectal cancer (CRC). Emerging evidence links gut microbiota to the development and progression of CRC. The tumor-promoting effects of the microbiota in CRC are caused, at least in part, by altered host-microbial interactions. Host-derived immune and inflammatory responses are important driving forces that shape microbial community composition. Recent research identifies the microbiota as a target of inflammation. In fact, inflammation has been reported to favor cancer-promoting biota that may promote cancer progression. M?s are primary mediators of inflammatory processes; however, their influence on cancer promoting-biota has not yet been investigated. The long-term goal is to uncover the mechanisms linking M?s to CRC. The objective of this F31 is to determine the interaction between M?s and gut microbiota in CRC. My central hypothesis is that changes in gut microbiota are driven by M?-mediated inflammatory processes and lead to enhanced progression of CRC. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the role of M?s in inflammation, the gut microbiota profile, and colon tumorigenesis; and 2) Determine whether M?s can influence gut microbiota to promote CRC. In aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that M?s play a role in CRC and that this is associated with inflammation and an altered gut microbiota profile. I will examine the association between macrophages, inflammation, gut microbiota and CRC. Further, I will deplete macrophages at various stages of CRC to determine their role in colon tissue inflammation, the gut microbiota profile and tumorigenesis. Finally, I will use adoptive transfer techniques to test the role of M? phenotype in colon tissue inflammation, gut microbiota, and colon tumorigenesis. In the second aim, I will test the hypothesis that M?-induced changes in the gut microbiota profile can promote CRC. I will transfer gut microbes from M? depleted mice (or intact mice) to antibiotic treated M? intact mice to specifically test the influence of a M?-induced alteration of gut microbiota on metabolites, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and CRC progression. Secondly, using antibiotics I will deplete gut microflora from mice that will receive M?s (or vehicle) to further confirm the role of M?-induced alterations in gut microbiota on CRC. The proposed investigation is significant as it will uncover a mechanism that promotes CRC. Specifically, I will gain an understanding of the role of M?s in the regulation of gut microbiota in CRC. This will allow for the development of approaches that will identify individuals at risk for CRC (i.e. analysis of fecal samples) and then to mitigate that risk with approaches to restore a more healthy microbial profile in the gut."
"9554054","The central goal of the Transgenic and Knockout (TKO) Core at the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center is to generate genetically modified mice for MCCC investigators investigating the normal and malignant functions of genes implicated in human cancers. Dr. Jan van Deursen, who has 25 years of experience in generating transgenic and gene-targeted mouse strains, directs the TKO Core. Two experienced technicians. Dr. Wei Zhou and Ms. Ming Li, execute projects on a first-come-first-serve basis. In practicality this means that most projects are initiated within one to two weeks after a request for service. Our main services include: pronuclear microinjection of DNA into fertilized eggs for the production of transgenic mice, transfection of DNA into ES cells for the generation of gene-targeted ES cells or other types of recombinant ES cell clones, injection of ES cell clones into blastocysts for the generation of chimeric mice, sperm cryopreservation, and recovery of cryopreserved mouse strains. These services are all-inclusive allowing investigators with little or no experience in generating transgenics or knockouts to implement genetically altered mice into their research projects. Success rates of all our services are high, with nearly all transgenic projects generating at least 2-3 independent founders and 85-90% of projects involving gene-targeted ES cells or other types of recombinant ES cell clones yielding the desired mutant strains. Service fees of the TKO Core are lower than external users fees for similar services at academic institutions in the US, and much lower than fees of for profit companies. The user base of the TKO Core, which has traditionally been very broad, has expanded dramatically over the current funding period, with 34 MCCC members from eight different programs using the TKO Core. The broadening of the user base is due to implementation of popular new services such as strain cryopreservation and rederivation. 32 of the 34 MCCC members using the TKO Core are extramurally funded. Importantly, a high proportion of successful extramural applications by MCCC members included genetically modified animals generated by the TKO Core."
"9541889","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States with a very conservative estimate of 1.7 million people affected annually and no less than 5 million people currently suffer from TBI sequelae. After the initial trauma in the central nervous system (CNS), secondary injury (e.g. hypoxia, inflammation, etc.) mediates tissue damage and the deposition of extra-cellular matrix (ECM) molecules leaves scars that inhibit normal tissue repair and full functional recovery. ECM deposition in acute CNS injury consists of the extensively studied glial scar and the relatively newly recognised CNS fibrotic scar. The mechanisms of these events following TBI are poorly understood and the CDC and NIH have encouraged researchers to elucidate them. Previous works in micro-RNAs (miRNAs) has shown that downregulation of miR29b and upregulation of miR21 are vital for ECM deposition after injury and give us a novel way of investigating potential interventions to change outcomes after TBI. We propose to manipulate these miRNA levels to not only clarify the mechanism of fibrotic and gliotic changes after TBI but also to potentially improve recovery after injury by attenuating ECM deposition. Furthermore, YAP, a co-transcription factor and member of the Hippo signalling pathway, has been recently found to contribute to fibrosis in the liver and kidneys and is an important modulator of miRNA levels. Therefore, in this proposal, we will study miR29b, miR21 and YAP in tandem. We have shown that miR29b decreases and miR21 increases simultaneously after TBI and that this correlates with fibrosis and gliosis in the lesion area. This proposal will test the hypothesis that increasing miR29b and decreasing miR21 levels will improve TBI recovery from decreased ECM deposition. In the first specific aim, we will investigate our preliminary findings that miR29b and miR21 will decrease and increase, respectively, after TBI, and that these levels correlate with their target genes (specifically ones involved in ECM deposition such as chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans, collagen1a1, etc.) in neurons, astrocytes, microglia and perivascular fibroblasts. As miR29b decreases due to TGF? and other inflammatory cytokines suppressing its transcription, miR29b derepresses its pro-fibrotic target genes and promotes fibrosis. As miR21 increases after injury, its targets (PTEN, PPAR?, Smad7, etc.) will decrease and that has been shown to also promote fibrosis (and gliosis after spinal cord injury). In the second aim, we will investigate the causal link among miRNAs, YAP and their gliotic and fibrotic specific target genes in two prototypical cell types for ECM deposition in the CNS: astrocytes and fibroblasts. We will validate our viral method for manipulating the miRNA levels, downstream mRNA and protein levels of the pro- fibrotic and gliotic miRNA target genes. This will lead to our third and final aim to see if manipulating the miRNA levels (with or without YAP changes) will improve the anatomic and behavioural recovery following TBI via attenuated gliosis, fibrosis and ECM deposition. These proposed studies will help define the contributions of miR29b and miR21 in fibrosis and gliosis in TBI and, potentially give new venues to pursue clinical therapeutics."
"9521018","Abstract Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery results in protracted quadriceps weakness that is associated with poorer outcomes, altered biomechanics and heightened risk of subsequent injuries. Little progress has been made in improving quadriceps strength and functional outcomes in the past decade. Alterations in the cellular and morphological composition of the knee extensor muscles contribute to weakness following an ACL reconstruction. ACL reconstruction induces expression of myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth, locally within the quadriceps. In addition to mitigating muscle regrowth, myostatin also promotes connective tissue synthesis through activation of figrogenic cells within muscle. The objective of this proposal is to determine the time course of deleterious changes to the injured ligament and limb muscle and identify myostatin as integral in the etiology of protracted muscle weakness in individuals following an ACL tear. Aim 1 will evaluate the timeframe of myostatin induction within the injured ACL and quadriceps. Aim 2 will determine the deleterious changes within the muscle using a mouse model of ACL injury and the efficacy of follistatin and a soluble form of the myostatin receptor (activin 2B receptor) to mitigate these maladaptations. Experiments in aim 3 will determine if the competitive inhibition of myostatin is capable of rescuing ACL injury- induced skeletal muscle weakness. Finally, aim 4 will define if the acute induction of myostatin signaling following an ACL injury in human subjects predicts reductions in muscle strength, connective tissue infiltration and dysregulation of skeletal muscle progenitor cells. The identification of myostatin as a therapeutic target will establish the basis for further research to mitigate myostatin signaling after ACL and other ligamentous injuries to improve rehabilitative efforts and patient recovery."
"9673647","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excessive worker injury rates continue in agriculture. Adult and senior farmers in the Southern U.S. region experience the highest occurrence of agricultural occupational injury and mortality in the nation. In this community-based, translationa intervention effectiveness research study, we will work with established farm community organizations in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, to develop and test a novel intervention: didactic reader's theater, with 450 adult and senior farmers, and their family members, to positively change farm work culture and safety behavior. A comparison group (n=450) will allow rigorous analysis of the effect of the intervention. In the final year we will pilot test the intervention's effect with younger farmers (n=80), plus a comparison group, (n=80). Together with the farm organizations, we will establish mechanisms to sustain the intervention in farm communities. We expect, given our pilot data, that this intervention will have a substantial impact on decreasing injury risk in the target states and other southern states, with generalizability to multiple rural areas in the United States. This proposal addresses HP 2020 Occupational Safety and Health through the NORA Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing (AgFF) Sector Council's Strategic Goal #2 - Vulnerable workers (subset older farmers), Action step 2.43: Facilitate the development and evaluation of high quality and appropriate materials where gaps exist; Goal #3: Move proven health and safety strategies into agricultural, forestry and fishing workplaces through the development of partnerships and collaborative efforts; Goal #4: Reduce the number, rate, and severity of traumatic injuries and deaths involving hazards of production agriculture and support activities, and Goal #5: Improve the health and well-being of agricultural workers by reducing occupational causes or contributing factors to acute and chronic illness and disease. It also addresses the cross sectors of work organization, health disparities, traumatic injury, and stress-related disorders. The specific aims are to: 1. Develop and deliver, in cooperation with the farm community, a translational intervention, didactic readers  theater, to reduce injury and enhance the health of adult and senior farmers, and their families; 2. Test the efficacy of the agricultural health/safety didactic readers theater in changig farm work behavior of  adult and senior farmers and their families; 3. Strengthen the local capacity of agricultural communities and organizations to develop and deliver effective  health and safety interventions through theater and other approaches, over time (sustainability)."
"9541755","PROJECT SUMMARY A fundamental cellular process critical for normal neurodevelopment and neuronal function is clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Within the CNS, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is functionally coupled to the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles for neurotransmission and essential for vesicular receptor desensitization. While cholesterol depletion is known to dramatically inhibit clathrin-mediated signaling, the specific mechanisms and requirements underlying membrane dynamics and clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways are unknown. Interestingly, autosomal recessive disorders of cholesterol synthesis, characterized by substitution of cellular cholesterol for sterol intermediates, constitute a group of malformation syndromes that severely affect nervous system development and function. Our preliminary data demonstrates clathrin-mediated endocytosis exhibits a high degree of lipid specificity to function normally. Delineating the neurological consequences of altered sterol homeostasis on clathrin activity will provide novel mechanistic data regarding vesicular trafficking in the context of neurodevelopment and neuronal function. Our long-term objective for this proposal is to delineate the cellular consequences of sterol substitution on vesicular trafficking and neuronal function. Aim 1 will utilize live- cell imaging of CRISPR-Cas9-edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to define the impact of altered sterol homeostasis on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Endogenous clathrin dynamics will be monitored in real-time and quantified by live cell confocal imaging, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Aim 2 will determine the molecular mechanism by which cholesterol synthesis inhibition disrupts clathrin-mediated endocytic events through atomic force microscopy and polarized total internal reflection fluorescence (polTIRF) microscopy to dynamically monitor cell stiffness, membrane bending and clathrin assembly. Aim 3 will define the functional effects of sterol substitution on vesicular trafficking and clathrin-mediated endocytosis within the neural synapse using patch- clamp electrophysiology and high-resolution microscopic analysis of differentiated patient-derived iPSCs. These studies will directly contribute to the understanding of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and functional implications of disruption of this process by sterol precursors on vesicular trafficking at the mammalian synapse. This work will provide critical evidence for disrupted clathrin-mediated trafficking underlying the neurological deficits observed in cholesterol synthesis disorders and may support a role for dysfunction of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in more common neurological conditions associated with altered cholesterol levels, such as schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease."
"9623977","Since its inception in 2008, the Utah CCTS KL2 Program rationale has been to distinguish itself by providing promising junior faculty researchers with multidimensional mentored research experiences that enable them to develop, demonstrate, and disseminate translational science to advance health. The program draws scholars from the large pool of candidates in the seven Utah CCTS partnering institutions and provides a path to research success. The end result is the creation of a diverse team of scientists who impact local and national healthcare priorities from birth to end of life. Program impact is demonstrated by research productivity where 67% of past scholars have received additional career development awards and collectively have published 317 manuscripts with 7,094 citations (average H-index = 9.8). The objective of the Utah KL2 program for the next five years is to have promising junior faculty members achieve research success. While the typical determinant of research success is attainment of R01 level NIH support, we broaden the definition of K to Research success to include leading a scientific research enterprise of >$200,000 in annual support and conducting research with substantial impact on health and healthcare. We will realize this objective with the following three aims:  Aim 1: Improve the proportion of KL2 scholars who achieve ?K to R equivalent Success?, including increasing the proportion (from 17% to 50%) who are the PI on an R01 equivalent award within 5 years of completing their mentored training award.  Aim 2 Increase the number of Utah CCTS KL2 Scholars who are underrepresented in medicine (URM).  Aim 3: Proactively strengthen and expand use of existing clinical and translational science career  development opportunities within the Utah CCTS ecosystem and the national CTSA network. Key program design features include the University?s Vice President?s Clinical and Translational science (VPCAT) program. This two year intensive experience provides the curricular and mentoring foundation for KL2 scholars by using the holistic Matrix Mentoring Model, development of an Individual Development Plans (IDP), and training in Management Essentials for Principal Investigators. We will build on these features to accomplish our stated aims by 1) creating an institutional infrastructure specifically designed to support new investigators in pursuit of R01s, 2) implementing targeted recruitment of those underrepresented in medicine beginning at the pre-doctoral level, and 3) expand use of Utah CCTS community outreach resources and augment links with other CTSA programs. The Utah KL2 directors, Steering Committee, and established External Advisory Board will provide guidance for the program as it expands from two to four NCATS supported scholars, with a focus on increasing the diversity of the group. In addition, we will also add the option for a third year of support for scholars for whom the additional funding would be transformative."
"9634332","Project Summary Gay and bisexual men (GBM) in the U.S. are burdened by a high and disproportionate rate of HIV infection and more than half of all HIV+ individuals are GBM. Improving viral load (VL) suppression is associated with a significant reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV. Moreover, research is needed to better understand the modifiable social and behavioral factors that influence their long-term health. Chronic experiences of sexual minority stressors (e.g., internalized homonegativity) have been shown to influence a variety of mental, behavioral, and physical health outcomes for GBM, including general stress (e.g., cortisol) and immune (e.g., cytokines) outcomes, as well as HIV-specific health outcomes (e.g., CD4 count) among HIV+ GBM. Chronic experiences of HIV-related stressors have also been shown to impact mental health and health behaviors for HIV+ GBM, though there is substantially less research on their role in the health of HIV+ GBM. Previous research, including our own, has shown that fluctuations in sexual minority and HIV-specific stressors (i.e., acute experiences of these stressors) are measurable and meaningfully associated with health outcomes. Both HIV infection and substance use are associated with declines in neurocognitive function and emerging evidence suggests that emotional processing may help explain the impact of psychological phenomena on health outcomes. To develop interventions that are robust and durable, research is needed that examines the unique and overlapping influence of sexual minority and HIV-related stressors on health outcomes for HIV+ GBM within a unified biopsychosocial model. Such a model should take into account both individual-level (i.e., chronic) and situational (i.e., acute) experiences of these stressors to examine their independent associations with health, and should consider whether emotional interference in cognitive processing might moderate these associations. Aim 1 of the study is to test a biopsychosocial model of sexual minority and HIV-related stress and health, examining direct and indirect effects of these stressors on each outcome. Aim 2 is to test the moderating role of emotional interference in cognitive processing on these associations. Finally, Aim 3 is to examine the extent of intraindividual variability over one year in sexual minority and HIV-related stressors, VL, CD4, and cytokines. Although not an aim, the study will culminate in the development of guidelines for future intervention development and we will gather participant feedback on these recommendations. To accomplish these aims, we will enroll 250 HIV+ GBM and follow them for 12 months. We will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 21 days and quarterly longitudinal follow-ups over one year to test the impact of sexual minority and HIV-related stress on physiological stress (diurnal cortisol) and long-term immune outcomes (VL suppression, CD4 count, cytokines). This study will address novel questions about the relative role of sexual minority and HIV-related stress in the health of HIV+ GBM to guide the development of interventions to improve health and reduce HIV transmission, morbidity, and mortality among HIV+ GBM."
"9660386","7. Project Summary: The proposal describes a five-year plan for training Dr. Li Ye to achieve his goal to become an independent investigator in the central regulation of metabolism. The training and career development plan includes a compelling research project, training in laboratory techniques and didactic scientific and career development seminars and courses. The applicant has more than a decade of experiences working in both molecular metabolism and systems neurosciences. During his Ph.D., Dr. Ye was trained with Dr. Bruce Spiegelman, a well-recognized leader in the field of obesity and diabetes. His previous findings in metabolic research have been published in many high-impact journals and have been then cited near 4,000 times in the subsequent works of his peers. During the proposed training, Dr. Karl Deisseroth, a leading expert in neurosciences will mentor the applicant?s scientific and career development. Dr. Deisseroth has trained numerous prominent scientists who now hold faculty positions in academic institutions. In addition, an advisory committee with highly regarded expertise in hypothalamic and feeding research (Dr. Luis de Lecea and Dr. Brad Lowell) will provide the applicant scientific advice and career guidance. The overall goal of the project is to study neural mechanisms responsible for coordinating food intake and metabolic demands. The obesity epidemic is putting an enormous burden on the public health systems, by contributing to the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Obesity is a result of energy imbalance, in which energy consumption chronically exceeds the expenditure. There are two types of feeding, one driven by metabolic need and the other by the hedonic aspect of palatable food. The former is mainly regulated by the hypothalamic and hindbrain structures that are responsive to peripheral hormonal signals such as leptin, insulin, and ghrelin. The latter is predominantly controlled by the reward systems including the mesolimbic pathway and dopamine signaling. Preliminary studies suggested these systems converge in the lateral hypothalamus area (LH). Dissecting the circuit, cellular and molecular bases separating these two systems in the LH is key to understanding the central control of energy balance and its dysfunction during obesity, however, differentiating intermingled neural ensembles within a brain region has been difficult. In his early postdoctoral work, the candidate has developed a series of CLARITY and optogenetics-based technologies with sufficient throughput to map brain-wide connectivity as well as with the ability to retain molecular information at the single cell level to distinguish intermingled neuronal populations. Using these tools, the candidate has successfully dissected two anatomically intermingled but functionally distinct ensembles representing opposite valences in the medial prefrontal cortex. These recent advances in systems neuroscience provide us a unique opportunity to dissect and differentiate the LH ensembles recruited by hedonic vs. metabolic feeding. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that hedonic and metabolic feeding recruit distinct ensembles in the LH. Specifically, these two ensembles quantitatively differ in: (1) the inputs they receive from upstream brain regions, (2) neuronal activity during different types of feeding, and (3) causal impact on feeding behaviors. Moreover, the adaptation of these ensembles to chronic high-fat diet is key to the development of hyperphagia. The general approach will be to use systems neuroscience tools to monitor and manipulate neuronal activity in behaving animals (Aim1 and Aim2). The molecular and structural adaption will be measured using ribosome-profiling and high-throughput imaging approaches (Aim3). Together, the proposal study will elucidate neural mechanisms underlying the HFD-induced hyperphagia; in the meantime, provide the candidate with the essential training to start an independent research program focusing on the central regulation of energy homeostasis. The Deisseroth laboratory and Stanford School of Medicine research community provide an ideal setting for training future independent investigators. This project will also bring together leading laboratories of the advisory committee that complement each other?s expertise. These outstanding resources will maximize the potential for the applicant to successfully transition to an independent investigator."

"9623458","Contact PD/PI: Winokur, Patricia ABSTRACT The Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at the University of Iowa (UI) was established by the Board of Regents to realize three objectives ? first, to lead the development of translational science at the UI; second, to advance translational science as a distinct academic discipline; and third, to disseminate capacities in translational science across the State of Iowa. This mandate enabled us to tackle large problems affecting translational science that required institutional solutions, such as transforming regulatory processes for human subjects research, developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and other health care data, establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations, and revitalizing the pipeline of well trained clinical and translational researchers. Iowa is a rural state, which brings special health care needs and challenges. We have used these rural considerations as a catalyst for driving our approach to clinical and translational research pushing our teams to develop strategies to engage rural populations of all ages and backgrounds and to create new approaches that overcome the geographic barriers in a rural state. We are capitalizing on our established community practice networks of family physicians, clinics, school nurses and pharmacists. We utilize e Health/ e Learning platforms in novel ways and will test the efficacy of these new methods of engagement. As we move research ?Beyond Our Borders,? we have created methods to capture real-time, real-life data from the home and to correlate this environmentally specific, comprehensive data to human performance. The ICTS is engaging with other CTSA hubs and national CTR systems to empirically test different approaches and to develop the evidence base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. Though distance and rurality drive our approaches, the strategies that we develop are simply new and potentially better ways to generate broad representation and improved participation by patients, healthcare teams and academicians. Through our local, state and national partnerships, UI and the ICTS are poised to move clinical and translational discovery rapidly into healthcare practice in a variety of clinical settings.

"9618350","Abstract The AIDS pandemic remains a significant global problem with over 33.3 million persons currently infected with HIV and HIV-related illnesses claiming the lives of over 1.8 million individuals annually. Various studies have suggested a link between abuse of illicit drugs, including cocaine and increased risk of HIV transmission, accelerated HIV disease progression, and AIDS-related mortality. Women represent the fastest growing population of new HIV cases. It is estimated that more than 80% of HIV cases result from sexual transmission and semen is the primary vector. However, only about 0.1% of acts of heterosexual coitus with an infected individual result in HIV infection, suggesting that factors contained in semen may modulate the infectivity or fitness of HIV particles in semen. The underlying mechanisms of HIV transmission are not well understood. In spite of the progress in studies of HIV pathogenesis and the ability of various agents to suppress virus infection, methods to prevent HIV transmission still require more investigation. Recently, we showed that semen of healthy donors contain heterologous populations of exosomes that are morphologically distinct with respect to size and electron density. These exosomes contain different species of RNA (mRNA and small RNA), and inhibit infection with HIV. Our preliminary data reveal that similar to exosomes from the semen of healthy donors, exosomes purified from HIV infected donors potently block HIV infection while exosomes from HIV infected donors who use cocaine do not inhibit HIV. Our preliminary study further showed that HIV infection and cocaine use modulates RNA composition of semen exosomes. Importantly, lysed semen exosomes from both HIV negative and HIV infected donors but not donors who used cocaine inhibit reverse transcription of lysed HIV in a cell-free system, block the synthesis of HIV U5 DNA, and reverse transcription of U5 to Gag. These data indicate direct effect of semen exosomes on HIV reverse transcription. In this application, studies are designed to 1) determine the effect of HIV infection and cocaine abuse on the anti-HIV activity of semen exosomes, 2) determine the mechanisms of anti-HIV effect of semen exosomes, and 3) characterize the effects of donor HIV status and cocaine use on semen exosome composition. As sexual transmission is the main route for the spread of HIV and semen is the primary vector, the studies proposed in this application will address a new challenge for evaluation of the efficacy of semen exosomes as a protective factor against HIV and how donor HIV status and cocaine use modulate this function."
"9459395","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypothesis: Our previous studies using elastase-perfusion models of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have shown that IL-1R1 KO mice have a decreased incidence and size of aneurysm formation. We have also recently shown that treatment with the IL-1 pathway inhibitor, anakinra, in both prevention and treatment studies results in significant protection from aneurysm formation in a mouse model of AAA. In the current proposal, we will investigate the role of IL-1 signaling in smooth muscle and macrophage phenotypic transitions using novel rigorous lineage tracing mouse models of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation and to examine the mechanism of IL-1R1 signaling in AAA formation as a method to selectively determine treatment strategies to protect against AAA formation. Methods: We will use a elastase perfusion and Angiotensin II murine models of AAA coupled with rigorous smooth muscle and macrophage lineage tracing analysis in conditional IL-1 receptor 1 KO mice. Anakinra treatment will be administered via osmotic pump to determine the role of Anakinra treatment on smooth muscle cell and macrophage transitions during aneurysm formation. Aortic diameter will be measured on day 3, 7, 14, and 28. Aortic tissue will be harvested to analyze pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1?, TNF-?, MCP-1, IL-6, and RANTES), MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity by zymography, serine proteases (uPA, tPA and PAI-1) by western blots, elastin and collagen degradation as well as aortic smooth muscle expression by histology, and immune cell (macrophages, T cells, neutrophils, B cells) infiltration by flow cytometry. Results: Preliminary data found significant attenuation in aneurysm formation in IL-1R1 KO mice 14 days following elastase perfusion in AAA formation. Wild-type male mice administered anakinra via osmotic pump 3 days before TAA formation also exhibited decreased aortic diameter. AAA formation in IL1? and IL1R1 KO male mice display a decreased aortic diameter, decreased cytokine production (TNF?, MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-27), decreased MMP-9 expression and decreased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration compared to wild-type male mice. Finally, IL-1R1 is increased in human AAA samples versus non-aneurysmal controls via qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: IL-1 pathway inhibition can attenuate aneurysm formation and inflammation in the topical elastase murine model of AAA. We propose to delineate the mechanism of IL-1 signaling in AAA formation using novel lineage tracing analysis in smooth muscle cell and macrophages and to examine the role of IL-1 signaling in the pathology of aneurysm formation with the overall goal to develop aneurysm treatment."
"9440372","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    In the past 25 years, little improvement has been made in patient survival after a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The robust induction of angiogenesis, extreme resistance to radiation, and a highly aggressive, invasive phenotype make GBM one of the most lethal and difficult human cancers to treat. Recently, a mesenchymal subtype of GBMs has been identified that displays the most infiltrative behavior, is the most resistant to standard therapies, and expresses markers, such as a secreted protein YKL-40, which correlate with the worst patient prognosis. We have identified that two proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1? (IL-1?) and oncostatin M (OSM), are specifically overexpressed in patients with mesenchymal GBM. Our data indicates that IL-1? and OSM synergize to support GBM progression through a novel RelB/p50-canonical pathway, which to date has only been proposed to function in cells expressing high levels of RelB. Our preliminary studies have identified two groups of RelB/p50-dependent genes in GBM cells and astrocytes: conserved genes (activated in both GBM and astrocytes) and aberrantly-activated genes (activated in GBM but suppressed in astrocytes). The conserved genes include markers of the mesenchymal GBM subtype and intriguing novel genes postulated to regulate GBM progression. The aberrantly activated genes encode many cytokines, including IL-1, which suggests the existence of RelB-driven feedforward cytokine loop fueling chronic inflammation in GBM. Importantly, the aberrantly-activated genes have previously been shown to undergo RelB-dependent reprograming by epigenetic silencing in macrophages, which requires histone deacetylase SIRT1. Our preliminary studies have found that one allele of the sirt1 gene is deleted in 75% of GBM tumors, which may explain the lack of RelB-dependent epigenetic silencing in GBM. Thus, we hypothesize that RelB/p50 activation drives gene expression programs which induced both chronic inflammation and GBM aggressiveness."
"9415991","Approximately 37.5 million Americans have some problem hearing, and hearing-related problems rank as the most common service-connected disabilities. One of the chief complaints of those with hearing impairment is difficulty communicating in background noise, a challenge that is exacerbated by several health conditions that are prominent within the Veteran population (e.g., traumatic brain injury, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease). In addition, many older individuals have difficulties understanding speech in background noise beyond what would be expected based solely on their audiometric thresholds. There is a fundamental need for improved diagnosis and treatment of speech understanding in noise difficulties. This research program sets out to establish electrophysiological correlates of speech-in-noise understanding with the goal of supplementing speech-in-noise testing. The assumption is that accurate perception in noise is dependent, in part, on the accuracy of neural coding of the auditory stimulus. By combining electrophysiological and behavioral information we can advance our understanding of perception-in-noise difficulties and predict outcomes in difficult-to-test individuals using physiological testing.  The clinical significance of the research proposed is related directly to the ability to predict, more accurately diagnose, and more precisely treat perception-in-noise difficulties. An electrophysiological measure that predicts speech perception will allow for improved assessment of difficult-to-test populations and provide information about the capacity of that auditory system to encode certain stimuli. This will allow the clinician to tailor treatment strategies to the specific needs of the individual and to counsel patients more effectively in terms of the expectations they should have and the benefit they should expect as a result of specific treatments. Therefore, to further our understanding of signal-in-noise perception and neural coding, we will use brainstem, cortical, and cognitive auditory evoked potentials and behavioral speech understanding-in-noise measures with age and hearing impairment as continuous variables to characterize the effect sizes of various covariates and to improve our understanding of the relationship between brain and behavioral measures."
"9405818","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Objective: A major objective of this proposal is to train Dr. Sowers to become an independent translational neuroscientist in the VA system. To accomplish this, he has prepared a research plan that will allow training in state-of-the-art optogenetic techniques to address a major issue facing Veterans, post-traumatic headache. Veterans returning from active duty are at an increased risk for post-traumatic headache that includes migraine. U.S. military personnel screened within 90 days of returning from a one-year combat tour in Iraq had 2-4 times the rate of migraine compared to civilians. One debilitating aspect of post traumatic headache is concurrent photophobia which can negatively affect Veterans daily lives. Interventions and treatments for post- traumatic headache and photophobia remain inadequate due to a poor understanding of the relevant neuroanatomical correlates. This proposal aims to identify brain regions that are directly involved with the development of post-traumatic headache and photosensitivity and test pharmacological agents to mitigate light sensitivity. As a starting point we plan to focus on areas implicated in light aversion and modulated by the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Our findings will overcome two major hindrances in the development of future treatments for Veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) by determining: first, which brain regions are sufficient to induce photophobia, and second, whether these regions are necessary for the development of TBI induced photophobia. The results from these studies will guide future innovative therapeutic interventions, such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial stimulation, for the treatment of this debilitating chronic condition of TBI. This stuy will be aided by clinical interactions with his multidisciplinary mentoring team, two of which are practicing psychiatrists within the VA system, as well as a neuro-ophthalmologist. Dr. Sowers will have access to a large TBI population at the Center for the Treatment and Prevention of Visual Loss. The training plan will also take advantage of interactions with clinicians and basic scientists in the VA Center. Moreover, Dr. Sowers' mentor has ongoing collaborations with two pharmaceutical companies (Alder and Eli Lilly) that will facilitate the translation of the expected  findings to clinical trials. These clinical perspectives will not only aid with the applicant's traning, but will also focus the research plan on a fast translational timeframe. Methods: We have established a pre-clinical blast-induced light-aversion model as an objective indicator of post-traumatic headache. In Aim 1, we will use optogenetic applications to target specific brain regions we hypothesize to be involved with the development of post-traumatic headache. In Aim 2 we will use pharmacological manipulation of CGRP to alleviate post-traumatic headache in C57BL/6J wild type mice. Expected results: This proposal will have three main outcomes: 1) It will establish the applicant as an expert in pre-clinical TBI models that are closely linked to translational testing of novel therapeutics. 2) It will significantly advance our understanding of the neuroanatomy underlying post-traumatic headache and photophobia by identifying brain regions that could be targets for specific deep brain stimulation or transcranial stimulatory treatments. 3) The proposed work will benefit Veterans by identifying future pharmacological treatments to ameliorate post-traumatic headache."
"9674289","PROJECT SUMMARY Effective tick control is an important public health measure for combating Lyme disease. It is generally believed that the majority of Lyme disease cases are acquired from ticks living in the peridomestic landscape, thereby placing responsibility for disease prevention mostly at the local level, and especially on individual householders. Despite several studies documenting effective peridomestic tick control measures, human exposures to ticks are increasingly common and cases of Lyme disease have not been reduced. This project aims to bridge the gap between tick control research and human behavior by 1) assessing the effectiveness of an integrated tick management (ITM) strategy applied to either individual or contiguous residential properties, and 2) identifying patterns of human activity within and outside of the peridomestic landscape that lead to encounters with infected ticks. Our ITM approach will integrate the application of well-timed sprays of tick-killing chemicals (to reduce host-seeking ticks) with installation of rodent-targeted bait boxes (to reduce the prevalence of ticks carrying Lyme- causing germs). This approach will be evaluated simultaneously at properties in Lyme-endemic towns located in western Connecticut and southern Rhode Island. Tick abundance will be compared between treated and untreated properties using standard tick collecting methods. Human tick encounters will be recorded and compared using a novel crowd-sourced reporting system (TickSpotters). Study participants will be asked to document the location of their outdoor activity throughout the day in easy-to-use digital journals. Expected outcomes of this project are a reduction in the number of infected blacklegged ticks and human tick encounters at residences receiving an integrated tick management intervention, and an improved understanding of where people encounter ticks both around human habitations and in public outdoor settings."

A prominent attribute of the CCRO is the extensive integration and standardization among the MCCC campuses to provide collaborative support to MCCC investigators and programs. The integration of the MCCC across the Mayo enterprise (Arizona, Florida, Rochester) has required a unified CCRO, which consists of shared systems, standard operating procedures, structure, support, and the ability to provide cross-coverage in support of MCCC investigators. Future goals of the CCRO include continued efforts to improve the timelines, development, activation, and conduct of clinical trials."
"9393428","The implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) is a priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and other healthcare systems. Supporting EBP implementation is seen as a crucial means by which to ensure that Veterans receive consistently high-quality and appropriate care. Cognitive- behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) is an EBP that is considered central to the interdisciplinary treatment of pain, and consequently VHA has invested substantial resources into system-wide training and certification for CBT-CP. Despite this substantial investment, practically nothing is known regarding the implementation of CBT-CP following initial training and certification, and based on implementation of other EBPs, there is good reason to believe that modification occurs frequently, with unknown impact on quality of Veterans' care. In order to prevent the waste of crucial VA resources and missed opportunities to improve Veterans' chronic pain treatment, an empirical understanding of what modifications are made to CBT-CP, why they are made, and the subsequent effects on implementation (including Veteran pain outcomes), is essential. Our project will include a VHA-Wide survey of CBT-CP providers that will assess common modifications made to CBT-CP in the field (Aim 1). This survey will also be used to identify participants in a prospective observational study of provider motivations to modify CBT-CP (Aim 2) as well as the effects of modification on Veteran outcomes (Aim 3a) and CBT-CP implementation (Aim 3b). Aim 1 will be achieved through a national survey. These data will also be used to target recruitment for Aims 2 and 3. A stratified random sampling of Aim 1 respondents and Veterans receiving their care will be selected for a prospective naturalistic observational study of CBT-CP modifications and their effects. Clinicians will complete semi-structured interviews regarding modification at baseline and follow-up. We will examine the association between change in Veteran outcomes and type and extent of modifications. Implementation will be assessed through the lens of Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM). RE-AIM variables will be assessed via a combination of record review/administrative data, Veteran interviews, and clinician self-report. Analyses of Aim 1 will be descriptive in nature. In order to test the relationship between provider motivation and modification in Aim 2, we will use Pearson's correlations, and interview responses regarding reasons for modification will be analyzed using inductive analyses. Multi-level mixed effects models will be used to examine the relationship between modification and change in Veteran outcomes (Aim 3). Results will provide vital information regarding the impact of current CBT-CP implementation efforts, factors which may affect provider behavior, and help maximize productive modifications associated with positive Veteran outcomes."
"9540590","Abstract/Project Summary: The cell cycle is critical for health and disease. Defects in the cell cycle result in disruptions in morphogenetic behaviors as well as cancer. In order to understand how the cell cycle impinges on morphogenetic and disease processes, I am developing a fluorescence cell cycle state biosensor for use in C. elegans. This cell cycle state biosensor is dynamically localized between the nucleus and cytoplasm over the course of the cell cyle via cyclin dependent kinase activity. Ratiometric measurement of the cytoplasm and nucleus allows for direct quantification of cell cycle state. Additionally, I am developing a software package for automated image analysis of ratiometric data for use in C. elegans. As a test case, I will characterize the cell cycle in the morphogenesis of the C. elegans vulva and uterus. One of the cells in the uterus, the anchor cell, invades through two layers of basement membrane to contact the underlying vulval epithelium, forming the connection between the uterus and the vulva required for ovoposition and initiating vulval morphogenesis. The anchor cell can only invade the basement membrane in G1/G0?a cell cycle state that may be broadly associated with the ability to breach the basement membrane in both cancer metastasis and development. This cell cycle arrest is mediated by both cell cycle components and chromatin modifiers. Using the cell cycle indicator developed by this proposal, I will identify the genetic mechanism by which the G1/G0 pro- invasive cell cycle arrest of the anchor cell is maintained."
"9420467","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bone loss affects millions of patients in the United States annually and can be caused by traumatic injury, inflammatory and infectious diseases, congenital malformation or oncologic resection. Conventional treatment often involves using autologous or allograft bone tissues, which is limited by donor site morbidity, insufficient donor tissue supply, and potential immunogenicity. Stem cell-based therapy offers a promising approach for the repair of bone loss such as cranial and long bone defects. However, a critical barrier to progress in the field is the lack of suitable cell carriers that can support stem cell survival, and guide vascularized and mineralized bone formation in situ without the addition of supraphysiological concentration of growth factors. To address the above challenges, my proposed multidisciplinary approach aims to validate the efficacy of microribbon-based scaffolds as a novel type of cell carrier for enhancing stem cell survival and mineralized bone matrix deposition in vivo using a mouse critical size cranial defect model. Our RB- like hydrogels were fabricated by wet-spinning gelatin (digested collagen), the most abundant ECM matrix protein, into RB-like structures, which can be crosslinked into a macroporous scaffold. The resulting hydrogels combine the injectability and cell-encapsulation ability of standard hydrogels with the macroporosity that facilitates faster vascular ingrowth, cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and ECM deposition. This injectable system empowers minimally invasive surgery for a broad range of diseases. In our preliminary studies, RB-based matrices markedly enhanced the survival of human adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) and accelerated tissue regeneration in vivo. Here I propose to further enhance the osteoinductivity and osteoconductivity of RB-like hydrogels by tuning RB stiffness, bulk stiffness and hydroxyapatite coating. I hypothesize that osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in microribbon-based scaffolds can be enhanced by increasing the RB stiffness and hydroxyapatite coating of microribbons. Furthermore, I hypothesize that increasing bulk stiffness of the scaffold will result  in reduced matrix deposition due to decreasing pore size. Overall, the macroporosity of microribbon-based scaffolds would lead to enhanced cell survival, faster vascularization and enhanced bone tissue formation in vivo compared to convention biomaterials. The outcomes of the proposed work would lead to the development of new tissue engineering therapy for treating craniofacial and other large bony defects, and correspondingly reduce the associated socio-economical burden on society."

"9561307","HIV pathogenesis is characterized by the progressive loss of CD4+ T cells leading to a state of extreme immunodeficiency. Rather than simply due to direct infection and death of target CD4+ T cells, this is now appreciated to be more extensively due to overt and sustained chronic immune activation. Levels of immune activation can vary significantly between individuals, and this represents a major contributor to the differential kinetics of CD4+ T cell decline observed among infected individuals. We have previously identified that the viral replication capacity (vRC) of the transmitted virus is a significant predictor of differential immune activation observed during acute HIV infection (Claiborne et al., PNAS, 2015). Specifically, the vRC of the transmitted virus is positively correlated with the level of inflammatory cytokines and the frequency of activated T cells and is a significant predictor of longitudinal CD4+ T cell decline independent of viral load or protective HLA class I alleles. However, despite extensive data linking vRC to immune activation, and immune activation to CD4+ T cell loss, the precise mediator of this immune activation has not yet been elucidated. This is largely due to limitations in the ability to sample plasma and mucosal tissues during the eclipse phase of the infection in human cohorts, and the confounding effects of baseline immune activation and co-infections on these early events. As such, these studies would benefit from a small animal model of HIV infection that would accurately recapitulate the salient aspects of immune activation and CD4+ T cell loss.  Here, we propose to use the bone marrow-liver-thymus (BLT) humanized mouse model to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying HIV-associated bystander T cell activation and death linked to chronic immune activation. Our preliminary data demonstrates that the BLT mouse model recapitulates vRC-associated differential immune activation and CD4+ T cell loss, in that mice infected with high vRC viruses displayed significantly higher frequencies of CD38+/HLA-DR+ and PD-1+ CD8+ T cells and significantly increased CD4+ T cell decline. Moreover, congruent with human studies, our preliminary data in BLT mice suggests a role for the innate immune system in mediating this acute immune activation. Therefore, we intend to use the BLT mouse model of HIV infection to interrogate the extent to which immune activation and CD4+ T cell loss are driven by interactions between vRC and the innate immune system. To this end, we propose to infect BLT mice with an array of viruses exhibiting significant differences in vRC and to monitor the levels of inflammatory cytokines as well as peripheral and mucosal cellular immune activation. Additionally, we propose to employ RNA-seq analysis to describe gene pathways differentially expressed between BLT mice infected with low and high vRC viruses. In concert, we will evaluate the contributions of the innate immune system by comparing myeloid subset reconstitution levels with inflammatory gene expression. Collectively, this analysis will allow us to identify candidate gene pathways responsible for increased innate immune activation and exacerbated CD4+ T cell loss. Finally, we will use this information to identify novel targets and to test therapeutic interventions designed to blunt early immune activation and the resultant pathogenesis."

During the previous funding period, a new Director was appointed and several enhancements were made to the overall structure, policies, and procedures of the SJCCC. 32,522 clinical trial enrollments occurred at the Center during the current funding period, of which 56% were to SJCCC investigator initiated studies. External peer reviewed trials, many which are SJCCC member-led, accounted for another 38% of enrollments. SJCCC members published more than 2,100 manuscripts during the funding period, and in the last 12 months were supported by $69.4 million in extramural funding ($57 million, peer-reviewed; $12.4 million, non-peer-reviewed)."

The Quantum GX2 microCT allows for rapid, high resolution imaging of anatomical, functional and metabolic endpoints in multiple rodent species. The Quantum GX2 microCT will provide state-of-the art in vivo imaging capabilities not currently available on the WJB Dorn Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC)/University of South Carolina School of Medicine (USCSOM) campus and moreover will compliment and directly interface with the IVIS Spectrum system previously purchased by a successful VA equipment grant application. As such, the Quantum GX2 microCT imaging system will fundamentally impact the research capabilities of investigators at the Dorn VAMC and USCSOM.  The Quantum GX2 microCT Imaging System is designed for a spectrum of in vivo imaging settings optimized either to high resolution (voxel sizes down to 4.5 m) or high speed (8 second scan time); the system also allows investigators to modify these parameters (scan speed and resolution) for their particular research needs. An important feature of the Quantum GX2 is the ability to produce 3D reconstructions of an entire animal, as well as 3D reconstructions of a target field of view based on investigator specifications. In addition to measures including bone density, bone morphology, tumor identification/quantification, and body composition (subcutaneous and visceral fat) analysis, in vivo analyses such cardiac and pulmonary function can also be performed as well as imaging changes in brain. Importantly, the Quantum GX2 microCT scanner is optimized for longitudinal analyses, which is directly applicable to the studies being performed at the Dorn VAMC/USCSOM that are investigating the functional and anatomical basis for diseases that are directly relevant to the mission of the VA, including PTSD, affective disorders, obesity, cardiovascular disease and immune disorders.  The Quantum GX2 microCT Imaging System represents an integrated and powerful in vivo imaging system that is extremely flexible in that it can be individually tailored for the precise experimental needs of all the participating investigators and will thereby significantly enhance the physical research infrastructure at the Dorn VAMC. This state-of-the-art technology will transform the level of our analyses of veteran-relevant disease models by allowing anatomical and functional assessments in vivo during disease progression, as well as effects of therapeutic interventions in these models. As such, this powerful imaging system will facilitate research that is directly relevant to the mission of the VA with the ultimate goal being the identification of novel strategies to advance the health care of Veterans."
"9541948","Immune cells have diverse functions, from regulatory roles in tissue homeostasis to inflammatory responses against foreign challenges. In autoimmune disease, affected immune cells acquire a pathogenic state characterized by chronic activation of proinflammatory genes. CD4+ Th17 cells exemplify this functional plasticity, acting as protective agents in gut function or harmful instigators of inflammation in autoimmune disease. Th17 cells have been shown to be disease-causing agents in several autoimmune disorders affecting >10 million Americans, including multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Previous studies have revealed considerable heterogeneity in the ability of Th17 cells to induce disease and become pathogenic in animal models of multiple sclerosis. My objective is to identify the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that control Th17 plasticity toward a pathogenic fate in autoimmune disease. I hypothesize that Th17 effector function is encoded in the epigenome and this can be leveraged to identify transcription regulators and remodeling events that distinguish the pathogenic state from regulatory function in Th17 cells in autoimmune disease.  By applying recent advances in massively parallel single-cell epigenomics, computational methods for predicting transcription factor binding and deciphering single-cell variation, and technologies for targeted genetic perturbation10,12,17, I will test my hypothesis through the following aims: (1) Use the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq to identify an epigenetic signature defining the Th17 pathogenic fate in the context of in vitro cytokine-induced Th17 polarization; (2) Characterize epigenetic heterogeneity in Th17 pathogenic cell fate using single-cell ATAC-seq during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an autoimmune disease model of multiple sclerosis, and use this heterogeneity to identify potential transcription factor regulators of Th17 autoimmunity; and (3) Perform genetic perturbation experiments during Th17 polarization and measure impact on gene expression and chromatin accessibility in order to determine mechanisms of candidate drivers for establishing the Th17 pathogenic fate.  With these studies, I will reconstruct the epigenetic regulatory circuits, consisting of transcription factors, target genes, and regulatory elements that control the disease-causing, pro-inflammatory cell fate of Th17 cells. These studies will provide important insights into the epigenetic networks that control nuanced cell function and reveal targeted strategies to reprogram immune cell pathogenic states in autoimmune disease without affecting non-pathogenic Th17 function."
"9673649","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prevention of hospitalization has long been viewed as a major health benefit of the use of influenza vaccine. This was, in large part, the rationale for the initial vaccination programs targeting the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. However, in the last decade, questions have been raised about the value of such programs. Modern study designs to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) have required laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, as well as documentation of vaccine receipt and the use of a test-negative design to control for differences in healthcare-seeking behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. There is a need for current estimates of VE in preventing influenza-associated hospitalization using these methods. We propose estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza hospitalization in two health systems in Michigan, where we have been conducting annual assessments of VE in various populations since 2008. We will conduct surveillance at two hospitals, and will enroll adult in-patients with acute respiratory infection. Vaccination status will be reported and documented, and considered with laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to estimate vaccine effectiveness for prevention of hospitalization. Analyses will use a test- negative design; those testing positive for influenza ar cases, those testing negative are controls. Modifiers and confounders of vaccine effectiveness such as age, health status, high-risk health conditions, functional status, frailty, education, tim from illness onset to specimen collection, calendar time, and propensity for vaccination will be assessed. In addition to our proposed influenza surveillance and VE assessment, we propose an estimation of the incidence of hospitalization in adults due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV and other respiratory viruses. This will allow for the evaluation of bias in influenza VE assessment due to interaction between influenza vaccination, infection, and non-influenza respiratory viruses, and will establish a platform for the future evaluation of RSV vaccines. We will accomplish these additional objectives by expanding our surveillance to months before and after the typical influenza season and evaluating specimens by molecular methods for RSV and other respiratory viruses."
"9644698","Cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. As such the President of the United States has recently established the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force, the mission of which is to eliminate cancer as we know it. Part of this mission is to encourage development of novel cancer treatments. This innovative multi-PI proposal represents a novel approach to this challenge. Oncogenic activation of the Ras family of GTPases occurs in ~30% of cancers making it the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers. Despite a great deal of progress in our understanding of the biochemistry of Ras and it's role in tumorigenesis, development of effective therapeutic inhibitors of Ras to date has been disappointing. Thus, there remains a critical need to develop targeted inhibitors of this oncoprotein for treatment of patients with Ras-positive tumors. Using an unbiased, protein engineering approach, we will develop high affinity reagents that specifically target each of the three Ras isoforms present in human tumors, namely H-Ras, K-Ras, and N- Ras. These reagents will then be used to develop small molecule inhibitors to Ras. We propose 4 major aims to accomplish our goals. In Aim 1, we will utilize the monobody platform to isolate highly specific affinity reagents that target each Ras isoform and characterize their in vitro specificity. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of these monobody reagents on Ras-mediated signaling activity, focusing primarily on the ERK-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways which are the major targets of oncogenically activated Ras. Aim 3 will then define the biologic activity of monobodies at inhibiting Ras-mediated transformation in several pre-clinical models including 2D/3D culture systems, mouse xenograft assays and transgenic animal models for Ras tumorigenesis. Finally, Aim 4 will utilize a high content screening approach to identify small molecule mimetics of these monobody inhibitors which will serve as lead Ras inhibitors. These studies represent a unique and powerful approach toward developing highly specific Ras inhibitors and thus have the potential to make a major impact on cancer therapy. In addition, this project is highly relevant to the mission of National Cancer Institute's recently established Ras Initiative at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research which is charged with targeting Ras-dependent cancers."
"9440365","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer accounts for one-fourth of all cancer deaths in the U.S. Adenocarcinoma (ADC) is the most prevalent lung cancer histological subtype, accounting for 40% of cases and 65,000 deaths in the U.S. each year. Notch signaling is aberrantly activated in 40% of lung ADCs and is associated with poor overall survival. We and others have shown that Notch regulates cancer stem cells (CSCs), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and chemotherapy resistance in lung ADC, contributing to tumor progression. Unfortunately, as with many therapies against pleiotropic pathways, targeted therapies against Notch, including gamma secretase inhibitors (GSIs), have been largely unsuccessful due to dose-limiting toxicities or resistance. Thus, identification and successful targeting of novel effectors of Notch signaling may alleviate resistance and toxicities caused by generalized Notch inhibition while providing effective therapeutics for the treatment of lung ADC. Based upon microRNA microarrays performed on human lung ADC cell lines overexpressing or repressing Notch1 and tissues from a Notch1-induced lung ADC mouse model, we propose that miR-21 may be a direct Notch1 target microRNA (miRNA). Functionally, miR-21, which is regulated by Kras and TGF, has roles in CSCs, EMT, and chemoresistance and it has been shown that overexpression of miR-21 is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Thus, the central hypothesis of this work is that miR-21 is a direct Notch1 target miRNA that participates in mediating Notch1-induced CSC phenotypes, EMT, and resistance to chemotherapy in lung ADC. This research aims to define miR-21 as a direct target of canonical Notch1 signaling in lung ADC through mechanistic gain- and loss-of-function studies, as well as demonstration that Notch1 binds to a putative RBP-J? binding site on miR-21's promoter. Additionally, CSC and EMT functional assays will test miR-21's role in mediating Notch1's contribution to CSC maintenance and EMT induction. Since it has been shown previously that miR-21 contributes to paclitaxel resistance, this research aims to demonstrate that GSI-mediated repression of miR-21 in combination with paclitaxel contributes to synergistic anti-tumor activity in Kras-wild type lung ADC. Synergy will be tested in preclinical mouse xenograft studies, while knocking down or overexpressing miR-21 in combination with paclitaxel and/or GSIs will assess the role of miR-21 in mediating drug synergy. These proposed studies will provide new understandings of miRNA-mediated oncogenic pathways in lung ADC progression and chemoresistance, highlighting miR-21 as a potential mediator of Notch1's role in lung ADC. In the end, the results could lead to elucidation of novel targets for lung cancer therapy while bypassing the toxicities and resistance caused by targeting pleiotropic and redundant oncogenic pathways."
"9469372","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  Prior research indicates that a systemic lack of well-being in our nation is majorly contributing to growing populations of individuals with poor mental health. On the other hand, studies show that flourishing adults with high-levels of psychological well-being (PWB) ? the core elements of human development that lead person to achieve self-fulfillment in life ? have the lowest prevalence ratesof mental disorder or comorbidity. Although various PWB interventions, such as contemplative and positive practices have been shown to effectively promote PWB in targeted groups, to date, most studies of these interventions have lacked the ability to rigorously test their real-world efficacy in terms of how success varies from person to person and amidst daily life challenges. As a solution, we propose employing the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design to create an integrated tool for (1) rigorous, multifaceted assessment of PWB and (2) delivering PWB interventions in real life settings, with person-centered statistical inference tailored for developing and evaluating EMA-based approaches to increase PWB.  EMA is a potential intervention delivery platform that could enhance the efficacy and implementation of PWB interventions. EMA is a technology-based research approach aimed at capturing the ongoing stream of individuals' behavior in real-world settings, to maximize the extent to which research findings generalize to everyday life. EMA's accessible delivery methods use wearable or smartphone technologies that most people own or could easily obtain. By design, EMA impacts engagement ? a key element of PWB ? and intervention adherence. EMA also offers benefits associated with intensive monitoring to promote adherence and insight into daily variability which can predict outcomes. Multiple prior studies have used the EMA design for PWB- EMA, which we define as any EMA design applied to assess elements of PWB, however these studies have yet to systematically examine the pathways through which PWB-EMA can affect PWB. Furthermore, research has yet to systematically test the efficacy of PWB-EMA as a platform for PWB intervention delivery and assessment ? which we term PWB-EMAI (PWB-EMA-intervention). The proposed research involves two arms: firstly, to study the unique role of PWB-EMA in facilitating PWB in everyday life settings; and secondly, to build up a methodological toolkit to test PWB-EMAI with contemplative and positive intervention elements in everyday life settings.  Based on mounting empirical evidence, psychology researchers are calling for new investment in U.S. mental health research and services to rigorously implement interventions that promote PWB and foster mental health in our population. Our proposal answers this call by offering innovative methodological assessment that elucidates individual differences in how PWB-EMA (1) is a unique facilitator of PWB, (2) can be used to efficiently deliver a PWB intervention, and (3) within-person dynamics in PWB elements, and how these relate to intervention success. The proposed study will use existing data from a parent study that conducted a PWB- EMA and PWB-EMAI using randomized control design. We will measure the success of each intervention with advanced longitudinal analyses with unique advantages for rigorous, real-time assessment. Upon completion this study aims to disseminate methodological tools for future researchers and to advance knowledge about how PWB-EMA can be used to assess and improve PWB interventions, in order to deliver lasting benefits to researchers, public health, and society as a whole."
"9243997","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in science and biotechnology have led to an explosion of data from the plethora of rapidly developing high throughput analyses. While these advances have led to major improvements in the therapy of several refractory malignancies, most advanced cancers remain incurable. The Southwest Early Clinical Trials (SECT) Consortium consists of University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center, and is strategically and geographically placed to lead, collaborate on and execute phase I clinical trials in the NCI Experimental Therapeutics-Clinical Trials Network in broad patient populations, including in several underserved regions. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Study, in an efficient and collaborative manner, the safety and clinical activity of new agents or hypothesis-driven novel combinations. 2. Molecularly profile patients (host tissues) and their malignancies to optimize selection of potentially relevant therapy for each patient, based on identified molecular aberrations, where appropriate. 3. Develop clinically relevant pharmacodynamic markers of response. 4. Mentor junior faculty, trainees, and research personnel, as applicable, in the leadership, conduct, analysis, and reporting of ET-CTN and other clinical trials. 5. Provide scientific and administrative leadership within ET-CTN, including active participation in project teams, research design and protocol development, authorship/co-authorship of Network group publications, and participation in scientific, administrative, or ad hoc committees, as well as participation in the NCI Central IRBs and attendance at ET-CTN and IDSC meetings. In addition to established proficiency in clinical trial accrual, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic assessment, the SECT Institutions have an unparalleled combination of resources that include access to large patient populations with extensively genotyped tumors, established biorepositories, state of the art clinical genomics capabilities, and expert bioinformatics. Led by three experienced principle investigators with complementary skills, the SECT consortium is poised to execute a new paradigm for early experimental therapeutic clinical trials, with the goals to validate the right pathways, target thee pathways with the right drugs, and test these drugs in the right patients.         RELEVANCE:  Early oncology clinical trials have traditionally focused on defining the maximum tolerated dose for phase II development. Recent development of novel targeted agents demand a different approach that includes: 1) testing in a molecularly profiled population; 2) evaluation f intermediate biologic endpoints; and 3) determination of the optimal biologic dose for Phase II studies."
"9469023","Abstract  The goal of this project is to determine how the RNA binding protein CELF1 (also known as CUGBP1) contributes to skeletal muscle wasting in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DM1 is an adult-onset neuromuscular disorder and more than half of DM1 mortality is due to muscle wasting. The mechanisms leading to skeletal muscle wasting remain unknown. DM1 is caused by expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3' UTR of the Dystrophia Myotonica-Protein Kinase (DMPK) gene. The CTG repeats are transcribed and DM1 pathogenesis is due to a gain of function of the expanded CUG repeat mRNA. The expanded repeat RNA disrupts the function of RNA binding proteins. The RNA sequesters the MBNL family of RNA binding proteins producing a loss of function which leads to RNA processing abnormalities resulting in disease features. A second RNA binding protein effected by the repeat RNA is CELF1. CELF1 protein is post-transcriptionally up- regulated 2-4 fold in DM1 skeletal muscle. The sponsor?s lab previously reported that inducible overexpression of CELF1 in adult skeletal muscle of transgenic mice reproduces DM1-like defects in muscle function and histology. CELF1 functions in the nucleus as a splicing regulator and in the cytoplasm as a regulator of mRNA stability and translation. I have recently generated and tested transgenic mice for skeletal muscle-specific and tetracycline-inducible expression of active CELF1 derivatives localized exclusively to either the nucleus or the cytoplasm. These transgenic animals will be used for muscle-specific expression to determine whether a gain of CELF1 nuclear or cytoplasmic functions contribute to DM1 pathogenesis and muscle wasting.  I will achieve this through two specific aims. In the first specific aim transgenic mice inducibly expressing modified versions of mCherry-tagged human CELF1 that localize exclusively to the nucleus or cytoplasm will be used to determine whether the nuclear and/or cytoplasmic roles of CELF1 leads to pathogenesis. I will validate effects on CELF1 nuclear and cytoplasmic targets and systematically characterize muscle function and histology. In the second specific aim I will use RNA-seq to identify CELF1-associated transcriptome changes likely to contribute to skeletal muscle wasting in DM1. RNA-seq from skeletal muscle of either the nuclear or cytoplasmic line (or both) will be filtered against available RNA-seq data sets from skeletal muscle of individuals affected by DM1, a mouse model in the sponsor?s lab that express CUG repeat RNA and show muscle wasting, as well as models of CELF1 up-regulation. Additionally, I will determine the extent to which the muscle wasting phenotype of animals that express expanded repeat RNA is rescued by Celf1 loss of function by AAV-shRNA mediated Celf1 knockdown. RNA-seq from rescued animals will provide an additional data set to identify the molecular changes that correlate with phenotypic rescue."
"9456117","PROJECT SUMMARY  International Labor Organization (ILO) has recently drawn attention to migrant child laborers as an  underreported but highly vulnerable group. ILO has argued that migrant child laborers are even more  vulnerable compared to local child laborers due to harsher working conditions, less visibility, lack of parental  protection, and heightened disenfranchisement. Hence, a deeper understanding of the family circumstances  and processes in this context is critical in developing more effective interventions targeting this population.  According to ILO, 68 million children (ages 5 and 17) are child laborers, constituting about 11% of the child  population worldwide. Forty-one percent of these child laborers are female. Child labor has been associated  with serious health, developmental, educational, and psychological risks for youth.  Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) continues to be the continent with the highest incidence (21.7%) of child labor. Ghana is one of the SSA countries with the highest incidence of child labor (21.8%), 47% of which are females. In Ghana, adolescent girls frequently migrate alone from three highly impoverished northern regions to the southern cities to work as laborers in the informal economy. Adolescent girls increasingly make up the majority of the North-South migrants. Yet, there is a scarcity of research on the beliefs and attitudes of parents towards child independent migration and child labor. There is also limited understanding of the complex family processes behind the migration of adolescent girls to work as child laborers. These gaps are critical to address in order to have a more complete and contextualized understanding of girls' migration for work, which will subsequently inform policies and programs for more effective interventions.  In light of the gaps in the literature, the purpose of this qualitative study is to explore parental ethnotheories  on childhood, child independent migration, and child labor, as well as family processes behind decision making  including multi-level factors (both protective and risk) that influence female children's/ adolescents' migration  from home to work as child laborers. The study will explore the perspectives of three groups of  parents/caregivers (n=90) from sending villages in two of the poorest districts of Northern region with adolescent  daughters: 1. who migrated to work in the informal economy; 2. who dropped out of school but stayed in their  village; and 3.who remained in school full-time. Given the gap in knowledge on parental perspectives on female  child/adolescent migration for work in the cities, the findings of the proposed research study will contribute to  the literature on child/adolescent migration for child labor. The findings will also allow for more effective and  developmentally-, and contextually-relevant interventions.  The proposed study is relevant to global public health as it will provide insights into the push factors that  lead female children/adolescents to migrate alone to the city for child labor, which has critical negative  psychosocial and health outcomes."
"9503568","Joint replacement surgery is the most common inpatient surgery in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). 14,349 primary joint replacement cases were performed in the VHA in 2015. About 5% are reoperated by 10 years for failure or infection. Poor implants have a much higher reoperation rate (e.g. 17-25% by 5 years for the DePuy ASR XL). Failed or unsatisfactory joint replacements are costly and result in personal and financial hardship for veteran patients. In addition, failed joint replacements cost the health care system about $38,000 per episode. As implant designs and techniques evolve, some changes can have a negative effect on implant survival and harm patients. A prime example of this is metal on metal hip arthroplasty, which recently resulted in recall of several commonly used implants.  To limit harm to patients and costs for the health care system, we must improve our ability to monitor implant performance and identify poorly performing implants earlier than is now possible. Medical records are a potentially rich source of information that may allow early identification of poorly performing implants even before they end up having to be revised, and potentially sparing new patients from receiving them.  The VHA is the nation's largest integrated health care system and was among the earliest adopters of the electronic health record (EHR). VHA EHRs may be used to create a VA joint implant registry. This could inform future decisions on implant selection across the VA health care system to improve veteran patient outcomes and minimize reoperations or complications. In addition, a VA joint replacement registry could act to support a national implant surveillance system by computationally extracting and aggregating individual prosthetic data for use by the FDA.  We propose a pilot project to extract and evaluate joint replacement prosthesis implantation and explantation information from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). The specific aims of the proposed pilot work are: Aim 1: Determine trends in national joint replacement implant use and regional variation in the VA from 2000 to 2016. To establish a foundation for our overall goal of developing a post market surveillance system for joint replacement, it will be essential to retrieve implant-specific information from the CDW across the VHA over time, including Operative Date, Station, CPT code, Prosthesis Vendor, Prosthesis Model, Prosthesis Size, and Prosthesis Name. After evaluating the completeness of these records across the VHA over time, we will use these records to characterize implantation practices for each station and each calendar year. This will support further study by quantifying trends in national joint replacement implant use and provide insight into regional variation in implant selection across the VA system. Aim 2: Build a level 1 registry of joint replacement implants in the VA system. A level 1 registry is made up of patient demographics, hospital, surgeon, and procedure-related data including the laterality of surgery, date of surgery and implant utilized. Not all of this information is available in structured records. For example since laterality of the operation is not directly found in a structured field, we will need to analyze unstructured fields to determine the fate of the index operation. Part (a) of this aim will focus on extracting laterality information for both index surgery and any subsequent reoperations from unstructured fields. This will tell us how long the joint prosthesis lasted before it needed to be reoperated on. Part (b) of the aim will require a more challenging analysis of unstructured data to determine which component of the joint replacement was problematic and removed. By completing this aim, we will generate reports on the individual component survivorship free of reoperation or removal for each of the implants used across the VA health care system."

The Univ. of Pittsburgh and UPMC Health System (UPMC) are located in Allegheny County (AC), in which influenza is reportable & which has one of the 5 oldest populations in the U.S. We propose a test-negative case-control study of influenza VE in 2 UPMC hospitals to determine VE against hospitalizations of adults. UPMC has been on the US News honor roll for over a decade, including most wired and has a strong research tradition. The influenza season will be determined from syndromic surveillance from multiple hospital EDs, the Health Dept. (ACHD), & from lab data from >14,000 respiratory viral panels (RVP) done annually at UPMC. Theradoc informatics will identify adult inpatients who have had an RVP conducted. Enrollees' survey data will be directly entered into NIH's REDCap. Frailty can be assessed by survey and/or electronic medical record (EMR) data (e.g., Charleson Co-morbidity Index) to assess confounders and effect modifiers. Our Data Center manages REDCap data, EMR data from hospitalizations, & immunization data for uploading to CDC. Population-based incidence of influenza hospitalizations will be determined from ACHD and UPMC St. Margaret hospitalization data and by agent-based modeling at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Our team is a strong candidate for this project because: 1) UPMC is the dominant regional health system with a strong bond rating; 2) infection control personnel recommend RVPs to establish diagnoses, and our team's leadership responsibilities at the hospitals can further influence the use of RVPs; 3) we have published data showing excellent concordance between UPMC's GenMark RVP and the CDC's PCR for detecting influenza; 4) research shows better protection in the elderly from high-dose influenza (HD) vaccine; UPMC has recommended and promoted HD vaccine in large quantities, although regular vaccine is available, allowing for vaccine type comparisons; 5) UPMC's EMR links inpatient and outpatient vaccination records, and interfaces with the state immunization registry; 6) it includes diverse, well-published investigators who have worked together previously."

"9414451","CONSORTIUM CORE  Interventions that target 3 levels of influence appear well-suited to the study and treatment of chronic diseases,  the origins of which are virtually always multifactorial. However, a recent literature review found only 12 published  multilevel interventions aimed at reducing health disparities provided enough data to derive a quantitative  estimate of the intervention?s effect on health outcomes. Only 6 were randomized, controlled trials; and none  focused primarily on blood pressure control. Because implementation is a major obstacle in multilevel trials, the  selection of academic and community partners is crucial to the successful implementation of multilevel  interventions with underserved groups. The Native-Controlling Hypertension And Risks through Technology  (Native-CHART) program will not be limited to the researchers and local partners in our Intervention Projects.  Instead, we will build a nationwide network of 7 Satellite Centers that will assist in education, implementation,  dissemination, policy, and advocacy initiatives critical to our ultimate success. The Outreach, Engagement, and  Dissemination Committee and the Steering Committee, in which NIMHD scientific staff will play key roles, will  ensure local, regional, and national community involvement in needs assessment, project planning and design,  implementation, and dissemination of results. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) plan, conduct, and evaluate  engagement and collaborative activities that expand our network and address the priorities pertaining to  hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke and related risk factors among American Indian, Alaska Native,  and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander people; 2) bring stakeholders more fully into the research process through  the Satellite Centers and a communication infrastructure, including annual conferences, to optimize the uptake  of effective interventions at local, regional, and national levels; 3) with the Satellite Centers and Methodology  Core, conduct annual assessments pertinent to hypertension to determine relevant local, regional, and national  needs and priorities; 4) with the Dissemination Core, promote a scientifically rigorous and culturally informed  program that acquires, applies, and distributes knowledge for preventing and treating hypertension,  cardiovascular disease, and stroke and its risk factors ? one that holds promise for improving health equity for  our populations of interest; and 5) collaborate with community and governing agencies to implement or  strengthen regulations and policies to foster research partnerships between communities and academic  institutions and protect the former from harm. This Core will be a focal point for multilevel intervention research  on hypertension among American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders."

The multimedia pieces include high definition video animation of peripheral and central nervous system cells and tissues presented in digital dome planetariums. Shows will also be produced as DVDs, companion video games and interactive media for museum kiosks. Aspects of the stories will be crafted into interactive eBook stories with logic and branching scenarios that teach the user about the fundamental principles and mechanisms of the nervous system. The topics that we plan to develop include, but are not limited, to the following: (1) Pain - something that everyone experiences, but almost no one understands how and where it comes from. (2) Learning and Memory in relationship to both childhood development and healthy insights into the needs of the functioning brain, including sleep. (3) Interactions of the Immune System and the Nervous System. The partnership is realized by the synergistic, coordinated activity of three distinct groups: (A) museums and schools, (B) intellectual partners, (C) production partners.

While complex health and science learning goals are typically studied in middle school, we have found that younger students are very capable of understanding and appreciating the underlying fundamental principles when presented in a manner that is both accessible and meaningful to the child. We believe that building a stronger fundamental understanding of neuroscience early on will dramatically enhance the learning that can be achieved later in middle school. (B) The intellectual and medical partnership include the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at the University of Pittsburgh (a CTSA); Chronic Pain Research Consortium at Duquesne University and the Center for Pain Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Additional colleagues from the Duquesne University School of Education, the Liberal Arts College Department of Multimedia, and the Center for Health Care Ethics will participate. Colleagues from the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh will also contribute their expertise. (C) The production partnership includes our staff of multimedia experts and the Entertainment Technology Center, Carnegie Mellon University. An external advisory committee will provide oversight and guidance. Independent evaluators including Rockman et al will work with us to contribute formative and summative evaluations of audience knowledge and attitudes, as well as a small-scale randomized-control trial."
"9437853","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by multifocal regions of inflammation and myelin destruction. Typically, MS runs a protracted clinical course lasting over several decades with episodes of exacerbation followed by variable periods of remission. Available evidence indicates that the cause of MS is multifactorial and includes the genetic background of the individual as well as environmental influences, e.g. viral infection. The development of animal models in which the clinical and histologic pathology is similar to that observed in the majority of MS patients is imperative in order to attempt to better understand the underlying pathological mechanisms contributing to MS. Viral models of demyelination are important tools for studying the pathogenesis of disease. Persistent infection of mice with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is characterized by axonal damage and ongoing demyelination mediated by inflammatory T cells and macrophages, which is similar both clinically and histologically to the human demyelinating disease MS. Combined with the fact that an environmental agent such as a virus is considered to be a contributing cause of MS, the JHMV and TMEV systems offer excellent models in which to study both the underlying pathological mechanisms that may drive demyelination in MS patients as well as novel therapeutic methods for promoting remyelination.  Axonal damage is a key feature in the pathogenesis of MS. Following CNS infection with either JHMV or TMEV, there is extensive axonal damage that often precedes immune cell infiltration and demyelination. Understanding the molecular/cellular mechanisms by which axonopathy occurs in response to viral infection of the CNS will aid in uncovering novel ways to promote axonal sparing. Along these lines, employment of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) offers an attractive approach to both protect axons and initiate remyelination. We have determined that intraspinal transplantation of mouse NPCs into JHMV-infected mice with established demyelination results in improved clinical outcome associated with the differentiation of NPCs into oligodendroglia, extensive axonal sparing and remyelination. Our new results demonstrate that engrafted NPCs physically engage axons resulting in axonal preservation and remyelination. This proposal will interrogate (i) the molecular and cellular mechanisms resulting in axonopathy following viral infection of the CNS and (ii) mechanisms associated with NPC-mediated axonal preservation and remyelination."

"9648208","Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response."

Institutional Career Development Core Abstract The UNC/TraCS KL2 is the flagship program through which we shape the development of junior translational scientists to become Principal Investigators and research leaders. Since our inception, we have funded 63 Scholars: 15 are currently supported on the KL2, and 48 have completed the Program. Of these 48, 46 are funded academic investigators; one is a clinician; and one holds a research position in industry. Our success to date is exemplified by the fact that 73% of our ?graduated? Scholars have received significant (over $100,000 for a single grant) independent PI funding within 54 months of their starting the KL2. Our Scholars represent 6 Schools and 17 departments, a diversity that not only distinguishes this KL2 from other training programs on campus, but also encourages and facilitates translational collaborations among Scholars who might not otherwise cross paths. This highly successful program is grounded in a philosophy of team science across disciplines, schools, and centers/institutes; an outstanding corps of expert faculty who are committed to work closely with the mentors and Scholars as part of a coordinated team approach to faculty development; program leadership that keeps abreast of the evolving scientific and programmatic priorities of the CTSA Program; and a collegial culture in which our former Scholars willingly continue to be engaged and give time and expertise back to the program as role models, mentors, and collaborators. Going forward, the KL2 Program is adapting to the changing nature of our applicant pool and the evolving translational workforce pipeline by replacing the mandatory two-year curriculum with personalized training pathways developed by Scholars in collaboration with KL2 program faculty and their mentors. In addition, we have established the KL2 Alumni Advisory Team, in which KL2 graduates provide feedback about training components and advice on new content or redesign of how current content is delivered. Other changes include increasing collaborative activities with the CTSA Consortium, integrating new initiatives such as the NCATS Trial Innovation Network and TraCS Workforce Development Program into training activities, expanding activities in mentoring, and introducing a set of competencies in scientific and research leadership. Goal 1: Train KL2 Scholars to apply their disciplinary expertise to translational science and equip them with the strategic thinking and management skills needed to create and sustain transformative interdisciplinary translational research programs in a rapidly changing environment. Goal 2: Provide KL2 Scholars with the skills to mentor members of their own research teams as well as the next generation of investigators. TraCS serves as a true ?home? for early-stage researchers who wish to engage in shared learning, peer review and, most importantly, the development of a peer group that encourages innovation, resilience, and retention in science. Our KL2 Program provides Scholars with experiences that enable them to transcend methodologic boundaries, adopt concepts from other disciplines, and produce truly transformative translational science.

"9433601","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) presents formidable problems. Therefore, among the many important goals for future HIV research is the development of temporally contained therapies capable of eradicating HIV infection. The persistence of quiescent HIV infection within populations of CD4+ T cells is currently a major obstacle to eradication of HIV infection. We will continue proof-of-concept studies attempting to directly and precisely measure the induction of proviral expression from the latently infected CD4+ cell reservoir, and the depletion of infection within that reservoir.  We have demonstrated the ability of the HDAC inhibitor licensed for use in oncology, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (Vorinostat, VOR), selective for Class I HDACs, to induce HIV expression in the resting CD4+ T cells of antiretroviral-treated, aviremic HIV-infected patients in vivo. We have established the infrastructure and assays needed to document a repeated induction of resting CD4+ T cell-associated HIV RNA in vivo following repeated doses of VOR.  Clearance of this small, latent reservoir upon relatively brief proviral induction may not be possible in the absence of a robust HIV-specific immune response. We have selected 2nd proof-of-concept tool, Argos AGS-004, an autologous dendritic cell vaccine that has demonstrated the ability to induce immunity in vivo as measured by a clinically apparent reduction in rebound viremia after ART interruption. AGS-004 consists of dendritic cells (DCs) co-electroporated with in vitro transcribed (IVT) ribonucleic acid (RNA) encoding specific autologous HIV antigens (Gag, Vpr, Rev, and Nef) to achieve antigen presentation, with CD40 ligand RNA, to enhance DC functionality. We have established the infrastructure and assays needed to document the induction of an appropriately durable antiviral immune response following AGS-004.  We propose a proof-of-principal study to measure the potential of VOR and AGS-004 to deplete latent infection, following administration in a carefully validated combination: Specific Aim 1: The frequency of detectable HIV RNA expression within resting CD4+ T cells will increase  after repeated VOR exposure in vivo Specific Aim 2: AGS-004 will induce an HIV-specific immune in HIV-infected participants with durable viral  suppression on ART initiated, both prior to and following VOR administration.

"9525626","?    DESCRIPTION:    Hyperglycemia (i.e., elevated blood glucose) affects approximately 40% of acute ischemic stroke patients, regardless of a diabetes history. In experimental and clinical studies, hyperglycemia exacerbates ischemic brain injury by perpetuating aberrant glucose metabolism and hyperglycolysis-associated oxidative injury from excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Clinically, to address hyperglycemia in stroke, insulin has been implemented to normalize serum glucose levels. However no clear beneficial outcome has resulted from such treatment, mainly because of persistent hypoglycemia or inadequately controlled glucose levels. Therefore development of an alternative and effective therapy for hyperglycemia in stroke is highly desirable. Glucose is initially catabolized by glycolysis, and subsequently through the aerobic pathway to produce cellular ATP needed as the primary energy source for neural activity. In ischemia while oxidative phosphorylation of glucose is impaired due to oxygen deprivation, brain cells attempt to meet their new metabolic challenge by increasing anaerobic glycolysis (hyperglycolysis). Anaerobic glycolysis, which is very inefficient in ATP production, induces lactic acidosis thus ROS, especially upon reperfusion. ROS is further produced by activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX), which is generated during ischemia and enhanced by NADPH production through hyperglycolysis. Hibernating animals are known to adapt to a significant decrease of blood flow to the brain, which would be deleterious to a non-hibernating animal. Similarly, induction of a hibernation-like status after stroke may blunt brain damage associated with decreased or absence of blood flow. Experimental studies by us and others have demonstrated depressive roles of ethanol (ETOH) and phenothiazine neuroleptics (Chlorpromazine and Promethazine) in decreasing not only brain activity and glucose metabolism, but also ischemic brain damage. These effects raise the possibility that ETOH and phenothiazine drugs might serve as a novel neuroprotectant by its ability to regulate brain glucose metabolism after stroke. The proposed studies here address this putative capability. In rodent transient and permanent stroke models, we will first establish whether post-ischemia administration of ETOH or Chlorpromazine+Promethazine combination reduces brain injury and improve functional outcome (Aim 1). We will then test whether the proposed therapy reduces glucose uptake, utilization, metabolism and thus hyperglycolysis, in ischemic penumbra and hyperglycemia-associated brain (Aim 2). We will also determine whether our therapy prevents oxidative injury by ameliorating elevated glucose transporter expression and NOX complex formation and activation (Aim 3). Because post-stroke insulin treatment has been controversial, the proposed treatments may be more effective in reducing hyperglycemia-enhanced ischemic injury by both slowing cerebral glucose metabolism and attenuating glycolysis-associated NOX activity. This therapeutic value would then be developed as an effective approach in diabetic and stroke-induced hyperglycemia."
"9623976","Contact PD/PI: Dere, Willard H. ABSTRACT - OVERALL The University of Utah Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) serves as the central locus of translational research in the Intermountain West. The CCTS has become the center for combining the efforts of the University of Utah and its partners into a vibrant research enterprise which advances both clinical projects and the science of translational research. To realize these goals, the CCTS is led by Co-Principal Investigators Drs. Dere and Hess, who are well positioned within institutional leadership and are supported by a variety of institutional initiatives and resources that complement the CCTS activities. The Co-PIs are supported by an integrated group of experienced local, regional, and national leaders and are guided by a comprehensive oversight structure that anchors the CCTS within the University of Utah and its partners. Our proposal builds on a firm foundation of achievements in areas of strength which include but are not limited to: our genetics programs, which has led to discoveries of numerous disease-causing genes and to a variety of software platforms that are used in computational genomics globally; our community-outreach efforts, highlighted by state- and nationwide initiatives by key leaders; our statistical methods and software developed to evaluate surrogate markers; and our substantive experiences in clinical trials, both traditional randomized and pragmatic, and multi-center collaboration networks, which continue to study a variety of special populations identified by the recent NCATS Lifespan initiatives. By supporting successful trainees at all levels and preparing them for productive careers, we are building a diverse workforce able to use our extensive infrastructure to advance national CTSA goals. The breadth of the CCTS activities allows it to address established and emerging institutional issues by providing timely resources, advice, and services. We look forward to addressing major public health and translational research issues through a comprehensive suite of services, as well as a culture that prizes team science and high quality research in order to better ensure research reproducibility. We seek to achieve our goals through four specific aims: (1) Catalyze clinical and translational research as the CTSA hub for the Intermountain West; (2) Advance and refine an educational environment that maximizes the value of collaboration and training among various stakeholders; (3) Integrate diverse partners for meaningful collaborations in research endeavors across the translational spectrum; (4) Promote efficient and effective data collection, analyses, and sharing that leverages innovative informatics- based solutions.

"9541718","Project Summary The goal of this project is to test critical aspects of the neural mechanisms thought to underlie perceptually- guided choices, with reference to the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and its putative role in perceptual decision- making. A perceptual judgment is typically conceptualized as a covert process whereby sensory evidence is weighted for or against potential choice alternatives, governing the execution of an overt motor response. This dynamic process underlies all perceptually-guided behavior and involves a high level of coordination between sensory, motor, and cognitive (e.g. attentional, memory, and reward) systems. The neural basis of perceptually-guided behavior is typically studied using psychophysical tasks that afford the subject ample time to complete the formation of a perceptual judgment before reporting the outcome with a motor action. However, it is difficult, if not impossible to make accurate inferences about the dynamics of the decision- making process based on behavioral measurements taken only after the judgment has already concluded its development in time. To overcome this problem, the proposed study employs an ?urgent? decision-making paradigm, which allows for the temporal dynamics of a perceptual judgment to be inferred based on behavioral measures gathered throughout its evolution in time. The experiments are designed such that neuronal activity will be recorded from area LIP of non-human primates performing various urgent saccadic eye-movement tasks, in order to address two specific aims. The first aim is to elucidate the behavioral correlates of perceptual decision formation during performance of an urgent, dot-motion direction-discrimination task, as well as the corresponding neural correlates in area LIP. Preliminary results indicate that monkeys can accurately discriminate the direction of dot-motion within ~200 ms of stimulus onset, considerably sooner than previously thought. Do direction-sensitive signals in LIP develop early enough to inform such rapid, accurate choices? Thus far, the data show that they do not; i.e., under urgent conditions, motion-based signals in LIP develop too late to inform the subject's accurate behavioral discriminations. The second aim is to elucidate whether and how attentional context (i.e. top-down, bottom-up) influences the relationship between LIP activity and rapid visually-guided choice behavior. Overall, the findings tentatively suggest that, rather than a direct representation of sensory evidence integration (a widely held view), the activity in LIP may be better understood as an attentional signal that often correlates with, but is not a pre-requisite to accurate, visually- guided behavior. This investigation will help define the behavioral correlates and neural bases of rapid perceptual decision-making ? necessary steps toward improving the diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of many neurological conditions of contemporary societal concern (e.g., sensory neglect, ADHD, impulsivity)."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROMIS(r) measures have been developed to provide a systematic, domain-based approach to the assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) across the lifespan and disease groups; however, these instruments continue to be underutilized by the research community, including pediatric disease investigators. This PEPR proposal leverages three existing infrastructures of the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA), Cancer Pediatric PRO Research Network, and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Partners Kids and Teens Internet Cohort to further study legacy and newly developed PROMIS measures with the goal to enhance and promote their use by pediatric researchers and clinicians. There continues to be compelling need for PRO measures that parallel disease activity, identify high-risk patients, and reflect health outcomes important o patients and families. In addition, more robust understanding of relationships between patient factors and disease burden will promote successful care approaches and improved physical and mental health and social well-being. Two research projects are proposed for our multicenter longitudinal study of approximately 1500 children with rheumatic disease, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. The first research project addressed the need for clinical validation of PROMIS Pediatric measures including the following 3 aims: Aim 1. Evaluate the responsiveness of the PROMIS Pediatric measures to measure change in health over time and its association with clinical anchors and patient-reported symptom toxicities. Aim 2. Evaluate whether PROMIS measures of depression and anxiety are associated with subsequent measures of health status including physical and social functioning, substance use, and disease specific outcomes; Aim 3. Determine the association between steps taken (pedometer data) and PROMIS Pediatric measures in order to explore the use of pedometry data to augment PROs in research and clinical care. The second research project addresses the need to enhance the meaningfulness and usefulness of PROMIS measures and includes the following 3 aims: Aim 4. Identify unobserved subgroups of children with rheumatic disease, cancer, or IBD with respect to physical and mental health using latent profile analysis and latent transition analysis, and examine demographic and clinical characteristics associated with the subgroup classification and transition over time; Aim 5. Estimate a clinically minimally important difference (MID) in change in PROMIS Pediatric scores from the child's perspective and compare with the previously generated estimate of an MID of 3 points from qualitative scale-judgment methods; and Aim 6. Identify clinical cut scores along the PROMIS Pediatric metric associated with varying levels of symptom severity and functional status using standard setting methods with adolescents, parents, and clinicians. The Center's Data Management and Administrative Cores include experienced clinicians, behavioral scientists, statisticians, psychometricians, and information technology experts to facilitate, coordinate, and synergize these research studies."

"9649735","Project Summary/Abstract.  The proposal goal is to create a toolkit in which endogenous nuclear bodies (NBs) and chromatin compartments can be reversibly disrupted and endogenous genes can be moved among compartments. This toolkit will allow study of the functional interactions between NBs and chromatin and will be made widely available to the scientific community through the 4D Nucleome consortium. It is clear that chromatin reorganizes during differentiation, yet it is not well-understood how NBs interact with chromatin and influence this reorganization. For example, it has been difficult to study how organization of the repressive chromatin compartment might be seeded or affected by NBs such as the nucleolus because current tools are primarily limited to the study of exogenously expressed components and/or are not rapidly reversible. This toolkit will be developed in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) because they are primary cells that can be differentiated into multiple cell types by end users. In Specific Aim 1, auxin inducible degrons (AIDs) will be employed to construct systems in which NBs and chromatin compartments are rapidly and reversibly disrupted. The AID sequence will be stably integrated into both alleles of endogenous genes coding for A) proteins essential for the integrity of the nucleolus (as a test NB) and B) lamina proteins that anchor peripheral heterochromatin (PH, as a test compartment). In contrast to current RNAi knockdown or cre/lox-based knockout techniques, this approach will allow rapid degradation of target proteins (minutes/hrs vs days), is not dependent on the cell cycle and is rapidly reversible. In Specific Aim 2, a novel modified TetO/TetR system will be used to tether specific proteins of interest to individual genes and move genes among compartments. Tethering of specific nucleolar and laminar structural proteins to both active and inactive mESC genes will be used as test cases and proteins that most effectively move genes among compartments will be identified. This tethering system will be more useful than current systems because it will not affect the chromatin context of the target region (as do large repetitive arrays) nor risk off-target effects (as in nuclease deficient dCas9-based approaches). Labeling unique genes is also simpler and quicker as compared to the transcription activator?like effector (TALE) approach, where TALEs targeting multiple sequences must be synthesized. In Specific Aim 3 we describe proof of principle experiments in differentiating cells to test the redundancy of the heterochromatic compartment and characterize microdomains within the PH. We demonstrate by a collaboration that other researchers are interested in these tools. Successful implementation of these tools by the general scientific community would permit detailed study of the role that NBs play in chromatin organization and provide tethering tools to study how genes move between nuclear compartments during both development and disease."
"9414455","PROJECT 2  Abstract  Compared to other US populations, Alaska Native (AN) people face pervasive health disparities, especially for  stroke. Stroke mortality rates in ANs are at least 25% higher than their White counterparts in Alaska. Stroke  mortality for ANs under age 45 has increased 400%, but declined in Whites. Hypertension is the major modifiable  risk factor for stroke. Improving blood pressure (BP) control requires the involvement not only of individual  patients, but of healthcare systems and social environments. However, AN people face striking barriers in  healthcare access. Across Alaska, 60% of residents are medically underserved, and in 75% of communities  comprehensive healthcare services are accessible only by air or water. With the Southcentral Foundation (SCF),  we have designed a multilevel prevention trial ? ?Blood Pressure: Improving Control among Alaska Native  People? (BP-ICAN) ? that targets BP control among ANs diagnosed with hypertension. SCF uses a pre-paid,  patient-centered model to provide healthcare services in Anchorage and 55 remote villages for 65,000 patients.  Village residents have not participated in any past research. Using a group-randomized design, we will randomly  assign 58 SCF providers to the BP-ICAN intervention or control (usual practice) condition. We will query  electronic health records and sample ~10 patients per provider (total n = 500) who have a systolic BP ? 140  mmHg at 2 or more visits in the prior 18 months. Participants will receive equipment and training for home BP  measurements (HBPM) to self-manage hypertension. HBPM predicts cardiovascular disease morbidity,  mortality, and target organ damage better than BP readings obtained in clinics. Participant training will  emphasize self-efficacy. BP-ICAN also targets therapeutic inertia ? failure to modify therapy in response to  uncontrolled BP ? by facilitating patient-initiated communications about out-of-range HBPM readings. The  primary outcome is systolic BP; secondary outcomes are diastolic BP; adherence to antihypertensive medication;  adherence dyslipidemia and diabetes medications, if applicable; urine sodium and potassium, and changes in  modifiable risk factors, including smoking, diet, exercise, lipids, blood glucose, and weight. Our study capitalizes  on access to participants? electronic health records, enabling documentation of home- and clinic-based BP  readings, laboratory tests, clinical events, medication changes, provider behaviors, and participant-initiated visits  and communications. Our Specific Aims are: 1) at the individual level, to examine BP-ICAN?s impact on within-  person change in systolic BP and secondary outcomes from baseline to 12 months; 2) at the provider level, to  quantify impact on prescribing behaviors in response to participant-initiated reports or system-triggered alerts of  uncontrolled BP; and 3) at the system level, to evaluate overall impact on BP control among all hypertensive  patients regardless of enrollment into the individual-level intervention. BP control requires multilevel, evidence-  based strategies that optimize self-care, engage providers, and use patient reported-outcomes. An economic  analyses will inform the desirability of systems-wide policy changes at SCF to incorporate HBPM."

"9657504","Project Summary/Abstract  RNA editing is an evolutionarily conserved form of RNA processing that expands the functionality of the transcriptome. The most prevalent example is adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing wherein adenosine is chemically modified by enzymes to form inosine. The advent of sequencing-based methods has reignited interest in the RNA editing field, which has revealed a large number of previously unknown, edited sites. For example, a recent study identified close to 20,000 A-to-I sites in the human brain transcriptome, many of which were found on repetitive sequences. More studies have shown clinical correlations between A-to-I edited RNA and the onset of cancer and other diseases such as ALS. Surprisingly, we still know very little about how, why and where they happen due to a lack of tools for studying this important modification. Using innovative imaging techniques, we will visualize and quantify these events using oligonucleotide-based RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) in single cells to reveal the localization and mechanism of RNA editing. Ultimately, we believe that the addition of spatial and temporal information for this processing will increase the understanding of this important biological process and its role in gene expression. We have already validated a FISH-based method that can discriminate adenosines from inosines on glutamate receptor 2, a well-validated, partially edited mRNA for which editing results in an important neuronal phenotype. This proposal outlines the next steps for which we will utilize this new tool to explore the subcellular localization of edited transcripts. In the first aim, we will explore the translocation of edited transcripts in response to cellular stress. In aim two, we will characterize the cell-to-cell variability of A-to-I editing in single-cells. Finally, we will explore the role of hyper-edited Alu sequences in regulating the subcellular localization of the transcripts they are inserted in. Successful completion of these aims will provide an important tool for visualizing A-to-I edited transcripts in single cells, and define changes in subcellular localization of RNA as a function of editing. ."

"9416184","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The CNPRC has maintained a pedigreed colony of Indian origin rhesus macaques for over 15 years. This Indian origin rhesus population has an extensive pedigree and is self-sustaining with no additional animal recruitment necessary. This application proposes to expand both the number and quality of Indian origin SPF rhesus provided to AIDS funded investigators. This expansion and improvement in animal numbers and quality will be achieved in the following way. 1. Expand production of SPF Level 2 animals by using smaller corn-cribs for smaller, more flexible breeding groups. This will provide greater control over animal production to meet investigator needs. 2. Transfer the current colony database on the CNPRC Vitals computer program to a new LabKey platform that includes electronic medical records as well as a user friendly search function. 3. Develop improved and expanded screening and confirmatory tests for detection of SPF agents. 4. Transition the colony pedigree analysis from the current microsatellite platform to the SNP panel being developed by the Genetics and Genomics Working Group (GGWC) Consortium of the CNPRC. 5. Expand our characterization of the microbiome and immune phenotype of both levels of SPF animals and provide a unique biorepository of fecal and lymphocyte samples which will facilitate future research projects investigating the interaction of HIV with the host microbiome and immune system. The inclusion of the Biorepository Core is in response to research that suggests that knowledge of an individual animal's microbiome may be as important as understanding its MHC haplotype in studying both vaccine response and therapeutic intervention in AIDS related studies."
"9541906","PROJECT SUMMARY The serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter system comprises at least 14 distinct receptors that share topologically similar orthosteric sites, a fact that contributes to the historically difficult goal of sub-type selective modulation. Allosteric modulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can yield drug candidates for previously elusive receptors through targeting a structurally divergent allosteric site. Evidence suggests that dysregulated signaling of the 5-HT2C receptor underlies pathological processes implicated in numerous mental health disorders, including cocaine use disorder, which is without an FDA-approved medication. Interestingly, reduced 5-HT2C receptor signaling plays a modulatory role in stimulating relapse-related phenotypes in preclinical models of cocaine addiction, and conversely, rescuing this dysfunction may provide clinical utility to promote and maintain abstinence. We hypothesize that the rational design of novel 5-HT2C receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and optimization of 5-HT2C receptor PAM lead compounds will serve as a useful strategy to rescue pathologically decreased 5-HT2C receptor signaling and, ultimately, suppress relapse-related behavioral phenotypes. To this end, 4-alkylpiperidine-2-carboxamides were designed and synthesized in a PAM hit-to-lead discovery effort. The work resulted in the discovery of two novel lead compounds, which displayed subtype- selective functional enhancement of the 5-HT2C receptor, and lacked intrinsic agonism, in vitro. Leads, CTW0415 and CYD-6-2-1, exhibited favorable in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics, while a broad-panel GPCR screen confirmed selectivity. In addition, these leads maintain adequate lead-like physicochemical characteristics and represent ideal molecules upon which to build our lead optimization efforts. Our iterative strategy for 5-HT2C receptor PAM lead optimization will enable robust structure activity relationship (SAR) and will be accomplished by 1) rational design and synthesis of novel 5-HT2C receptor selective PAMs; and 2) biological characterization in a cell-based 5-HT2C receptor functional assay and pharmacological characterization in a radioligand binding assay. The proposed work will advance our knowledge of 5-HT2C receptor positive allosteric modulation and provide insight towards PAM mechanism. Additionally, the current PAM lead compounds require activity enhancements via optimization to enable development of preclinical candidates. The completion of this proposal will foster technical expertise and scientific intuition, ultimately enabling the applicant to achieve the goal of becoming an academic chemical biologist studying drug use disorders and the neuropharmacology of drugs of abuse. The applicant will gain experience in medicinal, organic and computational chemistry; neuroscience; molecular and cellular pharmacology; GPCR targeting experimental design; and the fundamentals of drug discovery in allosteric modulation, neurobiology and the psychostimulant addiction fields. Taken together, the present studies represent a high impact approach towards the discovery of neurotherapeutics for cocaine use disorder, and will generate novel tools to elucidate 5-HT2C receptor function and potential therapeutic candidates."

"9412506","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Historically, the primary focus of Transfusion Medicine specialists has been the immune compatibility of blood types as well as the safe and appropriate use of blood products. As a consequence of the tremendous growth in the knowledge of blood cell biology, the functions and responsibilities of Transfusion Medicine specialists have expanded to now also include the translation of cell-based therapies. Transfusion Medicine specialists are valued medical and scientific consultants to their colleagues in other disciplines, including among others surgery, cardiology, anesthesiology, neonatology, hematology/oncology. There is a recognized need for scientific training of individuals to further advance knowledge and translation of hematopoietic cellular therapies. The overall goal of the Program in Transfusion Biology and Cellular Therapies is to prepare M.D., M.D./Ph.D. or Ph.D. postdoctoral fellows for biomedical research careers in Transfusion Biology and Cellular Therapy. The program supports 8 postdoctoral fellow slots per year. Funding is provided for 2-3 years after which the fellows are expected to assume positions in academia or in pharmaceutical industry. The program has a broad scope of research activities. The scientific disciplines involved include Immunobiology, Hematopoiesis, and Cellular Therapy. During the first three funding periods, we have developed a multi- disciplinary program utilizing the strong clinical and basic research environments at Harvard Medical School. The major Harvard Medical School affiliated institutions participating in the training program include Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Leslie Silberstein will continue as the Program Director, and Drs. Hongbo (Robert) Luo and Judy Lieberman will continue as Co-Directors. Our approach of including broad representation of faculty is a fundamental strength of our program and fits well with the broad nature of Transfusion Biology and Cellular Therapies and with our overall mission to facilitate cross-fertilization of clinical, basic and translational research talent. The outstanding pool of applicants and recruitment of faculty dedicated to the program has facilitated this goal. Our faculty are not only connected through this postdoctoral training program but also through other Harvard-wide, multi-institutional programs, e.g. Harvard Stem Cell Institute, the TransLab at Boston Children's Hospital and the Dana Farber-Harvard Cancer Center.

"9609425","PROJECT SUMMARY The UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals for 2020 represents an ambitious strategy to end the AIDS epidemic. The third target envisions 90% of all patients receiving antiretroviral therapy to be virally suppressed. In 2013, WHO recommended the transition to viral load (VL) monitoring for all patients on ART for more than 6 months and at least at 12-month intervals thereafter. While VL testing is the gold standard of HIV treatment monitoring, it is not routinely available and employed in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). WHO estimates that only 20% of patients on ART were receiving VL testing in most LMICs. Nigeria, with a population of 180 million, has the second highest burden of HIV in the world. As of 2014, 747.382 Nigerians were on ART, with just under 50% coverage of those considered eligible for treatment. With only 25 VL instruments in the country, it is clear that additional VL capacity is required and we believe that at least some of this need could be rationally filled with the use of point of care (POC) VL technology. . This proposal seeks to optimize VL monitoring in response to objective 6 of this RFA. We propose a randomized control trial of the Simple Amplification-Based Assay (SAMBA) semi-quantitative (SQ) monitoring versus standard of care (SOC) VL monitoring in patients newly initiating ART. We have recently demonstrated excellent performance of the Simple Amplification-Based Assay (SAMBA) semi- quantitative (SQ) HIV-1 VL test, which has the added benefit of providing results in 90 minutes from a finger prick blood sample, in Nigeria. We hypothesize that use of a POC VL will result in increased viral suppression rates as well as improved adherence and retention rates for patients on ART. A tertiary teaching hospital in North-Central Nigeria, Jos University Teaching Hospital, and a secondary district hospital, Comprehensive Health Centre, Zamko, that currently accesses VL monitoring through a networked approach are our proposed trial sites. The specific aims of the proposed project are to:  1. Compare the 12-month outcomes of patients monitored with POC VL versus SOC VL  2. Compare the retention and adherence rates in patients monitored with POC VL versus SOC VL, with a  sub-aim of comparing drug resistant mutation patterns in patients that fail 1L ART by month 12 of treatment.  3. Determine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing POC VL monitoring The proposed trial will provide the first evaluation of a POC VL monitoring program in a relevant ART setting, the results will help inform priorities for the implementation of POC VL in Nigeria and other LMICs."
"9397730","Patient falls are the most common adverse events reported in hospitals.1-5 Each year, roughly one million patient falls occur in United States (US) hospitals resulting in over 250,000 injuries and 11,000 deaths.6 Patient falls cost hospitals due to increased lengths of stay, health care expenditures, and litigation. As of March 2015, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) Patient Safety Information System, a confidential and non-punitive reporting system, showed that falls were the most frequently reported category of patient harm across the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).7 Although it is well understood that the physical hospital environment contributes to nearly 40% of severe or fatal hospital falls,8 there are significant gaps in our knowledge about the relationship between inpatient unit design and fall rates. The few studies that have examined unit design have been conducted in a single hospital or a small number of inpatient units, limiting generalizability.9,10 Furthermore, there have been no studies focused on unit design and falls in VA medical centers (VAMCs). The VA's Office of Construction and Facilities Management promotes evidence-based design.11 Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to identify unit design factors contributing to inpatient falls within the VHA. This study addresses Strategy 6.3 of the 2014 VA Blueprint for Excellence12 and Objective 3.3 of the 2014-2020 VA Strategic Plan13 both of which emphasize design of VA space. Specifically, the Strategic Plan states that ?VA will continue capital planning efforts to provide safe, secure, modern, and sustainable infrastructure?? Our research will directly inform the VA's efforts to renovate or build physical spaces that improve Veterans' safety. To accomplish this, we are proposing a mixed methods study to explore the relationship between unit design and patient falls in VA medical/surgical (med/surg) units. We will utilize a qualitative approach to investigate staff and management perceptions with environmental factors that contribute to patient falls (Aim 1). We will use quantitative approaches in Aim 2 to identify med/surg units with higher- or lower-than expected fall rates and identify spatial and environmental factors that distinguish them. The specific aims of this study are to: Aim 1: Investigate front-line and management perceptions of and experiences with Veteran falls as they pertain to inpatient environmental factors. We will conduct walk-through interviews in 12 med/surg units at the Malcom Randall VAMC in Gainesville, the Lake City VAMC in Lake City, and the James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital in Tampa with unit and facility personnel to identify environment-related fall risk factors at each site. Interview findings will directly inform the development of an Environmental Assessment Survey to be conducted as part of Aim 2, as well as, contribute to interpretation of Aim 2 results. Aim 2: Quantify associations between unit design factors and fall rates by comparing spatial and environmental factors of units with higher- versus lower- than expected fall rates. We will use fall data from the VA Inpatient Evaluation Center (IPEC) and patient data from additional data sources to identify med/surg nursing units with higher- than expected (n = 25), and lower- than expected (n = 25), fall rates. Once these units are identified, we will measure spatial factors, analyzing computer aided design (AutoCAD) files of unit floorplans, and environmental factors, based on the Environmental Assessment Survey developed in Aim 1. Statistical tests will then be performed to identify those design factors that distinguish high and low outliers."

The micro biome will again be measured in stool samples from these children at the ages of 2 and 4 years. Relationship between the pre and postnatal factors, human milk volume and immunobiology, fecal calprotectin levels and the very early micro biome will be analyzed. The predictive power of the VLBW infant gut micro biome for determining later childhood micro biomes will be analyzed prospectively. The relationships between micro biomes across time and later growth, development and health will be determined. VLBW infants are at risk for both early and later health effects, and the role of the micro biome in these effects will be measured for the first tim in this prospective study."
"9433677","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) affects 2.4% of the population and results in more than 7,000 open heart surgeries each year in the US alone. MVP is characterized by excessive valve leaflet growth resulting in prolapse, impaired valve closure and mitral regurgitation (MR), which can cause serious complications including endocarditis and congestive heart failure. Fibrillin-1 mutations cause MVP in Marfan syndrome and Filamin A mutations cause an X-linked form of pan-valvular myxomatous dystrophy, but to date, despite a clear heritable component, no genes have been identified for non-syndromic MVP. However, we now have compelling, soon to be published data from two approaches that significantly advance our understanding of the genetics of MVP. First, we have identified mutations in Dachsous 1 (DCHS1) as a cause of MVP. DCHS1 was discovered in Drosophila and plays an important role in cell growth and polarity. Knockdown of zebrafish dchs1 resulted in atrioventricular regurgitation that could not be rescued by the mutant human protein. In vitro studies of mutant and wild type forms of human DCHS1 revealed reduced half-life of the mutant protein. Finally the haploinsufficient Dchs1 mouse displays classic MVP with altered leaflet length and thickness and functional prolapse. These results confirm a role for DCHS1 in mitral valve disease. Second, we recently completed a genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify common genetic variants associated with MVP. Using a population of 2,854 cases we identified 6 novel genetic loci that reached genome wide significance and replicated in independent cohorts. In order to identify causal genes we knocked down candidate genes from three loci in zebrafish, identifying two genes that cause a valve phenotype: Tensin 1, (TNS1) an integrin and actin filament binding protein, and LIM and cysteine-rich domains 1 (LMCD1), which augments calcineurin/NFAT signaling. These genes are excellent functional candidates for MVP. Our exciting preliminary data set the stage for mechanistic investigation into the pathogenesis of MVP. Our hypothesis is that the newly identified genes regulate cell migration during development which, when perturbed, results in MVP. Specifically, we aim to: 1.Expand the network of MVP genes by: a. evaluating the remaining GWAS loci, b. performing comprehensive protein interaction studies using affinity proteomics, and c. explore the role of the MVP gene network in regulating cellular migration, 2. Investigate the mechanism of valve dysfunction in Tns1 knockout mice, and 3. Determine the burden of mutations in MVP genes by performing DNA capture and sequencing in a large case-control cohort. Mitral valve prolapse is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. There are currently no treatments short of surgery, in part because the pathogenesis is poorly understood. Given these challenges, we believe that our work on the newly discovered MVP genes will facilitate a greater understanding of MVP and may ultimately provide novel targets for prevention and treatment of this common and clinically important disease."
"9652504","Project Summary/Abstract Findings from several studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) suggest that adults in the region have higher prevalence of depression than their counterparts in many middle- and high-income countries. The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that mental and substance use disorders account for 19% of disability years in sub-Saharan Africa and the South African Stress and Health study ? conducted in 2003-2004 as part of the World Health Organization's World Mental Health Survey Initiative ? found a lifetime and 12- month prevalence of mental disorders of 30.3% and 16.5%, respectively. Despite the high prevalence, however, little is known about the determinants as well as the dynamics of mental health outcomes in the region. Prior research in SSA has largely relied on a few cross-sectional datasets and focused on the association between mental health and a limited set of demographic characteristics. While studies outside SSA have utilized longitudinal data to examine how economic crises, natural disasters, and other stressful life events (SLEs) influence mental health outcomes, there has been little to no research on such effects in SSA despite the twin significance of disease- and accident-related mortality and mental disorders in the region. The proposed project will fill this important gap by utilizing data from the first nationally representative longitudinal survey of the South African population, the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS). The NIDS data span a 7- year period (2008-2015), contain detailed information on mortality and other SLEs within households, and include measures of depressive symptoms for all adult household members. Aim 1 of the project is to explore and assess trends in mental health in South Africa over a 7-year period, including transitions into or out of poor mental health and the role of individual, household, and community factors in explaining these transitions. Aim 2 of the project is to determine patterns in depression before and after the mortality of a household member as well as other positive and negative events occurring in the household. Analyses will use panel data regression techniques including models with individual fixed effects and time trends. The project will ultimately enhance our understanding of how mortality is influencing mental health outcomes in South Africa and help determine the level of need for mental health services as well as ways to improve the targeted provision of such services."
"9503500","Electrical signals recorded from neurons by intracortical electrodes have been used by human patients to communicate with computers and to control robotic limbs. The signal quality and longevity of recordable signals are inconsistent. There is increasing evidence indicating that the neuro-inflammatory response may be a primary hurdle to consistently obtaining high quality recordings. Within the brain, cells are living in the elastic extracellular matrix (ECM) meshwork with 3D and high aspect ratio fibrillary protein structures. This environment is textured and compliant, not smooth or stiff. In contrast, to the currently accepted and used surfaces of intracortical microelectrodes. The discontinuity between the architecture and stiffness of the tissue and device results in the initial inflammatory and chronic foreign body response to the implant. Current research aimed at alleviating the inflammatory response, as well as improving the neuronal signal from electrodes, focuses on either therapeutic or materials-based solutions. Limited emphasis has been placed on combinatorial approaches that mimic the physical properties of the native ECM, including the architecture and stiffness.  The current proposal seeks to progress the training of Dr. Ereifej where the CDA-1 training left off, ensuring continuity. The candidates CDA-1 preliminary work has successfully etched surface modifications based on the architecture (but not orientation) of native brain tissue onto non-functional silicon Michigan style shanks. It was shown that implants etched with nanoscale surface modifications were able to decrease glial cell activation and increase neuronal viability around the implant site over time. However, Dr. Ereifej has yet to: 1) characterize the long-term effects or 2) evaluate various orientations of lines, to determine the optimal surface modifications. Given the documented role that substrate stiffness has on cellular response to materials, it is also imperative to evaluate the configurations on materials with a modulus similar to brain tissue. Therefore, the central hypothesis to this proposal is that microelectrodes that more closely mimic the architecture and modulus of native brain tissue will result in improved biocompatibility, displayed through a reduced chronic inflammatory response, improved long-term recording stability, and decreased motor deficits.  We propose to first characterize the neuroinflammatory, electrophysiological and motor behavior response evoked by chronic implantation of intracortical microelectrodes etched with surface modifications. This aim will test the hypothesis that microelectrodes etched with surface modifications mimicking that of the native environment will result in a reduced neuroinflammatory response of the surrounding tissue, improved stability of recorded neuronal signals and result in less motor deficits compared to control animals. Specific Aim 1 will utilize the neural implants with the bio-inspired surface architectures developed during the CDA-1 phase and therefore are available for immediate testing in vivo. Next, we will characterize the combined effects topographically- modified substrates displaying both bio-mimetic architecture and modulus. Here we will test the hypothesis that combination of topographical-modified substrates displaying both bio-mimetic architecture and modulus will result in a reduced inflammatory response compared to either modifications in isolation or control. Functional microelectrodes are not yet developed with all possible combinations of both architecture and modulus. Thus, SA2 will begin with modified PDMS and silicon substrates, and all testing will be completed in vitro. Together, SA1 and SA2 will provide the critical foundation to begin to explore the central hypothesis for this award. Most importantly, the CDA-2 mechanism will be utilized as designed, to provide a platform to establish a niche for Dr. Ereifej?s future independent research program. A Merit Review application is anticipated to be submitted to advance the findings from this CDA-2. This research is integrated with Evon Ereifej?s career development plan with the goal of training to become a leading investigator, studying nervous system diseases, injuries, and disorders to find therapeutic and medical device treatments to aid in the wellbeing and longevity of patients? lives."
