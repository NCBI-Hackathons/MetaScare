"9504845","Project Summary/Abstract  An overarching goal of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTS) is to improve skill acquisition (i.e. the ability to successfully perform a skill learned in treatment) and skill utilization (i.e. the frequency with which a patient practices or employs therapeutic skills). However, many patients receiving CBT fail to achieve sufficient rates of skill utilization or adequate skill acquisition and treatment outcomes suffer as a result. Augmentations to CBT that improve skill utilization and acquisition could result in substantial improvements in treatment outcome for a variety of mental health disorders. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) are a promising method for improving skill utilization and acquisition in CBT. EMIs provide assistance when and where individuals are most in need (typically through smartphone applications). Smartphone-based EMI systems now have the capability to deliver interventions at the precise moment when these interventions are most needed using algorithm-based context-aware systems. An EMI system designed to increase skill utilization and acquisition could 1) detect when a patient should practice using a therapeutic skill and 2) provide a tailored interventions designed to facilitate skill use at the time when receiving an intervention would be most impactful. Despite the increased development and widespread use of both smartphone app technologies and EMI systems, there currently exists limited data to suggest whether smartphone-based EMI systems can successfully improve skill acquisition and utilization when used as an adjunct to in-person CBT.  Patients with bulimia nervosa (BN), a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating and purging imposed on top of an otherwise highly restrictive diet, may represent an ideal group to test the utility of a skills-based EMI system. We chose to augment CBT for BN for three reasons: (1) Symptom improvement in CBT for BN can be explained by improvements in a relatively small number of concrete and measureable therapeutic skills, (2) acquisition and utilization of these skills is often poor in CBT for BN and poor skill acquisition and utilization is strongly related to treatment failure, and (3) the barriers to skill acquisition and utilization in CBT for BN are likely addressable by EMI augmentation. In the current study, we propose to develop, refine, and test an EMI system (CBT+) that will use data collected from standard CBT for BN electronic self-monitoring forms to identify when patients should use CBT skills. In Phase 1, we will develop CBT+ (based on prior EMI-systems developed by our team) and will use an iterative development approach (n=10) to ensure CBT+ achieves acceptable target engagement. Using a single-case ABAB design (A= EMI on, B= EMI off), we will evaluate the ability of CBT+ to 1) increase utilization of six core skills in CBT for BN during ?EMI on? phases and 2) produce more rapid gains in skill acquisition during ?EMI on? phases. In Phase 2, we will complete a pilot RCT (n=45) comparing standard CBT for BN (n=15) to CBT for BN augmented with CBT+ (n=30) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of CBT+ and evaluate target engagement and validation."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks NIH support for enhancements of Tulane University's existing capstone Biomedical Engineering Team Design course to enable its students to engage in medical technology design projects addressing clinical needs. Students will work in teams on open-ended biomedical design projects formulated by the students themselves-originating from their identification of clinical needs & market opportunities during a new summer clinical immersion, and guided by subsequent analyses of regulatory & reimbursement landscapes and other considerations. The enhanced course will emphasize advanced prototyping and sound intellectual property strategy to position the teams for successful commercialization of their projects. Design thinking (aka Human Centered Design) will be a running theme and unifying element across activities of the enhanced course. Special topics such as lean design and design for manufacture and assembly (DFMA) will be introduced at appropriate stages in the design process. The enhanced course will cross-link with other courses & programs to improve student communication skills and increase student awareness of & ability to engage in life-long learning. The academic-year-long course will culminate in the filing of provisional patents to protect student intellectual property, and a publc show constituting a design competition with commercial pitch to potential investors. These enhancements will prepare students for careers in medicine and health-related engineering practice- and will support the design and development of medical technology to benefit society."
"9474238","There is no question that the vulnerabilities of the developing brain and the potential for recovery are unique, or that pediatric mild traumatic brain injury (pmTBI) represents a major public health concern with ?400,000 new cases annually. Although the neurobehavioral symptoms of pmTBI are well-documented in the first days to weeks post-injury, few well-designed studies have examined the long-term consequences of injury. Even less is known about the neuropathology underlying the expression of post-concussive symptoms (PCS) and the impact on clinical outcomes. Thus, clinicians currently do not understand how children typically recover in the first year of injury from either a clinical or neurophysiologic perspective. The current application addresses this critical knowledge gap by collecting longitudinal (1 week, 4 months and 1 year post-injury) neuroimaging and clinical data on a large cohort of pmTBI patients (N = 150) and healthy controls (N = 125). Our preliminary data suggests diffuse white matter injuries, hemodynamic abnormalities in deep gray matter, and signs of cortical atrophy at 4 months post-injury in a relatively small sample. Consistent with animal models, these data indicate that multiple imaging measures at multiple time-points are needed to understand the dynamic effects of pmTBI on neurophysiology and underlying contributory factors (e.g., cerebral blood flow, cerebral vascular reactivity). The current study will extend these findings to the early chronic and chronic injury stages, determine how these diffuse injuries relate to clinical outcomes, and determine the individual ?recovery time-courses? of selected biomarkers. Ratings of PCS are collected from both child and parent in conjunction with computerized cognitive testing, quality of life measures, and assessments of pre-morbid functioning. A multi-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging sequence provides unique information on potential underlying mechanisms of action (water fractions). Functional activity is measured during a spatial attention task and through connectivity analyses. Additional quantitative measurements of resting cerebral blood flow and cerebral vascular reactivity will disambiguate hemodynamic from neuronal dysfunction. These independent measures will also provide critical information on how the vasculature in deep gray matter structures is affected by trauma, providing mechanisms of target engagement for future therapeutic trials. Growth curve modeling provides preliminary analyses of different recovery trajectories (fully versus partially recovered) for both clinical and imaging data. The public health significance of the current application is multifold. First, late childhood and adolescence constitutes a critical time for brain development, and persistent neurobehavioral symptoms following pmTBI can interfere with subsequent academic achievements and interpersonal relationships for years post-injury. Second, developing objective biomarkers that track injury progression will aid in diagnosis of injury severity and provide an empirical foundation for determining when it is truly safe for children to return to learn/physical activity. Finally, understanding the mechanisms of injury represents a critical first step for developing novel therapies that target neuropathology (i.e. target engagement) rather than symptom mitigation, the current approach for all pmTBI therapies."
"9462744","OUTREACH, RECRUITMENT, AND EDUCATION CORE (CORE E) - PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the Outreach, Recruitment and Education (ORE) Core is to improve the care provided to persons and families affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias by disseminating information and translating new knowledge into practice for researchers, health care professionals, trainees and the general public. The activities of the ORE Core represent a collaborative initiative involving the Section of Geriatrics and Gerontology, the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Association Chapter Network (WAACN), Office of Continuing Professional Development in Medicine and Public Health (OCPD), Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), State of Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS), Wisconsin Geriatric Education Center (WGEC), communities throughout Wisconsin and the extensive outreach, community education and dementia diagnostic clinic programs of the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Institute (WAI). These collaborations represent a unique leveraging of resources to expand the influence of the ORE Core beyond the walls of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (UW SMPH). The ORE Core is fully integrated into the Clinical, Neuropathology, and Data Management and Statistical Cores as well as the Minority Recruitment Satellite Program (MRSP). Working together, the Core has been able to identify and resolve the barriers to research participation by a diverse study population. Our successful recruitment efforts are matched by our clinical and research education and training programs and the statewide outreach and professional education programs of the WAI. Over the past 4 years, the Core's outreach, recruitment and education programs have worked to achieve the stated goals of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) by enhancing public awareness and engagement, optimizing care quality and efficiency and working with health providers and state government to expand supports for persons with AD and their families. The Core has made major contributions to NAPA's primary goal to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025 by supporting clinical trials and the study of preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD at the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) and the WAI (Wisconsin Registry of Alzheimer's Prevention: Biomarkers of Preclinical AD, RO1AG27161-5) [2-4]. These efforst and collaborations will be expanded during this renewal and new programs will be added to ensure ongoing success of the ORE Core."
"9462729","PROJECT THREE SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The central theme of the MADRC is to examine the earliest features of the Alzheimer disease process. In keeping with this theme, the Center aims to understand dysfunction in neural systems prior to overt clinical symptoms - using novel clinical assays, advanced neuroimaging, and neuropathological studies focused on amyloid positive, cognitively intact individuals. Animal models would be an additional important approach to these early phases of disease where there is a gap in our knowledge; unfortunately, although animal models develop amyloid plaques and/or neurofibrillary tangles and reliably reproduce the molecular pathology of AD, they do not reproduce the unique patterns of anatomical changes that occur in early AD. Thus, no current animal models of AD provide a platform to study the anatomically restricted pathological changes that are known to occur in human patients. To address this problem, therefore, we have generated a transgenic mouse line (rTauEC) that over-expresses human mutant P301L tau primarily in the medial entorhinal cortex and develops tangles in those neurons in a pattern that is reminiscent of the early Braak II stage of human AD. We will examine the natural history of this model, examining the temporal relationship of tangles, synapse loss, and neuronal loss, to get at chicken-and-egg issues not possible to disambiguate in human autopsy tissue. We will use behavioral paradigms and molecular markers of neural system activation to test hypotheses about functional deafferentation of neural systems at early time points, before onset of behavioral abnormalities. Entorhinal neurons in rTauEC mice develop aberrant tau-filled axons and altered axonal projections, ultimately losing synaptic terminals in the dentate gyrus. This model also has the attribute of developing tau inclusions in the neurons that are the target of the entorhinal projection, in the dentate gyrus, despite not expressing human tau mRNA in those neurons. This has been interpreted as supporting the idea that there is a trans-synaptic propagation of pathological tau. We have crossed the rTauEC mice with APP/PS1 overexpressors to develop a model of tangles in entorhinal cortex and plaques throughout the cortex, analogous to the human pathology of many early cases of AD changes. Surprisingly, the addition of plaques seems to robustly accelerate the tangle propagation phenotype and also exacerbate the axonal dystrophies, developing more severe neuritic lesions in the hippocampus. Tau overexpression can be regulated with doxycycline in the rTau EC mice, mimicking some forms of anti-tau therapies. This model will therefore allow us to dissect a detailed time course of neural system degeneration, test hypotheses about tau-amyloid interactions in a defined neural system, and examine the consequences of reducing tau at various points in the disease process. Together these experiments will help provide insight into the pathobiology of the earliest phases of AD as well as highlight potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention early in the disease."
"9551501","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Approximately 20% of the 2 million troops deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan may require treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Bipolar disorder, a sequel to PTSD is common among Veterans. Currently about 30% of the bipolar Veterans receive chronic lithium (Li) therapy, which also effectively prevents suicidal tendencies. However, chronic usage of lithium is limited by the development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a condition in which the kidneys cannot concentrate urine resulting in excessive loss of water and electrolytes. Currently used modalities for the treatment of NDI are encountered with varying degrees of success as well as side effects. Refinement and/or replacement of the current side effect-prone therapies with new drugs based on an improved understanding of molecular pathophysiology of Li-induced NDI should result in improved efficacy and fewer side effects. In this context, we discovered that a signaling system, called purinergic signaling, can be targeted to ameliorate Li-induced NDI. The goal of this project is to decipher the role of ADP-activated P2Y12 receptor (R) in Li- induced NDI. This will have significant impact on our current knowledge of pathophysiology of Li-induced NDI, with a potential for the development of novel therapies. We observed that P2Y12-R is expressed in the kidney, and its selective blockade by clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix(r)), a widely used anti-clotting drug, increases the ability of the kidney to conserve water, and ameliorates Li-induced NDI. Based on these novel observations, we hypothesize that blockade of P2Y12-R ameliorates Li-induced NDI by re- sensitizing the kidney collecting duct to the action of AVP. We further hypothesize that P2Y12-R blockade suppresses Li-induced increases in prostanoid and nitric oxide production, and oxidative stress, thus contributing to overall beneficial effect. To address this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims, and use rat and mouse models, cultured kidney collecting duct cells, and agents that modulate signaling through for P2Y12R. Aim # 1 is to investigate the effect of P2Y12-R on Li-induced decrease in APQ2 expression in the collecting duct and the potential mechanisms involved in it. Aim # 2 is to investigate the beneficial effects of P2Y12-R blockade on Li-induced increases in prostanoid and nitric oxide production and oxidative stress. Aim # 3 is to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of targeting P2Y12-R (with or without concurrent blunting of P2Y2-R) on Li-induced NDI, collecting duct remodeling and cell proliferation in the kidney. Thus, this proposal is based on a novel concept, observations, and hypothesis, and it shifts the current focus of research and therapies for Li-induced NDI from predominantly the ones that counter anti- AVP effects to the ones that enhance the sensitivity of the kidney to AVP, thereby ensuing minimal side effects."
"9471404","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of underrepresented minorities (URM) receiving graduate training in the biological and physical sciences continues to be small despite increases in the total population. Major obstacles for URMs applying to and being admitted to graduate programs in the biomedical sciences include limited research experience, limited advanced courses in the biological sciences, unfamiliarity with the application process, unawareness of career opportunities for PhD's, and lower scores on standardized tests (e.g., GRE's). Recognizing these issues and the need to increase the diversity of its own doctoral programs and faculty as well as the field as a whole, Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences initiated a formal post-baccalaureate pilot program in the life sciences called the Research Scholar Initiative. This proposal seeks to expand this program by establishing a Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP Scholars Program). The program will provide a 1-2 year research and educational training opportunity for individuals interested in pursuing PhD's/ScD's in either the traditional lab-based biomedical sciences (referred to as Life Sciences) or non-lab based biomedical sciences (referred to as Population Health Sciences). The goals are to 1) provide a personalized research education and training opportunity for 10 scholars/yr; 2) have at least 90% complete at least one year of research training; and 3) have a minimum of 75% apply to and be admitted to top doctoral (PhD or ScD) or in some cases, MD/PhD programs in the biomedical sciences. In addition, by providing early exposure of the trainees in the Life Sciences and Population Health Sciences to the disciplines of the other, we hope to enable them to better understand research in each other's areas and plant the seeds of interdisciplinary collaborations in their future research programs. Goals will be achieved by 1) PREP Scholars doing independent research with faculty in the Life and Population Health Sciences for one year and possibly two years; 2) developing a personalized program to enhance academic preparation (e.g., quantitative methods, cell biology, computing, etc.); 3) Establishing an advisory committee for each scholar to expand their mentoring network; 4) Having Scholars participate in program-specific courses and workshops designed to build skills critical for graduate school success; 5) Engaging them in research discussions that will expose PREP Scholars to Population Health and Life Sciences research; 6) Familiarize scholars with graduate training environment by providing opportunities to interact with current students and faculty in our program and other programs in the area."
"9462138","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past decade, we have made major strides towards determining the pathogenesis and testing a treatment for Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). We successfully expressed the wild-type human NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit 4 (ND4) of complex I in the nuclear genetic code. The protein was imported into the mitochondria by agency of a mitochondrial targeting sequence. The gene was packaged into next generation tyrosine to phenylalanine modified self-complementary adenoassociated virus (AAV) then injected into rodent eyes. FLAG-tagged wild-type human ND4 was detected quickly in most inner retinal neurons by 1 day post injection and it integrated into Complex I. Furthermore, in rodent eyes also injected with a mutant Gl 1778A ND4 homologue responsible for most cases of LHON, wild-type ND4 restored defective ATP synthesis, suppressed visual loss, reduced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells and prevented demise of axons in the optic nerve that persisted long-term. The self-complementary wild-type ND4 injected at the relevant titer into the ex vivo human eye expressed in most retinal ganglion cells, suggesting that it will do so in our LHON patients. Primates vitreally injected with untagge ND4 had no adverse reactions, suggesting that this vector should be a safe and effective platform for clinical testing in LHON. Our goal in this application is to test the safety of AAV-mediated delivery of the human ND4 gene in a Phase I clinical trial of patients with mutated G11778A mtDNA and then move to a Phase II study to prove efficacy in the later years of this program. Phase I will consist of an open-label, unilateral, single-dose intravitreal injection of AAV-ND4 per patient in the worse eye in a dose-escalation study investigating the safety of three vector doses (5x10e9 vg, 2.46x10e10 vg and 1xlOel1 vg) in a small number of patients with molecularly confirmed Gl 1778A-mutated mitochondrial DNA who have chronic bilateral, severe visual loss for more than 1 year (Aim 1) or acute bilateral several visual loss for less tha 1 year (Aim 2), and then, lastly, in the eye with better vision but that we know is predestined to lose significant vision within 6 months from the onset of visual loss in the first eye (Aim 3)."
"9471459","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal requesting support for the pathogen free, pedigreed and genomically characterized Vervet Research Colony (VRC). For the past five years the VRC has responded vigorously to an increased demand for VRC resources, including the distribution of 404 animals to the national research community and more than 100 in just the prior year. Future demand is projected to be strong owing to increased use of vervets for vaccine development, cardiometabolic disorders, and dementia studies, and because of substantial difficulties surrounding the international transportation of monkeys for research, including those from the Caribbean. The genomic sequencing of all individuals in the VRC and the resulting genomic resources now provides investigators the opportunity to apply modern systems biology to the study of disease pathobiology and to the development of new therapies and interventions for the chronic, degenerative, and infectious disorders posing the greatest risks to public health. The development of the genomic resource and updating of the pedigree continues to involve a strong collaboration with investigators from UCLA, who have partnered with Wake Forest scientists for more than a decade. As a national, multicategorical research resource, the VRC provides access to well-characterized monkeys for research on- or off site, including investigations focused on the nutritional context. The three specific aims for the VRC for the next grant period are: 1) to ensure both a minimum of 85 pathogen-free, genomically characterized vervets to the national biomedical community and the accompanying data and tissue repositories required to facilitate the systematic study of human disease and therapies; 2) to enhance the VRC's translational value by developing data and tissue repositories from controlled, repeated assessments while consuming a `Western' vs. usual laboratory chow diet, thereby providing a relevant nutritional context for understanding chronic disease risk and facilitating `omic' approaches to the study of animals across the lifespan; and 3) to continue providing the VRC as a platform for training veterinarians and other professionals in biomedical research, husbandry, clinical care, and the management of animal resources. It is important to note that the data and tissue repositories are enriched by regular collection and assay of blood, muscle, fat, and CSF; other collections, including liver, bone, and multimodal imaging (PET, MRI, CT, DXA, MEG) are available on request. To encourage maximum use of the resource and associated repositories, the VRC investigators engage in a program of scientific outreach that includes an annual national symposium, a pilot study program, a website, and a regular newsletter. The funds supporting scientific outreach are provided entirely by the Wake Forest School of Medicine. The VRC also engages in community outreach, focused largely on students in grades 4 - 12 and their teachers."
"9460365","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Being first reported in 2001, store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a relatively new phenomenon in skeletal muscle. SOCE is coordinated by coupling between two proteins: STIM1 calcium sensors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and Ca2+-permeable Orai1 channels in the transverse tubule (TT) membrane. SOCE enhances muscle growth/development, limits fatigue, and promotes fatigue-resistant type I fiber specification. On the other hand, SOCE dysfunction contributes to muscle weakness/fatigue in aging, exacerbates muscular dystrophy, and mutations in STIM1 and Orai1 genes result in debilitating myopathies. The picture that emerges is that tight regulation of STIM1/Orai1-dependent SOCE activity is critical for optimal muscle performance such that increases or decreases in SOCE activity can lead to muscle fatigue, sarcopenia, and myopathy. While SOCE activity clearly impacts muscle performance, sites of STIM1-Orai1 coupling in muscle remain unclear. For this renewal, we developed inducible, muscle-specific Orai1 and STIM1 KO mice to determine the mechanism by which STIM1-Orai1 coupling limits fatigue. We provide exciting evidence that fatiguing exercise drives the formation of heretofore undescribed junctions between the TT and SR where STIM1-Orai1 coupling occurs, which we refer to as Ca2+ entry units (CEUs). CEUs are connected to, but distinct from, the triad or Ca2+ release unit. We provide preliminary data that Orai1 has a stronger impact on muscle fiber contractile function in female compared to male mice. We also provide preliminary collaborative immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy feasibility data for characterizing the STIM1 proteome before and after CEU formation. We will use these research tools, approaches, discoveries, and collaborations to advance understanding of the molecular determinants, subcellular location, and functional role of SOCE in skeletal muscle. Based on our published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that fatiguing exercise triggers formation of junctional extensions of the triad containing activated STIM1-Orai1 complexes that coordinate SOCE to enhance SR calcium refilling, limit muscle fatigue, and over the long-term, promote NFATc1 nuclear localization and type I fiber specification. We also hypothesize that fatigue-induced CEU formation in muscle involves a complex coordination of multiple protein components (including Bin1, STIM1, and Orai1). We propose to test these hypotheses according to the following two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will characterize the role of Orai1 in muscle fatigue and Type I fiber specification. Aim 2 will identif the subcellular location, molecular components, and stability of newly identified CEUs in adult skeletal muscle and determine the dependence of CEU formation and disassembly on the development of and recovery from fatigue. This project will: 1) provide novel mechanistic insights into the physiological role and subcellular location of SOCE in muscle, 2) use targeted and non-biased discovery approaches to identify and validate proteins involved CEU formation, and 3) determine the impact of gender on Orai1-dependent SOCE function, fatigue, fiber type specification, and CEU formation."
"9463551","Project Summary Antithrombin (AT) is a major serpin inhibitor in plasma that regulates the proteolytic activity of coagulation proteases of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. In addition to its anticoagulant function, AT also has a potent antiinflammatory function. The anticoagulant function of AT is mediated through its reactive center loop (RCL)-dependent inhibition of coagulation proteases, but the antiinflammatory signaling function of AT is mediated via its D-helix-dependent interaction with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, attached to core proteins of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Unlike the relatively well-understood anticoagulant function, the mechanism of the antiinflammatory function of AT is poorly understood. Moreover, because it is thought that a conformational change in the RCL of AT by D-helix-dependent interaction with vascular GAGs is required for the protease inhibitory function of the serpin, the contribution of the AT D-helix-GAG interaction to the physiological function of the serpin in two pathways remains unknown. The antiinflammatory function of AT requires its D- helix dependent interaction with 3-O-sulfate (3-OS) containing GAGs, the same type of vascular GAGs which are thought to be required for the conformational activation of AT in order for the serpin to optimally inhibit the activity of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteases. The Syndecan-4 (Synd-4) sub-family of HSPGs has been identified as the primary receptor on which AT binds to elicit antiinflammatory responses in vascular endothelial cells. However, Synd-4 is also an essential co- receptor for receptor tyrosine kinases for signaling by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2 also called bFGF) in vascular endothelial cells. The mechanism by which AT and FGF2 utilize the same receptor to elicit paradoxical signaling responses is completely unknown. We have prepared several AT and receptor mutants and propose to investigate these questions, employing both cellular and animal models in 2 Specific Aims. We propose to investigate 1) the significance of AT D-helix interaction with vascular HSPGs to the physiological function of the serpin, in the alternative anticoagulant and antiinflammatory pathways by employing AT-deficient mice and 2) the mechanism by which AT elicits intracellular signaling responses in vascular endothelial cells. A sub-aim of Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism by which cleaved and/or latent AT elicit antiangiogenic responses in endothelial cells in response to FGF2. These studies will utilize multidisciplinary approaches including genetics, basic biochemistry, kinetics, cellular and molecular biology methods to provide key information related to the D-helix dependent antiinflammatory signaling mechanism of AT."
"9456537","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to suffer a pregnancy-related death than are white women. The maternal mortality ratio-the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births-in the U.S. is high compared to other countries. In New York City the maternal mortality ratio has been above the national average for 40 years and currently ranks among the highest in the US. Racial/ethnic disparities in New York City are more alarming as black women are 7 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women. Potentially fatal complications of pregnancy include hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and cardiomyopathy and black women suffer greater mortality from all of them. Deaths associated with pregnancy in the United States are the tip of the iceberg; for every maternal death, 100 women experience severe maternal morbidity-potentially life-threatening diagnosis or receipt of a life-saving procedure. Severe maternal morbidity affects approximately 52,000 women annually in the US. Similar to racial/ethnic disparities in maternal mortality, black women are much more likely to suffer from severe maternal morbidity than white women. Since a significant proportion of maternal mortality and morbidity is considered preventable, quality of health care delivered in hospitals may represent a major lever for improving outcomes. We propose a mixed methods study to investigate the extent to which improving hospital quality could reduce racial/ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity. The objectives of this study are to: 1) Rank New York City hospitals by risk-adjusted severe maternal morbidity and examine disparities in the distribution of white, black, and Latino deliveries among these hospitals; 2) Use mixed methods to explore processes of care, unit characteristics, organizational factors, and patient factors associated with high and low rates of severe maternal morbidity hospitals; 3) Explore patients' perspectives on barriers to receipt of high quality care including their decision- making regarding delivery hospital, and perception of risk; and 4) Disseminate findings among key community and hospital stakeholders who have the power to promote uptake of the best practices and address the patient concerns. In the final phase of this project, we will bring leaders of obstetrics, NYC and State Department of Health officials, The Joint Commission, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, hospital quality leaders, community leaders, and mothers to discuss our results. We will explore interventions to improve care for women in NYC and narrow racial/ethnic maternal morbidity disparities and develop patient- centered strategies to reduce barriers to receipt of high quality care. This study aims to produce knowledge about organizational factors and processes of care that are of high relevance for the provision of quality inpatient maternity care; this information will be specifically tailored to units serving minority populations and applicable to other areas i the U.S. where racial/ethnic disparities exist between hospitals."

The need for novel therapeutics that are specifically approved for pediatric AKI/RRT use is driven by the nearly 50% mortality rates of pediatric patients with this disorder.  The SCD is a novel device containing bundled biomimetic polysulfone fibers which selectively bind/sequester and deactivate leukocytes (LE) in a dialysis extracorporeal blood circuit, resulting in an immunomodulatory effect in the systemic inflammatory response associated with AKI and SSAKI.  The SCD, combined with regional citrate anticoagulation, is a novel therapeutic application utilizing biocompatible membranes that allow LE attachment in a calcium low environment during regional citrate anticoagulation resulting in a diminution in the LE activated state. The SCD has been studied in prior clinical trials of AKI.          This proposal will study the safety and efficacy of SCD therapy in pediatric patients with AKI requiring CRRT therapy. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate this innovative approach in pediatric ICU patients of greater than 20 kilograms (kg) in body weight.  Specific Aim 2 will assess this approach in pediatric patients with body weights between 8 and 20 kg utilizing a SCD one-fifth the size of the current SCD."
"9447229","Project Summary. Loss of endothelial barrier integrity is central to pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe lung disease, associated with sepsis and trauma. Thus, homeostatic replenishment of ECs after injury is required for the efficient formation of a stable endothelial barrier and to prevent long-lasting lung vascular injury but the identity and source of these ?reparative endothelial cells (ECs)? remains unclear. Given the findings that ECs can convert into fibroblast-like cells (FLC) upon tissue injury and that forced expression of the ETS family of transcription factors (e.g., ETV2) reprogram FLC into ECs, a fundamental unanswered question is whether a shift from the ?reparative? EC lineage into a non-reparative FLC lineage impairs endothelial regeneration and thereby recovery from lung vascular injury. PTEN (Phosphatase and TENsin homolog) is a well-known tumor suppressor and regulates key features of vascularization such as endothelial migration and proliferation. Our Preliminary Data, showed that EC-specific conditional deletion of PTEN markedly decreased lung EC regeneration while FLCs were increased and these mice developed lung edema spontaneously. Further experiments showed that PTEN localized to the nucleus of ECs and maintained the expression of endothelial transcription factor, Ets-Related Gene (ERG). Based on these intriguing Preliminary Data, and using a range of powerful approaches such as novel genetic mouse models (inducible dual-reporter EC-PTEN and EC-ERG null mice for lineage tracing), RNAseq and measurements of lung vascular permeability we will investigate the hypothesis that PTEN-induced ERG pathway is a key determinant of the EC lineage and resolution of lung-fluid balance. Our Specific Aims are: #1: to investigate the hypothesis that EC-expressed PTEN drives endothelial cell regeneration at the expense of fibroblast-like cells and thereby maintains the lung vascular barrier; #2: to determine (a) the role of the endothelial transcription factor, ERG, as an effector of PTEN and a key determinant of EC lineage, and (b) to identify ERG enriched endothelial cells through endothelial lineage tracing as intrinsic reparative ECs whose activation promotes lung vascular regeneration and restoration of lung fluid balance. With these comprehensive studies, we will identify for the first time the role of the PTEN-ERG cascade in maintaining the reparative EC lineage and in resolving inflammatory lung vascular injury. We expect our studies to lay a new conceptual framework for the development of novel therapeutic approaches exploiting PTEN as a key target for the treatment of ARDS."
"9462746","NEUROIMAGING CORE (CORE G)- PROJECT SUMMARY A major focus of the Wisconsin ADRC research agenda is multi-disciplinary translational neuroscience research in humans with evidence of AD or with risk factors. In-vivo neuroimaging assessments and sophisticated analytic techniques are increasingly being utilized or sought by our investigators to gain further insights about the neurobiology of AD. Thus, a NeuroImaging Core, constituting an MRI service, PET service and Data Informatics and Analysis service is proposed whose purpose will be to provide necessary infrastructure and resources for investigators to successfully implement imaging outcomes in an efficient manner. This will reduce duplication of effort and resources, while at the same time maximizing the possibilities of collaboration and the leveraging of data across ADRC affiliated projects through standardization of a select subset of core scan sequences. Over the prior funding period we developed a highly successful imaging service within the Neuropathology and Biomarkers Core (Core D) with extensive utilization and growth that exceeded projections resulting in support for 41 funded projects, the majority were funded federally. This occurred largely by emphasizing support of new faculty and faculty who were not imaging experts per se, but nevertheless desired to enhance the significance and impact of their studies by incorporating state of the art imaging outcomes. The breadth and depth of Wisconsin ADRC supported and pending/planned imaging projects warrant more comprehensive infrastructure and service delivery to improve our ability to collaborate and enhance the scientific mission and impact of the Wisconsin ADRC. The Specific Aims of the Core are: Aim 1. Primary ADRC support) To provide imaging support for the ADRC cohorts (MRI) and support the MRI and amyloid imaging needs in Project 2. This includes support for data acquisition, data management, pipeline programming for image preprocessing, and data analysis. All newly enrolled ADRC participants are asked to have an MRI at baseline. All IMPACT and MCI participants will be invited to have a follow-up MRI scan every two years in conjunction with their regular ADRC visit; these cohorts were selected for repeat imaging because of their high local programmatic scientific value to many of our projects. Approximately 1170 MRI scans are projected for the ADRC alone. Aim 2) To provide imaging informatics support for all ADRC-affiliated projects including tools for cataloging and interacting with imaging data in a project specific manner. We will use these tools to continue to actively manage the many ADRC-affiliated neuroimaging projects that use our infrastructure. This includes management of the existing repository of 2300 MRI exams and 520 PET exams spanning 39+ projects, as well as an expected 3000 additional imaging exams during the renewal funding period. Aim 3: Methodology infrastructure: To make available the latest advanced PET and MRI imaging methods and data analysis capabilities in support of ADRC affiliated projects. We will assist projects obtain regular high quality data acquisition, continue to develop and deploy pipelines for preprocessing and also assist with the project-specific image analysis as needed. As new developments in imaging and analysis develop we will integrate these into our repertoire. The core will optimize imaging protocols, implement quality improvement processes, and evolve our pipelines to accommodate new approaches and sequences. Aim 4) Consultation and Training: Provide training to investigators and staff in the ADRC and University of Wisconsin-Madison campus at large on neuroimaging methods and analysis techniques pertaining to neuro- disorders. This includes regular seminars and formal courses as well as individual and small group instruction. We will also provide pre- and post-award consultation to investigators who are implementing/planning imaging studies, and assist in grant preparation, study design, and startup."

"9512284","PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team to execute an integrated mechanistic and translational program to defining neoantigen biology in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Despite advances in multimodality treatment, a significant number of HNSCC patients suffer from recurrences and distant metastasis. With recent advances in genomics driven oncology and immunotherapeutics, the outcomes for afflicted HNSCC patients are likely to dramatically improve. However, there is an essential need for a better understanding of HNSCC neoantigen biology as these tumor specific antigens are the final common targets for immunotherapy. To address this key issue in immunotherapeutics, the work we propose will directly address the NIDCR RFA on ?Neoantigen-Based Therapeutic Targeting of Head and Neck Cancers? by completing coupled mechanistic and translational studies. Supporting data provide a strong foundation in which to pursue the proposed work and include intriguing findings regarding neoantigen biology in our high- fidelity mouse models of HNSCC, novel clinical trial specimens in previously untreated patients and immunophenotyping approaches in difficult to treat recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCCs (RM HNSCC). The mouse oral carcinoma (MOC) model that we developed displays strong conservation to human HNSCC in its carcinogen origin, in vivo biology and response to anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade and represents a platform for mechanistic translational studies. Focusing on the MOC22 model, we identified this tumor line to possess both an endogenous retroviral expressed antigen (p15E) and a mutated ICAM1 (mICAM1) gene that yields a neoantigen. Antigen specific T cells for both of these antigens are present in growing MOC22 tumors. Importantly, specific vaccination experiments result in response for both antigens but surprisingly only the mICAM1 neoantigen provided protection from MOC22 tumor growth. These data have important implications for neoantigen biology highlighting the need to not only identity neoantigens but also to define induced responses in T cells. Coupled with these mechanistic approaches, we have initiated a novel neoadjuvant pembrolizumab clinical trial that has shown surprising clinical results and highlights this approach as an ideal setting in which to address neoantigen biology. Finally, we have immunophenotyped RM HNSCC tumor samples towards understanding the low 15-20% response rates to anti-PD1 therapy. These supporting data will be used to interrogate neoantigen mechanistic studies in the MOC model, define neoantigen landscapes in neoadjuvant pembrolizumab treated samples using novel screening methodologies and define single cell RNA- Sequencing transcriptome in antigen specific T cells. Finally, we will further expand on reports of increased mutational burdens in the RM HNSCC setting to define whether this translates into neoantigen reactivity and the associated T cell transcriptome. In conclusion, these Aims together will directly address the goals of this NIDCR RFA that will ultimately provide therapeutic benefit for HNSCC patients."
"9429537","Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States with >50% of mortality attributed to coronary artery disease. Though ischemic preconditioning, an endogenous protective mechanism used to salvage ischemic myocardium, was described nearly 25 years ago, there has been little to no clinical translation. Protective mechanisms in the heart utilize a number of pathways; however, unifying control points that might integrate this protective response need further characterization. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-?B) and protein kinase A (PKA) are critical regulators of gene transcription in the heart and have contradictory roles in cell death and survival. Activation of NF-?B and PKA is protective to the heart; however, NF-?B and PKA also promote cardiac cell death in the setting of ischemia or oxidant stress. The answer to the question as to why these two important regulators of gene transcription and cardiac physiology produce such a dichotomous response dependent on the stress applied to the system may provide insights into how protective signaling in the heart is integrated. Our laboratories have discovered a novel scaffolding protein known as A- kinase interacting protein 1 (AKIP1) that is expressed at low levels in the heart and is induced by stress. Our preliminary data show that AKIP1 binds to and regulates nuclear localization of PKA catalytic subunit and increases nuclear PKA activity. Preliminary data further show that AKIP1 interacts with and enhances NF-?B nuclear localization in a PKA phosphorylation dependent manner where disruption of AKIP1 binding to PKA enhances nuclear NF-?B. Others have shown that post-translational modification of AKIP1 (e.g., neddylation) recruits the histone deacetylase (SIRT1) to inhibit NF-?B-mediated transcription. Such data suggest that AKIP1 regulates both localization and transcriptional activation of NF-?B and PKA. We hypothesize that AKIP1 may be a key molecular regulator/scaffold that assembles PKA and NF-?B signaling complexes to alter the physiological response of the heart in the basal and stressed state. Understanding the dynamics and physiologic implications of the interaction of PKA and NF-?B with AKIP1 may provide a novel therapeutic control point for limiting cardiac injury associated with ischemic stress. The following aims will test this hypothesis. Aim 1: Determine how hypoxic and oxidant stress alter AKIP1 interactions with NF-?B and PKA and how disruption of this interaction alters stress adaptation in cardiac myocytes. Aim 2: Determine how AKIP1 regulates global and specific effects on the translocation and transcriptional activity of PKA and NF-?B. Aim 3: Determine the impact of AKIP1 interaction with PKA and NF-?B on protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury."
"9683846","PROJECT ABSTRACT ? COMPONENT A (CORE SURVEILLANCE) The Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System (PRAMS) was initiated in 1987 as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiative to reduce infant mortality and low birth weight. In recent years, the program has been expanded in support of CDC?s Safe Motherhood Initiative to promote healthy pregnancies and the delivery of healthy infants. PRAMS is an ongoing, population-based surveillance system designed to identify and monitor selected maternal experiences and behaviors that occur before and during pregnancy and during the child?s early infancy among a stratified sample of women delivering a live birth. Missouri PRAMS has been collecting data since 2007 about the health and well-being of women before, during and shortly after pregnancy and during the child?s early infancy. These data are not routinely available from other sources and can be used to identify groups of women and infants at high risk for health problems and adverse pregnancy / birth outcomes. Missouri PRAMS data is also extremely helpful in monitoring changes in health status of women and children in the state, identification of emerging health issues and measuring progress towards goals in improving the health of mothers and infants in Missouri. Missouri PRAMS uses a standardized data collection methodology developed in accordance with the CDC PRAMS Model Surveillance protocol required for all PRAMS grantees. This standardized approach allows for comparisons among states and for optimal use of the data for single-state or multistate analysis. Each month, a stratified random sample of women delivering a recent live birth is drawn from the state?s birth certificate file and data is collected from this sample of women through mail and telephone modes. The data is weighted so that findings can be applied to the state?s entire population of women with a recent delivery. Missouri PRAMS played a key role during Missouri?s 2015 Title V five-year Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Needs Assessment and identification Missouri?s MCH priorities for the next five years. Missouri PRAMS is the only data source for a variety of national, state performance measures and national outcome measures. Missouri PRAMS continues to be a key resource for program planning, improvement, evaluation and policy development. During this project cycle, Missouri PRAMS will continue to collect high quality data and will further enhance its efforts towards data analysis, linkages, dissemination and translation with a life-course perspective approach."
"9476149","Project Summary/Abstract  Excessive production of glucose by the liver plays a central role in the development of diabetes, where the ability of insulin to regulate hepatic glucose production (HGP) is impaired. FoxO transcription factors are major targets of insulin and play an important role in mediating effects of insulin on multiple aspects of glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver, including gluconeogenesis, glycolysis and lipogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which FoxO proteins exert these diverse effects in an integrated fashion remain poorly understood.  During our previous funding period, we found that a) FoxO proteins also exert important effects on intrahepatic lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation via the regulation of adipose triacylglycerol lipase (ATGL), which mediates the first step in lipolysis, and its inhibitor, the G0/S1 switch 2 gene (G0S2), and b) ATGL-dependent lipolysis plays a critical role in mediating diverse effects of FoxO proteins in the liver, including effects on gluconeogenic, glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression and metabolism. These studies also indicate that ATGL-dependent lipolysis is required to mediate effects of FoxO1 on glycolytic and gluconeogenic gene expression, and additional studies are planned in mouse models and isolated hepatocytes to better understand specific mechanisms mediating this novel link between lipid metabolism and glucoregulation by the insulin/FoxO pathway.  In addition, using liver-specific insulin receptor (IR) knockout (LIRKO) and IR/FoxO1 double knockout (LIRFKO) mice, we also found that disrupting FoxO1 in the liver was sufficient to restore the ability of insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis and suppress HGP (based on euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies) in mice lacking the hepatic insulin receptor. These results indicate that (a) inhibition of FoxO1 is critical for both direct (hepatic) and indirect effects of insulin on HGP and glucose utilization, and (b) extrahepatic effects of insulin are sufficient to maintain normal whole-body and hepatic glucose metabolism when liver FoxO1 activity is disrupted. Based on these findings, additional studies utilizing transgenic and knockout mouse models, cell culture and insulin clamp techniques are planned to determine whether ATGL- dependent lipolysis also plays a critical role in mediating effects of FoxO1 on hepatic glucose metabolism in the setting of hepatic insulin resistance, and whether targeting ATGL and its downstream effectors may provide an effective strategy for treatment of diabetes mellitus in patients with hepatic insulin resistance."
"9557096","Most ovarian cancer is not diagnosed until the disease has reached an advanced stage because the early stage disease is typically non-symptomatic. When diagnosed, extensive intra-abdominal metastases have often developed in the peritoneum. Standard treatment includes a surgical cytoreduction to remove the bulk tumor and a follow-up platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Despite the successful primary treatment, unfortunately, 80?90% of women will experience recurrence of tumors. During the procedure, if all cancerous tissues could be removed, the chance of having an extended disease-free period or even a cure is high. However, some cancerous tissues are not apparent to naked-eye surveillance, hence the surgical outcome can vary. A sensitive and specific dye which could highlight the micro-cancerous tissues would be extremely helpful in minimizing the undesired oversight of leaving cancerous tissue behind and result in a better outcome. In this application, based on our recent finding, we are proposing to develop a sprayable, prompt color changing agent to highlight cancerous tissues with clarity, sensitivity, and specificity. The key component of the proposed cancer highlighter is a fluorogenic near-infrared sensitive dye, which is non-fluorescent in normal tissues but is instantly brightly fluorescent when it is absorbed by the cancer tissues. The cancer selective staining capability of this product will make the surgical procedure precise and effective, as well as make the early identification of recurrence possible."
"9684526","Michigan Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (MI PRAMS) Abstract The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) in Michigan collects state-specific, population-based data on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. The PRAMS sample is chosen from all women who had a live birth recently, so findings can be applied to the state's entire population of women who have recently delivered a live-born infant. The collection of consistent data for Maternal and Child Health Block grant performance measures and health status indicators, as well as evaluation of womens' and children's programs require continued access to different data sources. Michigan PRAMS has been the key database for monitoring the health risk behaviors of pregnant and postpartum women in Michigan since 1988. Michigan PRAMS data are also linked to live birth records but other linkages are possible through the live birth files and we plan to explore their feasibility during the new funding cycle. Linking PRAMS with infant deaths and other data files will allow us to perform more complex analyses to thus develop and implement targeted strategies for addressing racial disparities in maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. We will continue to conduct PRAMS in collaboration with the Office for Survey Research at the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, Michigan State University (MSU). Besides the in-kind support provided by the Project Director other managers at the Michigan Department of Community Health, the grant staff includes the PRAMS epidemiologist (Cristin Larder) and the data analyst from Vital Records (Jose Saraiva) that work on sampling. The Michigan PRAMS goals reflect the collaboration and partnership inside MDCH as well as with outside organizations and are as follows: Obj. #1: Review operational components to assure concordance with standard PRAMS written protocol, and adapt the state-specific portions of the written protocol to meet state needs.Obj#2:Assure appropriate staff dedicated to overall coordination and operations of PRAMS. Identify individual in Vital Records dedicated to assuring sampling procedures. Obj#3:Maintain a PRAMS advisory, and solicit input on PRAMS activities: Obj#4 Assure active collaboration among all participating organizational units, including MCH, Vital Records, Epidemiology, and MSU/IPPSR as well as any other programs that may have a contribution or benefit from PRAMS findings: Obj#5. Anaalyse PRAMS data and use the findings for either developing new program strategies and policies or for improving the existing ones. Annual reports have been published for 1995-1998, and then annually since 1999. A new format has been developed in 2004 for the 2000 PRAMS report that includes chapters addressing topics of concerns to Michigan such as unintended pregnancy, safe sleep position among infants, risk factors for domestic violence among pregnant and postpartum women, folic acid awareness, etc. Quarterly newsletters with specific topics selected based on the state public health priorities are also developed. These publications are extremely useful for MCH program directors and staff as well as providers and other partners. Collaborations with internal programs as well as with external partners are in place and will be further strengthened through the Advisory Committee activities. In conclusion, Michigan plans to not only continue but also to improve the process and expand the PRAMS data use."
"9460506","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Theories of attention and learning differ in the roles they prescribe to memory representations. Theories of attention almost universally propose that visual working memory representations determine which objects are the focuses of processing in complex visual scenes. However, models of learning propose that after a handful of trials, the control of visual cognition should shift from being driven by visual working memory to representations in long-term memory. In this project we will bring these ideas from models of learning to bear on the processing of visual information. To test these model predictions in a definitive manner, we will develop methods of measuring electrical brain activity that we can use to track what information is being actively held in visual working memory, simultaneously with independent measures of the representations in visual long-term memory. Our preliminary data indicate that these electrophysiological tools can provide trial-by-trial indices of memory representations controlling visual cognition. Our integrated modeling and neuroscientific approach will allow us to more quickly lay a theoretical foundation for understanding the top-down control of visual processing. This can then be used to understand the nature of deficits in clinical populations and to refine potential treatments."
"9624375","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic dysfunction of external urethral sphincter (EUS) contraction and relaxation is a consequence of neurological pathology such as detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (increase of urethral resistance during voiding) after spinal cord injury (SCI) that disrupts central nervous system regulation of micturition reflexes. This results in dys-coordination between detrusor and EUS. A variety of neuromodulation approaches are developed to modulate the lower urinary tract (LUT) function by targeting the Onuf's nucleus located at lumbosacral levels. Here, we propose a novel method on stimulating spinal EUS relaxation controlling center by using epidural stimulation (EpS) to modulate EUS relaxation between storage and voiding phases. Spinal EUS relaxation controlling center will be identified by using EpS over several upper lumbar levels (L2-4) based on the previous publication (Chang et al., 2007) and preliminary results. Modulation of EUS relaxation controlling center by EpS possibly facilitates voiding by suppressing EUS tonic contraction, in other words, inhibits urethral resistance. After chronic SCI, a combination of EpS and serotonergic input promotes the suppression of EUS tonic contraction and further evokes the EUS relaxation during voiding. EpS of EUS relaxation controlling center provides the key for switching EUS activation between tonic contraction and relaxation. Functional assessment of LUT will be investigated to provide the information of voiding efficiency in the animals with neurogenic bladder dysfunction after chronic SCI. The proposed study focusing on EUS neuromodulation by using EpS (bioengineering aspect) and/or serotonergic modulation (pharmacological aspect) represents a cutting-edge research approach to improve LUT function with neurogenic bladder, and can be also used to reduce urethral resistance with impaired voiding contractions such as neurogenic bladder dysfunction of overactive and underactive bladders, peripheral nerve injuries, and aging."
"9552680","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjgren's syndrome (SS) are autoimmune diseases with a complicated pathogenesis involving many aspects of the immune system. There is a strong gender bias in both SLE and SS, with 10 times more women affected than men. In both male and female patients with established SLE, sex hormones are abnormal. However, at the diagnosis of SLE, prior to therapy and regardless of age of onset, there are no abnormalities. The PI has reported that compared to the general or control population, Klinefelter's syndrome (male 47,XXY) is 15-fold and 38-fold over-represented among men with SLE and SS, respectively. These data and calculations using Bayes' theorum indicate that Klinefelter men have at least the same risk of SLE and SS as women. Therefore, based on these data, the PI has proposed an X chromosome gene effect for SLE and SS, which is a new hypothesis for the sex bias found in these disorders. Additional new data support this notion. We find 47,XXX statistically increased in female SLE (7 of 2826) and SS (3 of 1,033) patients, as compared to controls (2 of 7,074). We found no increase in 47,XXX in primary biliary cirrhosis and RA subjects, both of which have a female bias, indicating alternative mechanisms for sex bias. Women with 47,XXX are phenotypically normal in terms of sex hormones, menarche, pregnancy and menopause. Data from studies of SLE in mice with XX and XY females as well as XX and XY males also strongly support the hypothesis that increasing number of X chromosomes imparts additional risk of SLE/SS without regard to sex hormones. Based on data generated by the PI as well as these mouse data we hypothesize that X-linked genes that escape X inactivation in both man and mouse, DDX3X, CXorf38, KDM6A, KDM5C CA5B EIF2S3 may cause an increased risk of SLE or SS to persons with 2 or more X chromosomes, regardless of sex. Our proposed study will be the first to examine differential gene and protein expression of genes that escape X inactivation between normal men and women and those with extranumerary X chromosomes. New preliminary data support DDX3X and CXorf38 ( an uncharacterized gene and protein product) as possible mediators of the X chromosome dose effect as we have found correlations of expression in both proteins with X chromosome number. The DDX3X protein is a critical component of a cytoplasmic pathway recognizing nucleic acids, and culminates in interferon production. This pathway is parallel with, but independent of the toll-like receptor-dependent pathway in the endosome that also recognizes nucleic acid, produces interferon and is involved in SLE pathogenesis. Furthermore, interferon production through the DDX3X pathway is higher in woman compared to men. Preliminary Data show that CXorf38 is expressed in B cells, expression is greater in female cells compared to male cells and that this protein may be involved in B cells activation. In Specific Aim 1, DDX3X and each of the other 5 genes will be tested as possible mediator(s) of the X chromosome dose effect by defining protein levels of the six genes in human immune cells and mouse tissues. In Specific Aim 2, we will establish a functional role for differentially overexpressed X-linked genes in SLE human subjects and mouse models. In the final Specific aim, we will characterize severity and susceptibility of induced and spontaneous lupus in a chromosome aneuploidy mouse model."
"9684527","Project Summary Nebraska (NE) PRAMS has collected high scientific quality, population-based data on topics related to experiences before, during, and after pregnancy since 1999. PRAMS complements the vital records database adding nuances that only self-reported data can do. The following shows examples of issues that need to be addressed to improve the health of mothers and babies in Nebraska. Rates of infant mortality in Nebraska are significantly worse in some racial/ethnic groups (Black, American Indian, Hispanic and Mexican) are considerably higher than the Healthy People (HP) 2020 goal of 6.0 infants per 1,000 live births. Prenatal care initiated during the first trimester of pregnancy for all racial/ethnic groups are below the HP 2020 goal of 77.9%. Nebraska's racial and ethnic diversity has increased over the past decade and most of the growth in the state's population is projected to come from the young minority population. NE PRAMS stratifies by race/ethnicity and will continue to provide data to plan strategies to address these issues and for evaluation. Up to three self-administered questionnaires are mailed to sampled mothers. Mothers, who do not respond to any of the mailings, are followed up by telephone and encouraged to complete a telephone interview. Overall response rates have always been higher than the required CDC response rate threshold. NE PRAMS continues to develop methods to increase our response rates with the Black and American Indian populations that have consistently had lower response rates, due to locating them than actual refusals. This includes expanding sources to locate current phone numbers and addresses, and offering different rewards/incentives in the questionnaire packets. PRAMS information is provided in prenatal and postpartum hospital packets and during exhibits at health fairs to communicate the importance of completing the PRAMS questionnaire. NE PRAMS continues to be vital in planning, implementing and evaluating programs in the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (NDHHS) Maternal and Child Health (MCH) programs. NE PRAMS data is utilized for reports; to develop brochures, posters, press releases, fact sheets, and data books by many NDHHS programs, local health departments, and community health organizations. NE PRAMS will continue to produce fact sheets, data reports, completing data requests and collaborating on projects with statewide public health programs."
"9651680","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic subjective tinnitus is a common and sometimes disabling condition, with few effective treatments and no cure. Tinnitus is thought to involve dysfunction in central brain networks subsequent to peripheral injury or interference; thus, neurostimulation therapies that directly target central circuits are receiving growing interest. Of these, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an attractive option, due to its relative affordability, mobility, and safety profile. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that tDCS of temporal/auditory cortex is effective at transiently reducing tinnitus symptoms, including tinnitus loudness and tinnitus distress. However, the results of previous clinical trials are variable, and a mechanistic understanding of tDCS and its therapeutic effects remains elusive. The main goal of this research is to lay the groundwork for improved, patient-centered approaches to noninvasive neurostimulation therapy for chronic tinnitus. Ultimately, we plan to use each patient?s unique brain-connectivity patterns to inform the placement of neurostimulation electrodes and improve therapeutic outcome. To accomplish this, we will first determine how the intrinsic activity and connectivity of auditory networks are affected during simultaneous tDCS-fMRI of auditory cortex, specifically targeting those patients who experience reduced tinnitus symptoms after tDCS (Aim 1). Then, we will perturb those networks with more focal stimulation using high-definition (HD) tDCS, using each patient?s unique functional neuroanatomy to position HD tDCS electrodes. Perturbation of target networks will be assessed with simultaneous HD tDCS-fMRI, and effects on clinical outcome will be measured (Aim 2). Though the primary goal of the proposed research is to optimize tDCS for the treatment of tinnitus, these studies will also provide a wealth of information regarding tinnitus pathophysiology and the mechanisms of tDCS more generally, which is being investigated for the treatment of a wide variety of brain disorders and injuries."
"9460297","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The importance of T cell based immunity in preventing skin infections is well studied and best exemplified by patients with genetic defects in the CD4+ Th17 pathway (e.g. hyper IgE syndrome). Patients with defects in the generation of antibody responses (e.g. X-linked agammaglobulinemia, hyper IgM syndrome) also suffer from recurrent skin bacterial pyogenic and viral infections. In addition, antibody responses to antigen found in the skin are pathogenic in numerous autoimmune blistering diseases and participate in atopic dermatitis and the atopic march. Despite the clear importance of humoral responses to skin health and disease, the mechanisms that generate antibody responses to cutaneous antigen are very poorly studied. Skin-resident dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen presenting cells that acquire antigen in the skin. One DC subset, Langerhans cells (LC), form a dense DC network in the epidermis. They extend their dendrites to the upper epidermis and into the stratum corneum where they are able to acquire antigen. We have discovered that LC 1) drive the generation of CD4+ T follicular helper cells (Tfh) that provide T cell help for B cells ad 2) are sufficient to induce humoral response under steady-state conditions. Thus, a major unappreciated function of LC during homeostatic conditions is the generation of Tfh and the associated humoral response. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that LC have a unique role in the generation of antibody responses to cutaneous antigen. In addition to LC in the epidermis, there are 2 major subsets of DC in the dermis. In the setting of a skin infection all 3 DC subsets promote distinct Th subset differentiation. We hypothesize that this distinction occurs during steady-state conditions as well and that only LC have the capacity to differentiate Tfh. We hypothesized that in addition to expanding Tfh, LC also transport intact cutaneous antigen to B cells. Finally, we hypothesize that LC are required to promote antibody responses during pathogen infection and for the generation of antibodies against skin commensal microorganisms. Understanding which DC subset, conditions and pathways drive the formation of antibodies specific for cutaneous antigen is critical to understanding the mechanisms of resistance to skin pathogens and the etiology of antibody-mediated skin diseases. This work has the potential to provide novel therapeutic targets for the modulation of skin immune function."
"9552699","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Over the years, this program has made numerous fundamental contributions to the field of protein kinase CK2 functional biology in the context of prostate cancer. Developments in the field of CK2 have prompted the concept that CK2 serves as a master regulator in diverse functions in the cell. CK2 is dysregulated in all cancers including prostate cancer. Suppression of apoptosis by CK2, originally discovered by us, is regarded as one of its key functions as it provides a clear link of this kinase to the cancer cell phenotype. A focus of cancer therapeutics for more than a decade has been the development of therapies targeting protein kinases (PKs). PKs represent a large part of the genome involved in a multitude of key cellular functions. CK2 (formerly casein kinase 2 or II) is one such PK that has emerged as a significant target for cancer therapy, as originally proposed by us. Targeted cancer therapy has generally relied on single agent therapy; however, the emerging concept is that combinatorial therapy simultaneously targeting several downstream signals may be a more effective approach to eradicating the neoplastic disease. The focus of this research proposal is to investigate mechanisms of CK2 mediated regulation of cell survival and death which may lead to identification of additional targets for combinatorial therapy with anti-CK2 in various cancers. This research accords with the VA healthcare mission since prostate cancer is a major health issue in the veteran population and need for better management of this disease (and other cancers) remains critical. CK2 regulation of cell death and cell survival may occur at diverse levels; however, our recent observations suggest that mitochondrial machinery is a key locus of this function. One of the earliest responses of prostate cells to inhibition of CK2 is a change in mitochondrial membrane potential. Underlying mechanisms of how CK2 exerts its control on events leading to cell death or survival remain to be investigated. We propose two hypotheses: First, CK2 regulates intracellular Ca2+ signaling as the primary event to initiate activation of th executioner function of mitochondria (to be studied under Specific Aims 1 and 2). Second, increased CK2 expression levels influence mitochondrial function and activity as a mechanism of promoting cell survival. To address these hypotheses, we will undertake the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1 is to investigate the role of CK2 in cellular dynamics of Ca2+, a key mediator of cell death. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate mechanism(s) by which CK2 regulates Ca2+ signaling-related mitochondrial function involving cell death and survival, and determine the CK2 regulation of crosstalk between mitochondria and ER. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the effects of increased CK2 expression levels on prostate cell mitochondrial function and activity. These comprehensive studies will significantly advance our knowledge on how CK2 functions in regulation of cell death and survival leading to a new paradigm in our understanding of CK2 function in cancer. Additionally, the data gained from completion of these studies will also yield potentially translatable information since CK2 is currently regarded as a cancer therapy target and there is also increasing interest in mitochondrial functions as targets of therapy. Identification of mitochondrial targets downstream of CK2 function would raise the potential of generating new combinatorial therapy approaches targeting cell death and survival machinery. The concepts and strategies proposed by us are original -elucidation of the mechanism(s) by which CK2 regulates cell death and survival will expand the fundamental knowledge on CK2 function in normal and disease state and potentially lead to identification of novel combinatorial therapeutic approaches in various cancers."
"9467084","SUMMARY Metastases of tumors are associated with more than 90% of cancer deaths. Despite years of therapeutic development, mortality has improved only incrementally by few months at best. The preclinical development phase for modern metastatics currently misses critical quantitative information on metastatic progression. Multi-point in vivo observation of early metastasis and quantitative assessment of its development would enable unprecedented precision of longitudinal control. PhotoSound Technologies, Inc. proposes a novel platform for in vivo molecular imaging that addresses the critical barrier in quantitative preclinical imaging of metastasis via contrasted dual-modality 3D imaging approach. The proposed project promises to enable in vivo quantification of numbers and volumes of early metastatic tumors, which is critical for preclinical development of future anti-metastatics. The platform integrates a 3D photoacoustic tomography into a multi-modality imaging platform with a coregistered 3D fluorescence unit (PAFT) and a switchable optical nanoprobe targeted to the studied metastatic cells. The nanoprobe has capability to activate optical and fluorescence contrasts upon external illumination with safe levels of pulsed laser radiation, and it was designed to maximize benefits of dual-modality PAFT imaging. The fluorescence imaging component of PAFT is used to boost detection sensitivity by providing low-resolution spatial constraint for the distribution of activated nanoprobes, which are then precisely mapped in 3D by photoacoustic imaging component. The ultimate objective is to maintain the molecular sensitivity of state-of-the-art fluorescence techniques, while boosting spatial resolution of the detected metastasis 10-fold. Current trends on $1.5B market of in vivo small animal imaging favor commercial introduction of the proposed multi-modal imaging platform, which is designed for table-top application and has a 3D anatomical reference component implemented through a photoacoustic unit. PAFT could be also used as a universal instrument for 3D functional imaging of volumetric blood content and oxygenation without a need for any contrast agent, imaging of various NIR absorbing probes and bioluminescent cells. Such versatility would be attractive for Animal Research Facilities engaged in a broad spectrum of fundamental and preclinical imaging studies. Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility for the PAFT-nanoprobe imaging platform to detect and quantify early metastasis in a preclinical murine model. The focus of Phase II will be the development of a commercial imaging platform that is optimized to monitor the in vivo effects of anti-metastatic therapies. When our system is benchmarked against the current standards of optical imaging, we expect to find a 10x increase in spatial resolution enabling detection of metastases separated by only 0.5 mm, as well as quantitative assessment of individual tumor volumes."
"9567499","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is a common, morbid and highly lethal disease of primarily older patients. While surgery and stent-grafting are highly effective in preventing death by rupture from larger AAA, they represent complex procedures with multiple potential complica-tions. Importantly, there are currently no therapeutic strategies that limit the growth of aneurysms, due in large part to a lack of understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease and progression. In addition to tobacco use, genetic predilection, and male sex, the most important risk factor for AAA is advanced age. As such, it is not surprising that over 68,000 Veterans within the VHA suffer from AAA. After age 65 years, the prevalence of AAA increases by 6% per decade. To better understand this relationship, we examined a preclinical animal model of AAA in both young and aged male mice, and observed accelerated disease formation and enhanced interleukin-6(IL6)- based inflammatory signaling with aging. We also found that miR-24 is downregulated in murine AAA models, as well as human AAA tissue. Furthermore, microarray transcriptional profiling showed that a highly significant percentage of the putative targets of miR-24 were differentially and inversely upregulated during AAA development. Additionally we found that miR-24 is downregulated by IL6 in vascular smooth muscle and macrophages in vitro. We hypothesize aging enhances IL6 signaling, leading to downregulation of vascular miR-24. Reduced activity of miR-24, in turn, is permissive for a panel of downstream inflammatory genes that play a role in aging-accelerated AAA development. Therefore, enhancing miR-24 expression and activity within the aortic wall may have therapeutic benefit. To investigate this molecular cascade, we will use pharmacological and molecular methods to delineate the signaling events initiated by IL6 in vitro that result in decreased miR-24 levels (Specific Aim 1). Next, we will elucidate the effects manipulating miR-24 levels have upon inflammatory gene expression and cellular function (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will alter miR-24 levels in vivo to evaluate the effects upon age-accelerated AAA formation (Specific Aim 3). Completion of these specific aims will delineate a novel mechanism that may underlie age-related vascular inflammation and accelerated aneurysm formation and provide the basis for clinical translation."
"9468973","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry ? clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience ? will be attained via this mentored research proposal."
"9461488","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are noncoding long (>100 bases) single- stranded RNAs that have burst onto the scene as major regulators of gene expression. MicroRNAs, are about 22 base long single-stranded RNAs that came to the fore about a decade back and this laboratory has been among the pioneers that demonstrated the roles of several microRNAs in the differentiation of skeletal muscle myoblasts to myotubes. We now propose to use our expertise in the role of RNAs in muscle differentiation to determine the mechanism by which one particular muscle- differentiation-induced (MDI) lncRNA, MUNC, regulates gene expression and promotes muscle differentiation. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that MUNC is essential for muscle differentiation because of its role in either regulating the binding or the expression of critical myogenic transcription factors as a constituent of novel protein complexes involved in gene regulation. Aim 2 will carry out structure function studies on mouse and human MUNC to test the hypothesis that evolutionarily conserved domains exist in this lncRNA that are critical for its mechanism of action. Aim 3 will identify new protein and DNA partners of MUNC to identify functions of MUNC independent of Myogenic transcription factors. This Aim will also identify additional lncRNAs that are induced during muscle differentiation and integrate their role in differentiation with that of MUNC and MyoD.  This is an exciting project that involves the collaboration of a molecular biologist with a skeletal muscle physiologist. It wil use new experimental reagents such as lncRNAs and state-of-the-art approaches like ChIRP. LC-MS-MS, SILAC and ChiRP-seq to discover the mechanism of action of one lncRNA in control of cell-type specificity. Since our preliminary results identify tens of novel lncRNAs induced during differentiation, at least some of which already implicated in differentiation, success of this project will launch a prolonged investigation of several lncRNAs in this very important paradigm of differentiation."
"9458109","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bone homeostasis is maintained by the balanced functions of bone-forming osteoblasts (OBs) and bone- resorbing osteoclasts (OCs). Excessive OC activity can cause pathogenic bone loss, so it is important to understand the molecular signaling and genetic programs controlling the commitment, maturation, and resorption phases of OC development. Current bone loss treatments target early OC commitment and/or later viability. Long-term use of these treatments may cause compromised bone strength, possibly due to inhibition of coupled bone formation, which requires positive interplay between OCs and OBs. A better treatment strategy may be to target late-stage OC biology in favor of early OC differentiation, and in fact some recent clinical trials have successfully employed targeted inhibition of resorption without observed diminution of either OC numbers or coupled bone formation. Therefore, better understanding the regulatory factors and mechanisms of OC maturation may be extremely useful for providing better therapeutic targets. In particular, a growing number of cell adhesion molecules are now implicated in bone homeostasis and they are good potential targets for clinical intervention. Therefore, we designed a screening protocol -- described in this proposal -- to identify genes dually associated with OC maturation and cell adhesion. We now identify IgSF11, which has no previously reported function in bone, as being required specifically for progression from the commitment to the mature stages of osteoclast differentiation. We have generated and employed IGSF11-/- mice to preliminarily show that IGSF11-/- OC maturation in vitro is defective, demonstrating a potential genetic link to further pursue OC maturation-related therapeutic strategies. We therefore propose the following specific aims: 1. Investigate the effect of IgSF11 deficiency on osteoclast development and function. To begin to define the requirement for IGSF11 in OC biology per se, we will first assess early IGSF11-/- OC commitment ex vivo, and then interrogate IGSF11-/- OC maturation through gene expression and cell biologic approaches ex vivo. To examine the effects of IGSF11 deficiency on bone homeostasis, OC function and maturation in vivo, we will subject IGSF11-/- bones and bone sections obtained under normal, OVX, PTH-treated, or inflammatory conditions to high-resolution micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry, as well as TRAP staining. 2. Determine mechanisms of IgSF11 function in the context of osteoclast biology. We will determine whether IgSF11 is required for adhesion between cells during OC maturation by mixing IgSF11-expressing and IgSF11- deficient OC cultures. The effects of OC IgSF11 deficiency on expression and function of known OC- associated cell adhesion factors will be assayed. Via mutational analysis, regulation of homo- and hetero-typic interactions and cell signaling by specific IgSF11 domains retrovirally expressed in OCs will be analyzed. These experiments will address not only whether IgSF11 is required for OC cell adhesion, but also the specificity of IgSF11-mediated adhesion and potential signaling mechanisms in the context of OC maturation."
"9462723","NEUROPATHOLOGY CORE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The underlying philosophy of the Neuropathology Core is the belief that validation of diagnosis is critical to clinical research into neurodegenerative diseases and that tissue- and other biospecimen-based studies are a vital complement to in vitro studies of the biologic processes underlying these diseases. From these two pillars to the clinical and scientific community, the Core is able to make a contribution to the amelioration of suffering associated with AD and related disorders. The Core therefore supports the overall mission of the MADRC through the collection, characterization, storage and distribution of brain tissue and other biospecimens (CSF, plasma, DNA, RNA, etc) from subjects who have been well-characterized clinically. Samples from the Core have contributed to significant advances in our understanding of the biologic processes that characterize neurodegenerative diseases, both at early and later stages. The Core will serve to catalyze research into AD through collection, characterization and distribution of samples to individual investigators, larger consortia and collaborative groups and through data sharing with NACC (Aims 1-4). There are components of the Core's activities which are innovative, focused on developing novel tissue handling methods for high resolution microscopy which is important for understanding of early events in AD, on developing novel methods for imaging sharing and analysis and on harnessing opportunities provided by large epidemiologic studies to gather samples from control and early stage subjects (Aims 5-7). Finally, there is an educational component of the Core: training neuropathologists to be expert in diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and in the operations of tissue repositories in support of research; and teaching other health professionals about the importance of autopsy and tissue donation for research (Aims 8 & 9). The Core is integrated into all Center activities with active interactions with Administrative, Clinical and Outreach Cores regarding autopsy permission and education, with the Data Core regarding data storage and communication with NACC, and with the projects. Projects 2 and 3 both depend on neuropathological samples from the Core, and our routine evaluation of brains includes attention to the white matter, which complements Project 1's Connectome studies. We also support the local research community and national initiatives, with 309 requests for materials over the past 4 years (including >3600 frozen tissue samples and >17,000 unstained section). Thus, there is an ever-increasing role for the activities of the Core in contributing to research in AD and other dementing illnesses."
"9412381","High rates of substance use disorders in Veterans compared to the general population are heavily influenced by psychosocial factors ? such as difficulty reintegrating into civilian life due to avoidance of vital support systems ? leading to disproportionately elevated unmet addiction treatment needs. Those using both cocaine and heroin have mortality rates 14.3 times higher than the general population. 30-60% of patients receiving methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) for opioid use disorder actively use cocaine. There are currently no approved psychopharmacological treatments for cocaine use disorder, and drop-out rates from MMT programs and vital psychosocial treatments are as high as 80% for cocaine users. What?s more, cocaine use, compared to other drugs, is particularly driven by social stress, and cocaine is associated with hyperreactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Preclinical and pilot clinical findings suggest that administration of oxytocin, a mammalian neuropeptide, may have a multitude of direct anti-addiction effects, improve engagement in psychosocial treatments, and attenuate hyperreactivity of the HPA axis in patients with cocaine use disorder. This is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of fifty Veterans with active cocaine use disorder, also receiving MMT in an opioid treatment program, randomized to receive either oxytocin 40 IU or placebo intranasally twice daily for six weeks. The primary outcome measure will be oxytocin?s effectiveness at reducing cocaine use as measured by quantitative levels of the cocaine metabolite, benzoylecgonine, in weekly urine samples. Potential mechanisms of treatment response will be evaluated by measuring oxytocin?s effectiveness at a) improving therapeutic alliance with treatment providers (Working Alliance Inventory, client and therapist forms) and attendance in existing clinic-run treatment components and b) attenuating social stress-reactivity by measuring self- reported cocaine craving, psychophysiological stress measures, and salivary cortisol in response to a Trier Social Stress Test. In sum, discrepancies between Veterans and civilians in addiction prevalence, severity, and successful intervention are largely driven by higher rates of social avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptoms among Veterans. This study will uniquely combine psychopharmacological and evidence-based psychosocial interventions targeted at reducing cocaine use, improving treatment engagement, and preventing stress-related cocaine use among Veterans with co- occurring cocaine and opioid use disorders receiving MMT."
"9452990","Pathogens must successfully navigate the complex interaction networks of their hosts to survive. During malaria parasite liver stage infection, parasites protect their host hepatocyte by preventing its death and exploiting the host cell resources for growth and development. The host hepatocyte molecular signaling landscape that facilitates successful liver stage replication has not been elucidated, yet it is highly medically relevant. During the first award period of this grant, we have made significant strides towards elucidating a number of signaling pathways upon which the malaria parasite relies and also identified the critical host receptor which parasites engage during entry to establish a permissive environment for intracellular replication and optimal development. We have generated preliminary data that suggests that malaria parasites must not only control conventional forms of host cell defense such as apoptosis, but also must carefully regulate an iron- dependent form of cell death called ferroptosis, which to our knowledge has never before been implicated in host defense against pathogen. This proposal aims to fully delineate the pro-death milieu that the parasite can evade, and what perturbations lead to the demise of the wild-type parasite. We will test the hypothesis that the tumor suppressor P53 is the regulator of ferroptosis in infected cells. We will build on our data which demonstrates that P53 is suppressed by Plasmodium infection, and increasing P53 levels can eliminate liver stage parasites. Finally, we will build on our recent discovery that parasites select a subset of hepatocytes for infection and determine the impact of this selection on establishing optimal host conditions for parasite survival. Throughout the proposed experiments, we will monitor hepatocyte signals not only in response to rodent malaria infection, but also in response to the most deadly human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, in part by using hepatocytes from a mouse with a humanized liver. The proposed studies will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the hepatocyte signaling landscape that regulates the success or demise of the Plasmodium liver stage. Accomplishing our aims opens the possibility of altering key host factors with small-molecules that could prevent a wild-type parasite from progressing to symptomatic erythrocyte infection. Such a host-based approach for prophylaxis is novel and will circumvent the massive problem of continuously developing resistance to standard antimalarial drugs. This approach is further fostered by the fact that many hepatocyte proteins are already targets of known therapeutic inhibitors. A more detailed understanding of the complex perturbations elicited by this important intracellular pathogen might also reveal new aspects of hepatocyte signaling."
"9471210","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that can cause cognitive impairment (CI). Physical interventions, such as continuous positive airway pressure, may help to prevent OSA, but the discomfort of wearing such a device during sleep hinders its practical use. This limitation highlights the clinical importance of pharmaceutical interventions that can prevent OSA or its major sequelae. In this study, we will test and validate animal models that are susceptible to OSA-triggered CI and will determine the efficacy of a novel compound in preventing this CI in a relevant mouse model.  OSA does not cause CI in every patient; rather, it occurs in only one-quarter of the susceptible patients. Although it is unclear what may lead to the development of this subgroup of patients susceptible to CI, we recently discovered that G protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 (GRK5) deficiency does so in mice. In fact, GRK5 deficiency makes the subjects susceptible to CI that is triggered not only by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) or OSA but also by mutant human ?-amyloid (A?) precursor protein (APP) and aging. The underlying mechanisms are a series of cascading events that all begin with a selectively impaired M2 muscarinic receptor desensitization that is caused by the loss or deficiency of GRK5. Omitting much of the detail, the high selectivity on M2 receptors limits the entire impact on the cholinergic system, which includes not only the basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons but also the postsynaptic cholinoceptive neurons that are widely distributed in the hippocampus as well. The actual impact of GRK5 deficiency on the cholinergic system is to rather inconspicuously make the cholinergic and cholinoceptive neurons vulnerable, which invites secondary degenerative insults such as A? or CIH to trigger neurodegeneration. Owing to the high selectivity of GRK5 deficiency on M2 receptors, a selective M2 blockade was found to be highly effective in preventing the cascading events. In this regard, CN158 is a novel M2 selective antagonist (patent pending) that outperforms other known M2 antagonists. Moreover, it had outstanding pharmacological properties in our preliminary in vivo studies and therefore will be tested in this project.  We hypothesize that CIH-triggered CI is more likely to occur in GRK5-deficient subjects and that an M2 blockade by CN158 can effectively prevent CIH-triggered CI and the underlying neurodegeneration in the BF cholinergic and hippocampal cholinoceptive neurons in GRK5-deficient mice. We will address our hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1. To verify whether GRK5 deficiency leads to susceptibility to CIH-triggered CI and the underlying neurodegeneration of the cholinergic system, we will expose GRK5-deficient mice to various CIH conditions before assessing their behavioral and neuropathological changes.  Aim 2. To determine whether M2 blockade by CN158 effectively prevents CIH-triggered CI and the degeneration of the cholinergic system, we will treat GRK5-deficient mice exposed to an optimal CIH condition with CN158 and a known M2 antagonist control (anthranilamide derivative 23) in a randomized trial with the same behavioral and neuropathological analyses used in Aim 1.  The success of this project is expected to establish empirical evidence that CIH-triggered CI in GRK5-deficient subjects is pharmaceutically preventable and that CN158 may serve as a lead compound in fulfilling such a purpose."
"9500823","Thoracic aortic aneurysm occurs in approximately 50?70% of patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which affects 1?2% of the general population. There is a critical need to develop evidence to determine criteria for surgical intervention and to develop treatment that will prevent or reverse aneurysms for BAV patients. Thoracic aortic aneurysm in BAV frequently involves the proximal aorta, with smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that originate from neural crest stem cells (NCSCs). However, it spares the descending thoracic aorta, which has SMCs that originate from the paraxial mesoderm. The long-term goal of our research is to determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for the aortopathy associated with BAV and develop therapeutic strategies for aortic aneurysm in BAV. The objective of this research is to model BAV aortopathy in vitro using SMCs derived from BAV induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and in vivo using tissue-engineered vessels generated from these SMCs. Models will be used to explore treatments for aortic aneurysm in BAV. Our central hypothesis is that BAV aortic SMCs are defective in TGF-?-dependent differentiation of SMCs from NCSCs but not paraxial mesoderm and this defect causes decreased contractile function and secretion of extracellular matrix from these cells, resulting in aortopathy and subsequent aneurysm at the proximal aorta in BAV. Aim 1: We will characterize defects in vascular SMC differentiation in BAV/aneurysm cases in vitro. We will differentiate BAV and control iPSCs into NCSCs and paraxial mesoderm, then SMCs. We will determine the differentiation, contractility, and extracellular matrix of the BAV- and control-SMCs. We will define the key signaling pathway leading to defective differentiation in BAV NCSC-SMCs with a focus on canonical TGF-? signaling and myocardin transcription as identified in our pilot study. We will also perform RNA-seq to unbiasedly identify other potential pathways causing the defective differentiation of SMCs from NCSCs. We will rescue the defective differentiation of BAV SMCs from the NCSC lineage through pathways independent of the TGF-? pathway, such as rapamycin, which promotes SMC differentiation by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin and activating Akt2. Aim 2: We will determine the mechanism of aneurysm formation in vivo using nude rabbits that host engineered aorta generated from BAV patients? iPSCs. We will create tissue-engineered vessels populated with BAV NCSC-SMCs to replace the rabbits? abdominal aorta. We will determine the biomechanics and aneurysm formation of the engineered vessels in rabbits, and we will define differentiation and maturation of the SMCs and the TGF-? signaling of the engineered vessel. Finally, we will incorporate rapamycin into the scaffold to prevent the aneurysm in engineered vessels. Our human iPSC in vitro and in vivo model is innovative for studying the mechanisms of thoracic aortic aneurysm in BAV and for screening therapeutic agents. These studies will produce novel data on aortopathy, clarify mechanisms of aortic aneurysm formation in BAV patients, guide surgical intervention, and provide a foundation for future medical treatment of aortic aneurysm in BAV."

To that end, the Core conducts comprehensive clinical evaluations in patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease, cognitively normal older controls (>65 years), and middle-aged adults (45-65 years) with varying levels of dementia risk based on their family history of the disease. The Clinical Core team works closely with all Wisconsin ADRC Cores to facilitate the overall mission of the Center by participating in outreach and recruitment activities to diverse communities; conducting standardized clinical and cognitive assessments of Core participants; gathering ancillary aging-related cognitive and clinical data, including a detailed vascular risk assessment; collecting high-quality blood, CSF, and DNA biospecimens; coordinating biospecimen collection with neuroimaging; completing standardized data reporting in a timely manner; consenting Core participants for brain autopsy; facilitating cognitive testing and CSF collection within investigator-initiated studies; and ensuring timely availability of participants, data, and biospecimens to researchers both locally and nationally. Specific Aim 1: To continue to recruit and retain a pool of well- characterized middle-aged adults who are at risk for Alzheimer's disease, yet do not yet have symptoms of the disease, as well as a cohort of patients with mild cognitive impairment for regular clinical and cognitive evaluations and biomarker assessments (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and CSF and blood samples) to support translational research in preclinical dementia. Specific Aim 2: To continue to recruit and retain patients with mild late-onset AD and cognitively healthy older adults to undergo structured clinical and cognitive evaluations annually and to continue to encourage participation in biomarker assessments to support translational research in dementia and normal cognitive aging. Specific Aim 3: To integrate culturally-tailored outreach, education, and clinical services to diverse communities throughout Wisconsin in order to increase awareness of brain health and encourage long-term participation and advocacy for research within underrepresented minority communities. Specific Aim 4: To continue to obtain consent from Core participants for brain autopsy to support clinical-pathologic research and to collect CSF, blood, and DNA biospecimens for translational research on preclinical markers of dementia. Specific Aim 5: To continue to provide infrastructure, resources, and services to facilitate collaborative research in preclinical dementia, normal cognitive aging, and Alzheimer's disease locally and nationally. Through this work, Wisconsin ADRC investigators hope to identify early brain changes in asymptomatic people at risk for Alzheimer's disease in order to diagnose and treat the disease before any memory loss occurs."
"9541941","PROJECT SUMMARY ! Inherited axonopathies include the clinically distinct phenotypes, Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) and Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), which both cause slowly-progressing, length-dependent axonal degeneration. Both phenotypes are genetically and phenotypically diverse with close to 100 Mendelian genes involved for each thus far. The clinical and genetic overlap between these diseases is increasingly apparent; thus, they can be grouped together as a spectrum of inherited axonopathies and are expected to share common molecular pathologies. It is becoming apparent that despite the spectacular progress in novel gene identification, non-traditional modes of inheritance, risk allele, and modifier genes need to be considered. The focus of this proposal is to characterize the genetic architecture from causative to rare risk alleles more completely by applying exome sequencing and heuristic (variant filtering approaches of exomes/genomes) as well as statistical approaches (rare variant burden analysis) to large patient and control cohorts. We have access to possibly the largest such exome collections in the world. Further, an in silico network biology approach based on known and novel genes (full and partial penetrant) will be used to reveal key cellular pathways that are commonly correlated with inherited axonopathies. By further defining the molecular and genetic etiologies underlying inherited axonopathies, therapeutic targets of broader axonal degeneration may be elucidated. !"
"9551524","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies account for nearly half of worldwide cancer deaths. A small population of cells, termed tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), are important for tumor maintenance, progression and post-treatment recurrence. It is speculated that this specialized population of cells mediates the treatment resistance that is a hallmark of GI malignancy. Reg4 expression is an early event in carcinogenesis in colon, gastric and pancreatic carcinomas and is independently associated with poor clinical outcomes from colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancers. This proposal follows our recent discovery of the Reg4 receptor, and our preliminary data that suggests that it may play an important role in the proliferation and survival of the CSC. Since these pathways are not addressed by existing therapeutics, targeting Reg4-CD44ICD signaling in the stem cell could dramatically change the current treatment paradigm and enhance responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents. This proposal has three Aims; one focused on identification of the CD44 isoforms that can serve as the Reg4 receptor, an experimental Aim focused on examining the role of CD44ICD in the CSC, and a clinical Aim focused on determining the relationship between CD44ICD signaling and clinicopathologic features in colorectal cancer."
"9455681","Project Summary The role of myeloid cells such as neutrophils in providing host defense to microbial infections is well- established; however, the contribution of monocytes/macrophages (M?) to the pathophysiology of bacterial endophthalmitis is less clear. Our preliminary studies revealed that M? depletion results in increased inflammatory mediators at the resolution phase, suggesting their involvement in the resolution of endophthalmitis. The M? perform multiple tasks, including sensing pathogens, tissue repair, and, in response to host-derived mediators, they differentiate into distinct functional phenotypes; a feature termed plasticity. The classically activated M? (M1) produce inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, contributing to host tissue damage. Conversely, the alternatively activated M? (M2) mediate tissue repair through the elimination of damaged cells/tissue and the production of anti-inflammatory molecules to resolve inflammation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms governing the phenotypic switch of M? can be utilized to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Our transcriptome and metabolomics analyses of the bacteria-infected retina directed us to the identification of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic gene, which modulates the infiltrating myeloid cell phenotype in endophthalmitis. We discovered that mice with global deletion (knockout) of AMPK?1 (KO) developed severe endophthalmitis and pathology compared to wild type (WT) mice. M? lacking AMPK?1 maintained a low metabolic state, even in the hyper-inflammatory state. To precisely examine the role of AMPK in myeloid cells, we induced endophthalmitis in myeloid cell specific KO of AMPK?1 (LysM-KO) and observed that LysM-KO displayed exacerbated inflammation and reduced retinal function compared to WT mice, suggesting an essential role of AMPK in myeloid cells in the pathogenesis of bacterial endophthalmitis. Building on these findings, we propose to test our central hypothesis that AMPK exerts protective effects in bacterial endophthalmitis by modulating the polarization of infiltrating monocytes/M? to promote inflammation resolution and that metabolic reprograming is an underlying mechanism of the monocytes/M? phenotype switch. To test our hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanisms underlying reduced AMPK activity in bacterial endophthalmitis by examining the modification of LKB1 via nitrosylation or chemical adduct formation. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that AMPK?1 ablation enhances the activation state of myeloid cells and maintains their proinflammatory (M1) state during the resolution phase of the disease. In Aim 3, we will decipher the bioenergetic events, regulated by AMPK in M?, that polarize and maintain their pro-inflammatory nature. The anticipated results of this study will demonstrate that defective AMPK activity in myeloid cells, mainly in monocytes/M?? impacts the resolution of endophthalmitis via regulation of cellular metabolism. Also, it may provide novel therapeutic targets for the development of anti- inflammatory therapies for endophthalmitis and other microbial infections."

This scientific partnership will employ its diverse expertise to evaluate potential therapies for retinal diseases in animal models by using a cutting-edge systems pharmacology paradigm. By screening a combination of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonist/antagonist drugs (modulators) for their ability to prevent retinal pathology in animal models of various rod and cone photoreceptor cell retinopathies, we will identify suitable candidates for future testing in humans. High resolution imaging methods and transcriptional analysis among other approaches will be used to monitor the efficacy and safety of these combination therapies. The goals of this project are: Aim 1. Test in mice the efficacy of a combination of GPCR agonists/antagonists in protecting against light-induced retinal damage and with either spontaneous rapid or slowly-progressing cone degeneration. Aim 2. Pharmacologically and genetically validate the involvement and specificity of identified GPCRs and their precise subcellular localization using knockin mice with T4 lysosome (T4L) fused into their signaling domains and an antibody we developed against T4L. We also will use the FAST system that allows various genetic outcomes (from inactivation to overexpression) to be engineered in a single mouse model. Aim 3. Assess the effectiveness of GPCR therapy in a canine rod-cone retinopathy model. Aim 4. Expand the range of receptor modulators to include therapeutic antibodies. Fulfilling these interrelated aims will direct our development of more successful therapies for people with incurable blinding diseases."
"9462119","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The immediate goal of our project is to understand the role of the extracellular matrix in retinal development and disease. In prior funding periods, we identified unique isoforms of laminins, containing either the 2 or ?3 chains that are expressed in the eye and brain. Mutations in these two laminin genes, in humans, result in autism, ocular dysgenesis, and kidney dysfunction. Ablation of these genes, in mouse, produce cortical and ocular dysgenesis; the latter includes disruptions of: 1) retinal ganglion cell development; 2) astrocyte migration and subsequent vascular development; 3) the sub-cellular organization of the Mller cell; 4) the photoreceptor- bipolar synapse. Our fundamental hypothesis is that laminins are critical for establishing the three dimensional structure of the retina. Specifically, we hypothesize that laminins provide environmental cues that are essential for angiogenesis and neurogenesis.  Our first aim explores the contributions of laminin signaling in formation of the template for angiogenic development. The working hypothesis is that RGCs drive astrocyte migration; then, interactions between astrocytes and microglia regulate endothelial development. We will use a reverse genetic approach, deleting Lamb2 or Lamc3 genes alone, or together, to disrupt the signaling among these cells. The first set of experiments will focus on the spatial patterning in Lamb2-/- and Lamc3-/- animals. Our second set of experiments will address the role of laminin-mediated recruitment and activation of microglia. The third set of experiments will examine the effectors of laminin signaling in endothelial cells during angiogenesis. Our current data suggest that 2-containing laminins are pro-angiogenic and 3-containing laminins are anti-angiogenic.  Our second aim is focused on the role of laminins in neurogenesis. We will examine the hypothesis that laminin regulates apical-basal polarity of the radially organized progenitor. Our published data demonstrate that Mller cell compartmentalization is disrupted in the Lamb2-/- retina. Moreover, our preliminary data demonstrate that the cell cycle is dysregulated in both Lamb2-/- and Lamc3-/- mice. Our first set of experiments will focus on the regulation of symmetric versus asymmetric division in the Lamb2-/- and Lamc3-/- retina. Next, we will turn to a study of the pattern of inheritance of important cell cycle regulators in these same mice. Last, we will measure directly the cell cycle regulation in Lamb2-/- and Lamc3-/- retina. Our preliminary data suggest that 2- and ?3-containing laminins are necessary to preserve the proliferative state.  Our work is relevant to an understanding of the pathobiology of retinal neovascular disease, gliosis and proliferative vitreoretinopathy because astrocytes and microglia play critical roles in retinal vascularization and remodeling. Our work on retinal progenitor cells will improve our fundamental understanding of retinal development and our understanding of the regulation of the cell cycle in CNS progenitors and will influence the development of 3D culture systems designed to grow retina ex vivo."
"9545304","Project Summary / Abstract Skin exposure to pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus is associated with exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, an inflammatory skin disease affecting approximately 20% of children and 5% of adults in the U.S. The mechanisms by which the S. aureus induces skin inflammation are thought to involve the activation of many different proinflammatory responses. In contrast to this prevailing view, we set out to determine whether there was a predominant mechanism by which S. aureus induced skin inflammation by using an in vivo mouse model of epicutaneous S. aureus exposure. We uncovered a previously unrecognized essential mechanism by which S. aureus skin exposure induced skin inflammation that involved IL-36 cytokine responses. IL-36 cytokines, including IL-36?, IL-36? and IL-36?, are recently identified members of the IL-1 cytokine family. They are expressed by keratinocytes and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis through the induction of IL-17-producing T cells. However, a role for the S. aureus in triggering IL-36 responses has not been reported and thus represents an unexpected mechanism by which the host responds to bacteria on the skin surface to promote cutaneous inflammation. Very little is known about the regulation of IL-36 cytokines, including whether IL-36 cytokines are induced by bacterial virulence factors or host pattern recognition receptors and how IL-36 cytokines regulate T cell responses. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that epicutaneous S. aureus exposure activates keratinocytes to produce IL-36 cytokines (via S. aureus virulence factors and host pattern recognition receptors) that drive skin inflammation by inducing T cell-mediated IL-17 responses. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that IL-36 cytokines are produced by keratinocytes during epicutaneous S. aureus exposure in response to bacterial virulence factors and/or host pattern recognition receptors. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that IL-36-induced IL-17-producing ?? T cells and Th17 cells differentially contribute to S. aureus-induced skin inflammation. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that human keratinocytes produce IL 36 cytokines that induce human ?? and CD4+ T cells to promote skin inflammation in response to S. aureus. To translate our findings to human skin, we will use an in vivo humanized mouse model that possesses matched human grafted skin and human immune cells from the same donors, which is innovative approach to study both human keratinocyte and T cell responses in vivo. Taken together, this proposal will uncover novel mechanisms involving IL-36 responses that promote skin inflammation induced by pathogenic S. aureus bacteria on the surface of the skin. The insights gained in this proposal will provide new mechanisms to target for future immunotherapies to inhibit skin inflammation in atopic dermatitis and potentially other inflammatory skin diseases."
"9453649","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent approval of anti-cancer immunotherapeutic drugs by the FDA validates that stimulation of the immune system of a cancer patient is an effective way to control or prevent metastatic disease. However, the approved immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors are effective only in a subset of melanoma patients, and a majority of the cancer patients do not respond to the drugs. Moreover, cancers such as breast cancers do not respond well to these drugs, suggesting additional immune stimulatory approaches such as therapeutic vaccination need to be developed. One of the major problems in developing vaccination-based immunotherapies for cancer is the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Recent deep gene sequencing studies demonstrated extensive intratumoral and interpersonal heterogeneity in gene mutations in tumors. Therefore, developing a therapeutic vaccine using a single antigen/peptide or patient-derived autologous/allogeneic tumor cell lines, which may not represent the heterogeneity of tumors, would not result in an immune response against the breadth of tumor antigens. Therefore, to induce immunity against the specific antigenic signature of a patient, use of an optimally adjuvanted vaccine based on whole autologous tumor tissue is highly desirable. We have developed an adjuvanted whole tumor tissue based vaccine for cancer immunotherapy using tumor membrane vesicles (TMVs) prepared from whole tumor tissue and modifying them by incorporating immunostimulatory molecules (ISMs) such as B7-1 and IL-12 using a novel protein transfer method. This method immobilizes ISMs onto TMVs via a glycolipid anchor (GPI), resulting in simultaneous delivery of TMVs along with biological adjuvants to APCs for enhanced uptake and optimal immune cell activation. Based on promising preclinical data in mice, Emory University and Metaclipse Therapeutics Corporation have entered into an agreement to advance this immunotherapy approach to clinics targeting triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This subtype of cancer is highly heterogeneous and target antigens vary from patient to patient, thus making it an ideal target for our personalized immunotherapy. Metaclipse was awarded an NIH Phase I SBIR grant to further validate the technology in a TNBC model and is currently conducting studies required for IND filing. In this partnership grant application we propose to: 1) Perform preclinica studies to make recommendations on the use of the TMV-based, patient-specific immunotherapy in combination with standard-of-care treatments, 2) Investigate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the yield and biological activity of the TMV-based immunotherapy prepared from mouse tumor tissue and human tumor tissue derived from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models as well as TNBC patients and 3) Evaluate the TMV-based immunotherapy approach using human TNBC tumor tissue and human GPI-ISMs in a PDX model engrafted with a human immune system. The knowledge obtained from the proposed collaborative studies between Emory University and Metaclipse will aid in designing a clinical trial strategy for TMV-based immunotherapy in TNBC patients."
"9612022","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We previously demonstrated that our early intervention model system, which was centered on using the CSBS to screen all babies at the 1-year check-up as standard of care, resulted in a mean age of 12 months for screening, 14 months for evaluation, and 18 months for treatment participation. These are far younger ages than is common in the U.S. Our 3-stage model system, Get SET (S=Screen; E=Evaluate; T=Treat) Early, screened >10,000 1 year olds in our first trial run1 detecting over 100 ASD and other developmental delayed toddlers. We will build on this highly effective model by implementing a new version in two major cities: San Diego and Phoenix; Los Angeles, Irvine, and Phoenix will provide baseline control data. In Phoenix, we test the feasibility of establishing the Get SET Early model in a city with one of the lowest median incomes and oldest age of first diagnosis in America. In AIM #1, the Screen and Refer Early stage, we will create a Pediatrician Network with 100 members. In San Diego we will utilize our existing Pediatrician Network and test new innovations such as a repeat triple screen at 12, 18, and 24 months to ensure that no toddlers are missed. Speed of referral for evaluation will be compared and contrasted using parent (self) and automatic (referral i- Pad App) options. We will track every toddler with an eventual ASD diagnosis within circumscribed medical groups to determine the true sensitivity and specificity of the screening tool and the percentage of ASD toddlers detected by our model. Anonymous survey data regarding screening habits will be administered to parents and pediatricians. AIM #2 implements the Evaluate and Refer Early stage. Its key attribute is an ASD Early Evaluation Clinic that specializes in the rapid scheduling and evaluation of every referred screened positive toddler. Toddlers will enter the program at the age they fail the screen (i.e., 12, 18 or 24 months) and will be thoroughly diagnostically evaluated and tracked once per year until they turn 3 years. This specialty Clinic is at our Autism Center in San Diego and will be developed at SARRC in Phoenix. Automated versus optional self-referral for treatment will be tested and compared. AIM #3 implements the Treat Early stage. Its key attributes are a network of providers of empirically based treatment and the innovative use of an inexpensive and readily available web-based treatment tracking system to document engagement. Treatment Networks will be created in San Diego and Phoenix. Primary outcome measures include rates and ages of screening and referral, evaluation and referral, and treatment engagement; sustainability across years; diagnostic, clinical and demographic characteristics of subjects; professional and parent satisfaction at each stage. We hypothesize that providing screening tools with clear cut-off scores and guidelines for automatic referral for evaluation and treatment, will result in dramatically lowering mean age of diagnosis and treatment in Phoenix from 4-5 years down to 1-2 years; San Diego will likewise have mean ages of 1-2 years for diagnosis and treatment making them significantly earlier than Los Angeles and Irvine control sites."
"9472206","Project Summary  Animals, including humans, interact with their chemical environment through specialized receptor cells found within the nasal epithelium. Upon odorant binding, these neurons transmit information to the olfactory bulb, the initial site of olfactory sensory processing. However, at present, our understanding of how these cells ultimately communicate information about odor identity and concentration to the brain in intact animals is limited. I propose that olfactory receptor neurons are a highly diverse population of cells in terms of their odor responses within a sampling event. Furthermore, heterogeneous activity among receptor neurons may be a mechanism to preserve non-redundant information about the sensory environment. Aim 1 will examine how populations of olfactory receptor neurons encode odor mixtures. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that individual olfactory receptor neurons heterogeneously respond to odors. Together, these aims will provide novel insights into mechanisms of sensory transduction in the mammalian olfactory system."
"9475080","Overall Project Summary/Abstract Cancer is an evolutionary and ecological phenomenon driven by the fundamental forces of evolution: mutations, natural selection and genetic drift. It provides a classic example of multi-level selection. At the level of individual cancer cells, selection favors neoplastic proliferation; at the level of the host organism, selection favors cancer suppression. A full understanding of cancer hinges on an appreciation of this fundamental tension. Regulatory mechanisms at the organismal level determine evolutionary parameters at the cell level such as the somatic mutation rate and response to DNA damage. Cancer circumvents those constraints and changes the parameters of cell-level evolution, leading to malignancy and eventual host death. Thus, organismal and cell-level evolution feedback upon each other. To paraphrase Dobzhansky, nothing in cancer biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. This opens an opportunity. We may apply evolutionary and ecological theory to neoplastic progression and response to therapy. The mission of the Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center (ACE) is to advance our fundamental understanding of cancer and its clinical management through the development and application of evolutionary and ecological models to cancer biology. This mission spans scales from the evolution of cancer suppression mechanisms and cancer susceptibility across species (Project 1) down to the evolution of normal somatic cells (Project 2) and populations of cancer cells (Project 3). Project 1 will develop models of organismal evolution to predict cancer rates and cancer defenses across species. We will test those predictions using veterinary databases of cancer incidence in over 1,900 animal species, and examine the genomes of 57 mammalian species for evidence of adaptations to the selective pressure of cancer. In addition, Project 2 will test Project 1's model predictions of cancer defenses in primary cells from those same 57 mammalian species. Project 2 will also measure the fundamental forces of evolution in normal colonic and small intestine tissue from humans, mice and elephants to address a basic but poorly understood property of cancer: tissue-level differences in cancer susceptibility. Project 3 will develop novel evolutionary and ecological indices, based on models of cell-level evolution in neoplasms from Project 1, to predict long term therapeutic response and patient survival in stage 2&3, chemo- nave colorectal cancers. These indices will provide, for the first time, a classification system that the community can use to draw distinctions between tumors with different evolutionary dynamics, and thereby provide a foundation for the clinical management of this evolving disease. ACE will support the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium and the growing field of evolution and cancer by providing data, analytical tools, models, workshops, and tutorials to facilitate the use of those resources."
"9512656","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Objectives: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. There is a large and growing population of Veterans undergoing the lung cancer evaluation process, often as a result of detection of a pulmonary nodule. This growth is fueled by several factors. First, many Veterans are at substantial risk of developing lung cancer because of a smoking history and military and environmental exposures to carcinogens such as asbestos and Agent Orange. Second, the number of patients with incidentally-detected pulmonary nodules is sizable as a result of the burgeoning use of thoracic radiologic imaging. Third, and most importantly, lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has begun and it is estimated that 7 million US adults and 1 million Veterans may be eligible. A recent study of lung cancer screening using LDCT, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), showed lung cancer and overall mortality reductions of 20% and 7%, respectively. Based on this benefit, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and other organizations recommend consideration of annual CT screening for people who meet NLST eligibility criteria. Accordingly, the VA's National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP) initiated the Lung Cancer Screening Clinical Demonstration Project (LCSCDP). Pulmonary nodules are very commonly detected on chest imaging studies. The VA Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS) has utilized a pulmonary nodule registry for several years. In 2013, 1020 of the 3256 Veterans with a chest CT were identified in the registry. Our ability to provide Veteran-centered lung cancer screening and pulmonary nodule care is hindered by several gaps in our understanding of the nodule evaluation process. First, there are limited studies regarding the risk that a nodule will be diagnosed as lung cancer. Increased understanding of patient and radiologic characteristics that are associated with a higher risk of lung cancer will guide shared decision-making. Second, there is currently no mechanism to use administrative data to identify patients with pulmonary nodules because of a lack of a well-accepted diagnostic code. This information gap substantially hinders the ability of researchers, clinicians, and administrators to efficiently evaluate future screening interventions. Plan: For this proposal, we will conduct a comprehensive review of patients from established pulmonary nodule registries at the VAPORHCS and VISN 23 in order to address these knowledge gaps. These registries are linked to other routinely-collected administrative data and are currently clinically used to track patients with nodules. Taking advantage of these registries will allow us to not only answer key questions in the care delivery of patients with pulmonary nodules, but also enable us to build and refine the building blocks that will serve as the foundation for lung cancer screening implementation. Our Aims were directly informed by VA's strategic goals with specific patient and partner questions in mind. Methods: Aim 1: Develop and validate a predictive model of lung cancer risk among a cohort of Veterans with incidentally-detected pulmonary nodules. Rationale: A prognostic model would enable clinicians and patients to improve counseling and access to knowledge by providing personalized, Veteran-centric care outside of specialty settings. Aim 2: Develop and validate an algorithm based on routinely collected clinical data to identify Veterans with a pulmonary nodule diagnosis. Rationale: There is no mechanism to identify patients with pulmonary nodules using routinely collected data. Developing a coding algorithm to identify these patients, using established nodule registries as criterion standards, will enable scientists to perform comparative effectiveness research and give clinicians and administrators access to higher quality data than currently available."
"9449475","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to investigate the functions of schizophrenia-associated genes using zebrafish as a model system. Large-scale genome-wide association studies have begun to uncover numerous candidate genes linked to schizophrenia. Yet it remains unclear how these genes function and how they contribute to the underlying molecular, cellular, developmental and behavioral processes disrupted in the disorder. Recent technological breakthroughs in zebrafish ? targeted genome editing, whole-brain activity imaging, brain atlas registration, behavioral profiling ? combined with the ease of studying large numbers of animals make it an ideal system for analyzing psychiatric disease genes. Preliminary studies led to the creation of zebrafish mutants for 96 schizophrenia-associated genes. Characterization of 59 of these mutants for altered brain anatomy and activity has revealed 27 mutants with phenotypical abnormalities. In particular, ZNF536, a schizophrenia-associated transcription factor, was found to be involved in the development of GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the forebrain and cerebellum as well as regulate locomotion. During the K99 phase, this project will complete the analysis of mutant brain anatomy. In addition, all mutants will be tested for behavioral abnormalities, including motor behaviors associated with schizophrenia, such as defective prepulse inhibition (Aim 1). In parallel, the developmental roles of ZNF536 will be studied to test the hypothesis that this transcription factor is responsible for the development of GABAergic neurons, and that its loss results in the de-inhibition of downstream circuits. To define the molecular mechanisms by which ZNF536 exerts its effects, ZNF536 target genes will be isolated (Aim 2). Similar in-depth characterization of other interesting genes will be undertaken in the R00 phase to discover additional pathways regulated by schizophrenia-associated genes. Understanding the molecular, cellular, developmental and behavioral processes regulated by schizophrenia- associated genes will provide the foundation to understand the causes of schizophrenia and develop new diagnostics and therapies."
"9548975","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and its animal model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; EAE) are autoimmune disorders of the CNS, and are considered to be mediated by myelin reactive T helper cells (TH1, TH2, Treg and TH17). The present proposal is to investigate S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)-mediated immuno- modulation and neuroprotection/neurorepair mechanisms in EAE disease models based on our novel finding that: 1) GSNO attenuated disease in three different EAE disease models; SJL mice immunized with PLP139-151, C57BL/6 mice immunized with MOG35-55, and Lewis rats immunized with MBP; 2) GSNO inhibited TH17 polarization/effector functions and induced Treg polarization/effector functions without obvious effects on TH1 and TH2; 3) GSNO-mediated post-translational modification of STAT3 (S-nitrosylation at Cys259) inhibited STAT3 activation which plays a critical role in TH17/Treg polarization/effector functions and disease progression of EAE/MS; 4) GSNO inhibited NFkappaB activity and iNOS expression which play a critical role in oxidative/nitrosative damage of the CNS under inflammatory conditions;.5) GSNO induced astroglial expression of neurotrophic factors that play a critical role in the neurorepair process. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that GSNO-mediated mechanisms attenuate the EAE/MS disease by S-nitrosylation and inhibition of STAT3 and also promote neuroprotection and neurorepair processes in EAE by attenuation of NFkappaB/iNOS-mediated nitrosative/oxidative stress while still supporting cellular requirements for GSNO/NO with supplementation of GSNO. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis by investigating the role of GSNO in TH17/Treg polarization and neuroprotection/neurorepair processes and in EAE disease processes using genetic (iNOS knockout and GSNO reductase knock mice) as well as pharmacological approaches by using inhibitor of GSNO reductase (N6022) to increase endogenous GSNO and by supplementation of exogenous GSNO. Cellular homeostasis of GSNO is maintained by its redox based synthesis from GSH and NO and its enzymatic inactivation/degradation primarily by GSNO reductase (GSNOR). The proposed studies are: Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of exogenous vs. endogenous GSNO on Treg/TH17 specific immunomodulation in an active EAE disease model. Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of exogenous vs. endogenous GSNO on Treg/TH17 specific immunomodulation in the adoptive transfer passive EAE disease model. Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the efficacy of GSNO on neuroprotection and neurorepair in the EAE disease model. The novelty of the study is the promise of new therapeutic targets for TH17-mediated immune response and neuroprotection (protection of blood brain barrier and CNS) and promotion of neurorepair without affecting natural immuno-surveillance mechanisms mediated by other TH cells (e.g. TH1 and TH2). We expect that study of the S-nitrosylation-based regulatory mechanisms of TH17/Treg polarization/effector functions and neuroprotection/neurorepair in EAE disease will not only delineate the NO/GSNO mediated mechanisms in autoimmune disease, but also its clinical relevance as novel NO based therapeutics either alone or in combination with approved drug for MS. GSNO is a natural component of the human body and its exogenous administration in humans was not associated with any adverse effects. Therefore, potential use of GSNO by itself or in combination with present day medications as a translational drug for MS is promising and highly relevant to Veterans' health and the VA mission."
"9505570","Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ?eld typically produce an ?all-cause? risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest ? at best ? reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modi?able risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classi?cation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signi?cantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs."

The UA SRP Research Translation Core drives this effort through dedicated interactions with our stakeholders to ensure that the key strengths and accomplishments, and the research results and implications, of the UA SRP are appreciated and applied. A major divide often exists between the generation of cutting-edge research and putting the findings into practice. Thus, a critical part of the research process is ensuring effective translation of evidence-based information and innovative research products to end-users for application. The UA SRP Research Translation team acts as a knowledge broker to build partnerships and exchange information between UA SRP scientific experts and those who are impacted by hazardous waste. These stakeholders include communities, decision-makers, practitioners, industry, as well as other academics and the NIEHS. The UA SRP Research Translation Core has been designed to effectively integrate and translate UA SRP findings on the impacts of hardrock mining sites and mining activities on human health and the environment through four key areas of Research Translation: 1) Communicating within the Superfund Research Program community, focusing on facilitating investigator-initiated research translation, reporting activities to SRP staff at NIEHS, and cross-center communication; 2) Building government partnerships and transdisciplinary teams to engage in constructive, collaborative partnerships and to build upon previous experiences in order to cultivate additional long-term partnerships with government agencies; 3) Technology transfer to identify opportunities and delineate mechanisms to transfer UA SRP research advances in biomedical and environmental science and engineering technologies into health intervention and site characterization and remediation tools; and 4) Information dissemination to other end-users which will involve using a variety of traditional and innovative approaches to transfer the knowledge gained from the Center's project activities to make as broad an impact as possible. We will use a variety of measures to assess our success, and to ensure that we are meeting our goal of effective research translation. Through these activities, we will serve our stakeholders by acting as a neutral party to provide evidence-based information on contaminants such as arsenic and other metal(loids), mining, and other potential hazards, and their impacts on human health and the environment."
"9460498","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inhibitory interneurons of the visual cortex powerfully shape the responses of their target cells. As our knowledge of cortical inhibitory neuron types has grown, it has become clear that they participate in inhibitory as well as disinhibitory circuit, and are influenced by bottom-up as well as top-down inputs. The individual and collective responses of neurons in successive stages of cortical processing are also shaped by contextual influences, and are crucially modulated by task-dependent behavior. The goal of this proposal is to reveal mechanisms of excitatory-inhibitory interactions and their role in contextual modulation in visual cortex, using a range of approaches that include unique mouse lines, cell-specific targeted recordings, high-density 2-photon calcium imaging of 3-dimensional volumes, novel optogenetic probes and paradigms, specific control of modulatory systems, and behavioral paradigms coupled with dissection of area-specific neuronal responses.  We hypothesize that inhibitory circuits can dynamically regulate both the amplitude and the timing of cortical activity depending on behavioral context. To clarify the functional impact of different inhibitory neuron classes on the amplitude of responses in their target pyramidal cells, we will use a novel single-pulse optogenetic probe. Our hypothesis is that temporal coactivation of these neurons and their target cells dynamically dictates their function within intact circuits (Aim 1). Additionally, many inhibitory subtypes express receptors for acetylcholine (ACh), a neuromodulator known to strongly affect visual cortical activity during behavior, leading to changes in the timing of population activity: desynchronization in the local field potential and reduced correlation between neurons, which together improve coding of visual stimuli. We will use targeted in vivo and slice recordings in combination with optogenetic techniques in specific mouse lines to investigate both the effects of ACh on defined interneuron types, as well as the causal role of these cell types in mediating cholinergic effects on cortical processing (Aim 2). Changes in both response amplitude and timing have also been proposed to improve sensory processing during attention-demanding behavior. We will develop a visual discrimination task for mice and use large-scale (>1000 neurons simultaneously) 2-photon calcium imaging to measure neural responses during performance of the task (engaged) or during passive viewing of the same stimuli (passive) (Aim 3). Using specific mouse lines, we will measure responses from identified excitatory and inhibitory populations, from primary visual and posterior parietal cortex as well as from cholinergic axons in the visual cortex. We will investigate cell-specific changes in firing rate, between-neuron correlations, and between-trial reliability as a function of behavioral engagement. Together, these experiments should provide fundamental information on the circuits and pathways by which contextual influences shape cortical processing, and reveal mechanisms relevant to dysfunction in a wide range of brain disorders."
"9495737","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Estrogen receptors are the primary regulators of gene function in female reproductive tissues. They do so by recruiting a series of 'coregulators' (coactivators to activate genes, or corepressors to repress genes). Most coregulators are enzymes and many of them are recruited simultaneously to form large complexes bound to a receptor at a given target gene. We know a great deal about the production of the hormone (estrogen) and a good deal about the estrogen receptor. However, much less is known about the complement of coactivators that bind to receptor at a specific target gene. For instance, what specific relative roles the DNA sequence, the posttranslational modifications of the associated proteins, and the compositions of histones play in activating its target gene. We feel we can best contribute specific new information to these questions by studying direct formation of the 'active receptor-coactivator' complexes in vitro, under conditions where we can control the compositions and posttranslational modifications of the components in the complex - all under conditions where we can monitor the final outcome activation of transcriptional expression of the gene into messenger RNA. We plan to approach these questions using biochemical, physical structural and cell-based methodologies. We have developed within the project a means (Cryo-EM) to 'directly visualize' and model the receptor-coactivator complexes that we form in vitro. When we define the DNA bound receptor- complex of coactivators and the histone marks, we then use this information to understand the roles of these molecular reactions in disease states such as reproductive tissue inflammatory diseases and reproductive tissue cancers. When we determine a critical coactivator or histone mark that allows a disease process gene to function aberrantly, we next search for small molecule drugs that will inhibit/activate this molecular targe to favor therapy for the pathology in question. When the cell-free and whole cell studies indicate therapeutic possibilities for a new drug for a disease (e.g., breast cancer), we then test the drug in standard animal models. In preliminary studies described in our grant proposal, we demonstrate this roadmap to therapy can be used successfully to uncover new therapeutic drugs for given diseases of reproductive and oncogenic tissues."
"9471873","ABSTRACT Veterinarian-scientists provide critical disciplinary and technical expertise for advancing biomedical research. Due to their broad understanding of animal anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and disease, they possess key knowledge for cross-species comparative medicine and for experimentally-induced and naturally occurring animal models of human diseases. Veterinarian-scientists also provide contributions to human welfare through critical roles in One Health initiatives, including in global food security and in emerging and zoonotic diseases. Of importance is that approximately 75% of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are diseases of animal origin. However, the US National Research Council, an NIH Physician-Scientist Workforce Working Group Report, and the NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs have all emphasized that the veterinarian-scientist workforce is far underrepresented and underutilized in biomedical research. Reasons for this include limited access by veterinary students to biomedical research programs and appropriate training. The objective of our ?Veterinary Summer Scholars in Comparative Medicine? T35 training program is to provide direct biomedical research experiences to first and second-year veterinary students to increase the numbers of researchers in the veterinary-scientist pipeline. Our approach will consist of 1) providing opportunities to conduct biomedical research in an environment of collaboration and discovery provided by mentors who are basic and clinical-scientists, and 2) providing research training in the form of lectures and discussions focused on responsible conduct and ethics in research, experimental design and quality assurance, research communication, and career pathways in the biomedical sciences. New innovations described in this renewal application include increased opportunities for continued research experiences during veterinary school, as well as interprofessional interactions by our veterinary students with other health professionals to promote team-science. The proposed T35 training program involves a critical mass of faculty mentors from our comprehensive Academic Health Center at the University of Minnesota for providing multidisciplinary and state-of-the-art research experiences."
"9459369","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of our work is to advance the development of high-resolution epiretinal prosthetic devices for treating incurable blindness from retinal degeneration. We approach this by developing novel techniques for high-resolution, multi-electrode stimulation of retinal ganglion cells in the isolated retina, as a laboratory platform for developing the necessary approaches for restoring vision. The major goals of this project are to (1) develop methods to detect and avoid the unintended activation of axon bundles that corrupts the artificial image, (2) develop methods to efficiently stimulate specific cells and cell types while avoiding stimulation of other cells, and (3) develop spatiotemporally patterned stimulation and high-density recording and stimulation for use in the central retina, which is necessary for high-resolution vision. Tackling these aims is anticipated to support the development of a device that can emulate the neural code of the retina, cell-by-cell and spike-by-spike, over a substantial area. The unique technical approach employed involves large-scale, high-resolution electrical recording and stimulation, combined with novel analysis, imaging, and computational approaches to optimize the artificial visual signal. Our vision is that this work will aid the design of the next generation of retinal prosthetic devices to support advanced visual functions, such as object recognition and motion sensing, in human patients."
"9615448","Abstract/Project Summary This proposed supplement expands the commercialization and market assessment activities for the original Phase I grant through the Innovation-CORPs Program at NIH. The expected primary benefit from I-Corps is having dedicated time and mentored direction towards relevant interviews in the endoscopic space; this is expected to provide invaluable information about the needs, in-depth technical knowledge, the market players, and acquisition process for endoscopic accessories and minimally invasive surgery in healthcare facilities. Though AMI has experience in the space with respect to feeding tubes, a significant focus for the company has been to get involved more in the gastrointestinal surgical space. The I-Corps program would help jumpstart the limited exposure so far achieved. Additionally, it is expected that updates from other companies in the program will provide a different perspective on both interview logistics and approach to commercialization. AMI has always been an agile company when evaluating commercial markets and strategies, and welcomes the opportunity to modify/refine the commercialization strategy to improve the successful launch of the Flexible Pancreatic Ablation (FPA) system. It is recognized that needs, technologies, and regulations are dynamic, and as AMI has in the past changed its approach to commercialization ? such as emerging markets in TubeClear or modifying hardware designs to better adapt to new FDA regulations ? it is prepared to do so in this program. Original Project abstract: This Phase I SBIR develops and tests feasibility of the FPA system to endoscopically treat pancreatic tumors. The FPA deploys through an endoscope and into heterogeneous pancreatic tissue with a vibrating head consisting of an array of fine, flexible tines that expand into a predetermined shape. The vibration and geometry of the tines improve tissue penetration and trajectory accuracy to enable complete tumor ablation without destroying healthy tissue. Public Health Problem: Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease with poor prognosis and short survival. Although it accounts for 3% of new cancer cases overall each year ? an occurrence nearly 80% less than breast cancer ? the estimated number of deaths in 2016 surpassed that of breast cancer, making it the third most deadly cancer (41,780 estimated deaths) in the U.S. This is due in part to its typically late stage diagnosis, which limits eligibility for the preferred treatment of surgical resection to only 20% of patients. Resection is preferred because other percutaneous methods such as laparoscopy using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have shown similar risks but lower efficacy due to anatomical obstructions and surgical route. Endoscopic techniques are advancing, but are so far limited in scope or capabilities. RFA needles generate set ellipsoidal ablation zones which may not match the shape of tumors. Unlike other organs, damaged pancreatic tissue cannot regenerate; therefore, healthy tissue must be preserved if possible. The pancreatic tissue heterogeneity can also complicate procedures with lengthy, thin, flexible ablation probes ? soft structures can compress and relax, resulting in uncertainty in insertion depth, and harder structures can resist piercing and redirect the probe path. An advanced endoscopic accessory is needed that can fully ablate pancreatic tumors while minimizing patient complications and destruction of healthy tissue ? and provide an effective treatment choice for the 80% of patients with limited options for survival. Phase I Hypothesis. Feasibility of improved endoscopic therapy of pancreatic cancer is demonstrated by deployment of tines and production of spherical ablation zones using the FPA tool in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aims: Aim 1 ? Develop FPA handheld prototype and demonstrate improved FPA effector expansion with vibration. Acceptance Criteria: FPA maintains desired effector expansion and reduction-of-force with vibration in all endoscopic phantom insertions. Aim 2 ? Show efficacy of tissue ablation in vitro and insertion testing in heterogeneous models. Acceptance Criteria: Validate thermal models and demonstrate improved lesion shape to needle ablation in vitro. Demonstrate effective deployment in heterogeneous tissues. Aim 3 ? Endoscopic demonstration of ablation zone in pancreas using FPA in preliminary preclinical study. Acceptance Criteria: In vivo (N=3) ablation volume is within 20% of simulations. No adverse effects from ablation procedure during 7-day survival."
"9462208","Abstract Heart failure (HF) expenditure amounts to several billion per year. Despite advances in medical treatment of HF, mortality after HF onset and rate of recurrent HF decompensation remain high, underscoring an urgent need to identify effective prevention strategies. Observational studies showed a higher risk of death in HF patients with lower levels of vitamin D and two recent post-hoc analyses of trials conducted in mostly post- menopausal women reported a reduction in HF rates in the vitamin D group compared with placebo. Vitamin D has also been reported to improve hemodynamics and left ventricular remodeling in 229 HF patients. However, no randomized trial has examined the effects of vitamin D on primary prevention of HF or on the rate of recurrent HF decompensation in men and women. Efficacy of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on cardiovascular events has been reported in trials with low prevalence of stain use only. EPA/DHA can reduce risk factors for HF including myocardial infarction, hypertension, and diabetes. While some but not all observational studies have suggested an inverse association between EPA/DHA and the incidence of HF, no large primary prevention trial of EPA/DHA on HF has been conducted. In addition, effect modification of the effects of EPA/DHA on HF by statin has not been elucidated. This project will investigate the effects of vitamin D and EPA/DHA supplements on the incidence rate of HF and on recurrent HF decompensation in an ancillary study of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an NIH-funded randomized controlled trial of 25,874 men and women testing the efficacy of 2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol and 1 g/day EPA/DHA on cardiovascular disease and cancer endpoints."
"9555559","Abstract Neonates with high bilirubin levels can develop a fatal disorder known as Kernicterus. Kernicterus has a death rate of 2-3% and causes brain damage and serious long-term complications. High bilirubin levels are the leading cause for readmission of newborns to the hospital in the first 2 weeks of life. Current laboratory analyzers require a venipuncture for neonates, which is difficult for the care-provider, patient and parent. ?With the onset of illness, it is not uncommon for neonates lose 15-30% of circulating blood volume to laboratory testing.? A NICHD workshop on NICUs concluded that there is a urgent need for metabolic analysis methods that require minimal volumes of blood, can measure analytes in parallel, and are accurate, reliable, and cost-effective (Raju, 2009). A recent report by Market Research Future, states that by 2024 the Bilirubin Testing market will reach 2.5 billion dollars. In Vitro Diagnostic Solutions (IVDS) proposes the development of the first and only point-of-care (POC) system, the ?BiliNow?, for the determination of bilirubins from a finger or heel-stick. The ?BiliNow? will be used in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), emergency room (ER), intensive care units (ICU) and clinician?s office providing immediate feedback to expedite treatment. The BiliNow utilizes a microfluidic chip format that is minimally invasive, requiring only 30 microliters of whole blood, which is collected from a heel-stick or fingerstick. In Phase I studies, we will: 1) Test solubilizing agents to ensure complete solubility of unconjugated bilirubin; 2) Test and eliminate hematocrit bias in the neonatal range of 32 to 60%; 3) and finally, Evaluate a dose response of bilirubin with whole blood samples. Microchips will be dosed and dried with chromophore-sensors specific for conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. Whole blood will be spiked with each conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, over the analytical ranges. Plasma will be separated, in-situ, and the end-color of each sensing-well will be quantitated using percent reflectance and calculated mg/dL, via a hand-held, portable analyzer, similar to the glucose model. The BiliNow provides results for both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin in a single step within 3 minutes. The BiliNow technology has a clear advantage in the neonatal blood chemistry market as no other device can measure bilirubin, from a single drop of blood. Upon successful completion of the Phase I Aims, Phase II will focus on optimization of the platform to ensure linearity and precision, establish intra-day and inter-day precision under Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, and evaluate preclinical samples with the BiliNow comparing results against an FDA approved method, the Br2 analyzer."
"9582448","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Physically active individuals have a 20% - 30% reduced risk of developing colon cancer compared with sedentary individuals. Mechanisms to explain the relationship are not established, and little is known about the effects of exercise at the cellular level in humans. Observational data suggests that low levels of physical activity are associated with DNA hypermethylation of specific genes in blood, but there is a lack of research on either the direct effects of exercise on DNA methylation in target tissue (colon), or on the amount of exercise necessary to effect these changes. Aberrant DNA methylation of certain genes has been identified in the normal colon of people at risk for colon cancer and appears to reflect a ?field cancerization? process, whereby the normal colon is primed for carcinogenesis. Previous research assessed DNA methylation levels using established techniques that were unable to detect low levels. This application is in response to NCI PA-15-163 Exploratory/Developmental Clinical Research Grants in Obesity (R21) which invites grant applications that focus on biomarker effects of weight control methods such as physical activity. Using a novel method that we have developed (MethyLight droplet digital PCR, ddPCR), which accurately detects low levels of DNA methylation in normal colon tissue, we propose to investigate the effects of a 12-month exercise intervention on DNA methylation in 4 candidate genes linked to field cancerization in the colon (EVL, MGMT, p14, and ESR1). Sigmoid colon samples were collected at baseline in 202 initially sedentary men and women aged 40-75 years. Participants were randomized to moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise (facility and home, goal 360 minutes/week) intervention (N=51 men, 49 women) or control (no change in exercise; N=51 men, 51 women). In the exercise group, mean exercise over 12 months was 370 min/wk in men (102% of goal) and 295 min/wk in women (82% of goal). 12 month sigmoid colon biopsies were obtained in 187 (93%) [N=48 men, N=43 women in the exercise group, and N=48 men and 48 women in the control group]. Primary analyses will test the intervention effect (intent-to-treat) on levels of DNA methylation of the 4 target genes. Secondary analyses will address effect modification by dose of exercise, weight change and fat mass change (measured by DXA). Exploratory analyses will address: 1) effect modification by sex, colorectal adenoma history, family history of colon cancer, intake of folate and B vitamins; and 2) correlations between baseline DNA methylation of the 4 candidate genes with colon crypt proliferation and apoptosis. The proposed research is highly novel, takes advantage of an existing resource, and will inform future trials testing effects of different types and doses of exercise on genome-wide DNA methylation."
"9542935","Project Summary/Abstract  Miscarriage is the most common pregnancy outcome, and can have lasting psychological implications that persist even after the birth of a healthy child. The few treatment options that exist are costly, potentially invasive, undermine quality of life, or are associated with adverse sequelae. Aspirin is a well-tolerated over- the-counter drug, but little is known about its effects on promoting live birth in women at high risk of recurrent miscarriage. The Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) study was a randomized trial of the effect of low-dose aspirin on preventing miscarriage and promoting live birth. While the study found a small effect of aspirin on live birth, interpreting these results is complicated by several challenges that routinely affect randomized trials. These include failure of study participants to comply with the assigned treatment, mis- measurement of exposure to aspirin, and studying aspirin effects in a sample that is not representative of the population of interest. Each of these creates the potential for incorrect inferences regarding treatment effects in more general populations. We will reanalyze data from this prospective cohort study using tools that properly account for each of these complications. Specifically, we will (Aim 1) estimate the effect of taking daily low dose aspirin on miscarriage and successful live birth; (Aim 2) correct these effects estimates for potential measurement error; and (Aim 3) generalize these effect estimates to clinically representative populations. Successful completion of this work will fill critical gaps in knowledge about the benefits of aspirin in preventing miscarriage and promoting live birth. Our cost-effective, efficient, and methodologically innovative project will help guide clinicians and public health practitioners in making informed decisions about this simple and inexpensive preventive strategy. Furthermore, by developing and disseminating our project's methods and software programs, we will facilitate the widespread use of our state-of-the-art analytic techniques to account for common problems in the analysis of randomized trials. Consequently, the impact of this project will be wide, and will enable researchers in any substantive area to fully address critical issues that plague nearly all trials in the biomedical and social sciences."
"9524087","This project generates, validates, and delivers novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that are designed to selectively and potently eradicate chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in the U.S., without affecting healthy cells and tissues. CLL is an indolent yet incurable B-cell malignancy that afflicts more than 150,000 men and women and causes more than 4,500 deaths per year in the U.S. alone. There are currently no treatment options for CLL that allow for selective targeting of malignant B cells and that spare healthy B cells and other healthy cells and tissues. With this Premise, the project is built on the Hypothesis that the Fc receptor FCMR, on its own or in combination with other selectively expressed CLL cell surface antigens, can mediate rapid and effective cellular entry of cytotoxic drugs for potent and specific therapeutic intervention. Two independent Specific Aims will be pursued to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, a series of molecularly defined ADCs will be generated that deliver and release a highly cytotoxic tubulin inhibitor and a highly cytotoxic DNA-targeting drug, on their own or in combination, via the FCMR internalization and trafficking pathway. These ADCs will be based on the selenomab-drug conjugate platform which utilizes an engineered selenocysteine residue for site-specific drug conjugation. By extensive validation in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, a panel of FCMR-targeting selenomab-drug conjugates will be assessed for their stability, specificity, potency, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics. Aim 2 builds on a novel dual variable domain (DVD)-IgG1- based ADC platform that utilizes a unique reactive lysine residue for site-specific drug conjugation. DVD-IgM- based ADCs that can simultaneously engage FCMR and a second CLL cell surface antigen will be built and extensively validated. In addition to a highly modular research strategy that systematically compares different targets, different antibodies, different antibody formats, different linkers, and different drugs, the ex vivo and in vivo experiments in both Specific Aims will be based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from male and female CLL patients rather than on cell lines to collectively achieve Robust and Unbiased Results toward delivering a candidate for advanced preclinical investigations and eventual clinical translation. Throughout this campaign, conceptually novel biological and chemical components with broad applicability to next-generation ADCs for cancer therapy will be developed."
"9605049","The computational properties of the human brain arise from an intricate interplay between billions of neurons connected in complex networks. However, our ability to study these networks in healthy human brain is limited by the necessity to use noninvasive technologies. This is in contrast to animal models where a rich, detailed view on the cellular level brain function has become available due to recent advances in microscopic optical imaging and genetics. Thus, a central challenge facing neuroscience today is leveraging these mechanistic insights from animal studies to accurately draw physiological inferences from human noninvasive signals. In the proposed project, we focus on the ?Calibrated? Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI technology asking the questions: ?Which aspects of the underlying neuronal activity can be reliably inferred from noninvasive cerebral blood flow (CBF) and Cerebral Metabolic Rate of O2 (CMRO2) observables?? and ?What further information can be obtained from combining Calibrated BOLD with Magnetoencephalography (MEG)?? Our central hypothesis is that specific neuronal cell types have identifiable ?signatures? in the way they drive changes in energy metabolism (CMRO2), blood flow (CBF) and contribute to macroscopic electrical signals (MEG current dipole dynamics). Because other factors may affect baseline flow and metabolism, our focus is on the evoked absolute CMRO2 and CBF changes associated with increased or decreased neuronal activity. We will perform parallel experiments in mice and humans to empirically connect the dots between the microscopic properties of brain's functional organization and their manifestation on the macroscopic level of noninvasive observables. Based on the experimental results, we will then develop a computational framework that will establish connections between scales and measurement modalities enabling robust estimation of the critical aspects of neuronal circuit activity from noninvasive measurements in humans. The proposed project will deliver a quantitative probe for neuronal activity of known cell types in human brain enabling a paradigm shift in human fMRI studies: from a simple mapping of fMRI signal change to the explicit estimation of the respective activity levels of specific neuronal cell types without confounding effects of the baseline state of flow and metabolism.

"9502064","More than 65% of patients with blast-related and non-blast-related traumatic brain injuries report vision problems. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) related visual impairment can damage not only the eye, but the visual (sensory and ocular-motor) pathways and/or cortical processing areas. Thus, the traditional objectives and treatment plans for eye-related blindness or low-vision may not be appropriate for combat and TBI related vision injuries. In 2008, the Veteran Health Administration (VHA) published Directive 2008-065 titled ?Performance of Traumatic Brain Injury Specific Ocular Health and Visual Functioning Examinations for Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center Patients? specifying that all patients with a diagnosis of TBI who are admitted to VHA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers (PRCs) have a TBI-specific ocular health and visual functioning examination performed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Several studies have identified the prevalence and symptomology of this cohort; however, the service delivery data generated by this mandated exam have not been analyzed. The purposed study will evaluate how a selected attempt to organize the structure of care (Directive 2008-065) affects access to and utilization of vision health care services. The Specific Aims are to (1) Determine the pattern of access to and utilization of services among Veterans with TBI with visual and ocular deficits; (2) Describe rehabilitation service delivery; and (3) Explore clinical recovery as measured by visual and ocular outcomes. This population-based study will use a retrospective cohort design with a prospective survey component to identify access barriers to follow up appointments. The population is defined as all Veterans and active duty service persons with TBI admitted to one of the five VHA PRCs (approximate n=2,500). Patient identifiers (both Veteran and active duty) are provided by the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation National Program Office. Using the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure workspace, both structured and unstructured data will be used to create an analytic data set. Structured data will be extracted from relevant data tables from the Corporate Data Warehouse. Unstructured data will be extracted from text documents stored in the electronic health record, also housed in the Corporate Data Warehouse, using an Information Extraction system. Extraction methods include manual chart review by experts, natural language processing, named entity recognition, machine learning and ad-hoc methods like handcrafted rules or regular expressions. Extracted data will be validated by an Expert Panel composed of oculomotor and vision experts from each of the five PRCs, the Polytrauma System of Care, and pre-911 vision and blind services clinics. Geographic Information System tools will be used to determine geographic access (both drive distance and drive time) to health services. The final dataset will consist of diverse variables including patient characteristics, treatment recommendations, access factors, facility locations, clinic visits, treatments/assistive devices, and patient-level outcomes with substantial inter- dependencies among the variables, all of which are interrelated in a complex non-linear fashion. Frequentist and Bayesian Network methods will be used to analyze data. The impact of this study on Veterans and the VHA system of care will be the development of recommendations to improve community reintegration by improving access to and utilization of quality TBI-related vision services. This will be accomplished by translating PRC specialized knowledge to non-specialized VHA facilities closer to the patients' residences."
"9462726","PROJECT ONE SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Early identification of prodromes in neurodegenerative diseases is of great importance for understanding the course of and potential for interventions in progressive cognitive change. Prodromal Alzheimer's disease may manifest in multiple cognitive domains, including memory or executive deficits, making it difficult to distinguish from other prodromal pathophysiologies such as frontotemporal dementia. This project addresses this difficulty by combining structural and functional markers of network integrity with novel measures of white matter disruption using the recently developed NIH Human Connectome Project scanner. This state-of-the-art instrument was developed for high fidelity imaging of the integrity of white matter fiber tracts, but also allows conventional imaging. These technical advantages are leveraged by the project aims. The project focus is on subjects with subjective cognitive concerns or mild cognitive impairment exhibiting a phenotype of predominant executive dysfunction or of predominant memory deficits. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that these two cognitive phenotypes will be associated with structural and functional connectivity measures of the integrity in different networks. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that novel measures of white matter integrity using diffusion imaging on the Connectome Project scanner will improve sensitivity to early impairments in the these two cognitive phenotypes when paired with the structural and functional connectivity measures developed in Aim 1. Because of the novelty of the Connectome methods, we will assess the sensitivity of fiber tract identification and integrity compared to conventional methods across a 3-year follow-up interval in a subset of subjects.  The project addresses a growing need for early identification and differential diagnosis of individuals who will go on to develop different neurodegenerative diseases so that they can be targeted for participation in clinical trials or lifestyle interventions. Successful completion of the aims will contribute novel neuroimaging markers of prodromal neurodegenerative diseases and will further scientific knowledge of the relationship between functional network integrity and the integrity of fiber tracts connecting key nodes within a network."
"9478295","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary hypoplasia is a devastating complication of preterm delivery that is responsible for over 70% of the cases of perinatal mortality. Replacement of damaged cells with healthy cells that would participate in physiological processes and respond to local signaling cues is a therapeutic ideal that may be achievable using stem cell-based therapy. Embryonic stem (ES) cells show tremendous promise as a source of healthy cells. Indeed, we have shown that murine ES cells can be differentiated into specialized surfactant-producing alveolar type II pneumocytes that distribute in the lung parenchyma when implanted into preterm mice. However, the fundamental obstacle of immune rejection precludes long-term engraftment of these cells and impedes translation to clinical therapy. Clearly, new methods to alter the host's detection of the graft or induce graft tolerance are critical to advance of this potentially transformative therapeutic option. We have a longstanding interest in CD13, a multifunctional cell surface peptidase expressed on many cell types where it influences cell adhesion, migration, antigen presentation and endocytosis. Pertinent to this proposal, CD13 is also found on adult and embryonic stem cells. During the course of characterizing CD13KO mES cells, we observed that while cells of both genotypes grew equally well when subcutaneously injected as teratomas into immune-compromised mice, CD13KO ES showed markedly enhanced growth and differentiation in immune competent animals. These CD13KO teratomas contained fewer immune cells, suggesting that the absence of CD13 on the ES cells allowed the transplanted cells to evade immune detection. To confirm this notion, we performed skin transplants between gender-mismatched WT and CD13KO animals. Remarkably, the CD13KO grafts survived for greater than 100 days in both WT and CD13KO hosts while WT grafts were readily rejected, supporting our observations in the teratoma model. Furthermore, at 7d post-transplant the architecture of the skin in WT grafts was clearly disrupted with numerous graft-infiltrating immune cells, while the CD13KO grafts retained a more normal architecture with fewer infiltrating cells. While the hematopoietic profiles of nav CD13KO mice are normal, 18 there are fewer infiltrating T cell, macrophage populations and significantly reduced numbers of degranulated mast cells in gender-mismatched CD13KO grafts when compared to WT, consistent with WT grafts triggering a stronger immune response? Importantly, treatment of WT mice with a blocking anti-CD13 monoclonal antibody significantly enhanced the survival of mismatched WT grafts when compared to vehicle alone and treatment withdrawal led to graft rejection, implying that CD13 influences immune detection rather than tolerance induction. Taken together, our studies identify CD13 as a potential target for modulation of transplant immunity. We hypothesize that the absence of CD13 in donor cells allows them to escape immune detection and subsequent rejection, thus prolonging survival."
"9520609","1 Preterm birth (PTB) rates are substantially higher in the United States than in other industrialized nations,  2 and are disproportionately greater among-low income and minority women. These disparities have proven  3 difficult to ameliorate despite intensive efforts. However, recent studies indicate that a group-based model of  4 prenatal care (GPNC), CenteringPregnancy, significantly reduces PTB in low-income, minority women.  5 CenteringPregnancy is a multifaceted group intervention that integrates three aspects of prenatal care: health  6 assessment, education, and social support. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which GPNC  7 reduces PTB, since the biologic pathways leading to PTB are still incompletely understood. One well-  8 supported theory posits excessive inflammatory activity in maternal circulation and the maternal-fetal interface  9 as an etiology for PTB. Our group and others have linked adverse socioeconomic conditions and maternal 10 psychosocial functioning with circulating inflammatory biomarkers, chronic placental inflammation, and adverse 11 pregnancy outcomes. GPNC may reduce PTB by reducing systemic and placental inflammatory activity 12 through improved psychosocial functioning of women in socially disadvantaged conditions. In a pilot study, we 13 found evidence suggesting that GPNC ameliorates socioeconomic differences in placenta inflammatory lesions 14 and gene expression profiles.Though promising, replication of these results in a larger cohort is needed in 15 order to identify psychological, behavioral and biological mechanisms through which GPNC affects 16 inflammatory activity at the maternal-fetal interface,utilize placental gene expression to evaluate alternate 17 biologic pathways and to clarify the implications of these changes for reduction of PTB disparities. 18 Here, we propose to address these questions by leveraging an existing trial in Greenville, South Carolina 19 (1R01HD082311) that will enroll 3160 women from a predominantly low-income population. The parent study 20 employs a randomized controlled trial design to compare GPNC with traditional prenatal care, and is 21 adequately powered to detect differences in PTB by intervention and race. The parent study will collect and 22 analyze survey measures of behavioral and psychosocial outcomes, but it does not have the resources to 23 collect biomarkers or evaluate biologic mechanisms of action. The goal of this proposal is to add biospecimen 24 collection to the existing trial in order to understand whether GPNC, by improving psychosocial and behavioral 25 functioning, influences the inflammatory milieu during gestation. Specimens will be collected from 1150 women 26 and full analysis performed on a random subset of 900, with the aims of (1) quantifying differences in systemic 27 inflammatory biomarkers, placental histologic inflammation, and placental gene expression between women 28 participating in GPNC and those receivng routine prenatal care and (2) determining whether these differences 29 are mediated by improvements in psychosocial functioning and/or lifestyle characteristics. Ultimately, we aim to 30 understand the biological mechanisms through which GPNC reduces the frequency of PTB."
"9462088","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this randomized, controlled clinical trial is to investigate whether decreasing obesity through a weight loss intervention induces beneficial changes in the cholesterol gene network in monocytes and adipocytes that are associated with whole body glycemic changes. Recent studies suggest that interaction of monocyte-derived macrophages and adipocytes in adipose tissue plays a crucial role in adipose tissue inflammation, which may link obesity to insulin resistance. Disruption of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis in cells, such as monocytes/macrophages and adipocytes, is one of the cell-intrinsic factors shown to be responsible for insulin resistance in animal experimental studies. Our recent transcriptomic study of purified human monocytes extends these findings to humans, and specifically identifies a network of co-expressed cholesterol metabolism genes whose altered expression is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (p- trend: 5.07x10-10), as well as two important risk factors for T2DM - obesity (p: 1.6 x10-18) and inflammation (p: 2.0x10-7 for interleukin-6). Furthermore, weight loss appeared to reverse these alterations of the cholesterol metabolism genes in monocytes in our pilot study of 16 obese persons without a control group. We hypothesize that obesity and inflammation alters the cholesterol metabolism gene network in monocytes to increase intracellular cholesterol accumulation, and these changes along with related changes in adipocytes increase insulin resistance and disrupt glucose regulation, which subsequently lead to T2DM. To illustrate the role of this cholesterol gene network in weight loss-induced glycemic improvements, we will randomly assign 200 obese and prediabetic adults aged 40-60 years to diet-induced weight loss intervention (Diet, N=100) or healthy lifestyle education intervention (Control, N=100). We will achieve our goal through the following specific aims: 1) To test whether weight loss intervention rebalances methylomic/transcriptomic profiles in monocytes and adipocytes from obese persons; and 2) To determine whether weight loss-induced methylation and transcriptional changes in human monocytes and adipocytes correlate with whole body glycemic improvements. We will also explore whether the observed molecular changes in human monocytes alter glucose metabolism in human adipocytes, skeletal myocytes, and hepatocytes using in vitro models. The integration of epigenetic, transcriptional, and clinical data from the clinical trial and in viro experimental studies, carried out by a team of scientists with expertise in genetic epidemiology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, will provide novel insights concerning the regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism, and susceptibility to T2DM, potentially leading to new treatment and prevention targets."
"9507249","Abstract One of the central challenges in cancer genomics is the ability to accurately detect somatic mutations in heterogeneous tumors, and precisely determine which fraction of cancer cells harbor these mutations and at what frequency. Deeper understanding of the biological principals behind cancer evolution is central to the discovery of new cancer therapies. However, despite the tremendous advances in sequencing technologies over the last twenty years, most widely used computational approaches and biotechnologies still do not provide enough context to fully resolve the clonal structure in a tumor, due to a combination of low resolution, high cost, and prohibitive sample requirements. 10X Genomics has recently developed a new technology, called ?linked reads?, that address some of these limitations by providing long-range phasing information at low cost and with minimal sample requirements. However, for this data to achieve its full potential and benefit the whole cancer research community, new computational tools must be developed combining novel algorithms for next- generation sequencing data analysis with the long-range information stored in the linked-reads. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing a new variant caller that combines the long-range information in the linked-reads with powerful colored de Bruijn graph data structures to accurately discover and phase inherited and somatic variants (SNVs and indels) in tumor-normal paired sequencing data. The colored de Bruijn graph approach will exploit the full information in the data by jointly analyzing reads coming from the tumor and the normal samples together. This will reduce the false-discovery rate of alignment-based variant caller when detecting longer insertions and deletions, without sacrificing the additional variant calling power provided by the assembly method. Furthermore, the linked-reads data will allow phasing of the variants and improve determination of subclonal structure by directly observing which variants are present on the same molecule, and therefore within the same subclone. We will develop and carefully test our novel variant calling framework using a combination of synthetic and genuine datasets designed to assess the variant calling abilities under diverse sequencing conditions, tumor clonality, and sequencing platforms."
"9471722","PROJECT SUMMARY Emotion-regulatory deficits are a hallmark of mood and anxiety disorders. Thus, the ability to regulate emotional responses according to one's goals and to effectively override automatic responses to emotional events is paramount to mental health and wellbeing. Function of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) has been shown to play a pivotal role in supporting goal-oriented and flexible behavior. Moreover, extant data implicates LPFC dysfunction in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. However, studies establishing the specific and causal contributions of LPFC function to emotion regulation are sorely lacking. This proposal will illuminate the causal role of LPFC representations for goal-oriented behavioral regulation during affective processing and identify mediating neural mechanisms. The proposed studies will test the central hypothesis that task-relevant emotion-regulatory goals are dynamically represented in mid-LPFC, from which they are conveyed to topographically organized dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) and integrated with affect signals from the amygdala. This hypothesis is based on recent insights into PFC organization and documented neuroanatomical projections. The experiments will employ a behavioral task that is sensitive to LPFC function and that indexes the degree of influence of prepotent emotional stimuli on behavior depending on the task goal. The LPFC- dmPFC-amygdala circuitry will be examined using a combination of advanced neuroimaging multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and behavioral studies of patients with focal PFC lesions. This combination of novel data acquisition methods and analytic approaches will reveal the functional causal contributions of specific PFC regions and provide a precise mechanistic account of how the LPFC contributes to adaptive emotional responding. The proposed studies will thus fill a substantial gap in emotion regulation research, and further the development of a model that can be applied to optimize and personalize treatment for individuals who suffer from mood and anxiety disorders associated with PFC dysfunction."
"9490463","We propose a new clinical and translational sciences training program at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester (UMW) campus. Our current application is transdisciplinary ? a term describing investigators that work together to expand beyond discipline-based concepts, theories, and methods as a means to address a common research topic. Transdisciplinary teams work collaboratively to address a research topic, but through collaboration develop new questions originating from the cross-fertilization of disciplines. The proposed TL1 will engage pre- and early post-doctoral fellows in training across the entire translational spectrum to participate in a common clinical and translational science program. We have developed this novel training program because we recognize that to accelerate discovery and improve health, clinical and population scientists must understand and interact with the basic biomedical sciences. We will provide skills and experiences that position our trainees to uncover new knowledge that can be translated and implemented into the clinical arena for societal benefit; and inspire basic research based on human needs. Our collective institutional creativity and culture of collaboration support scientific inquiry across disciplinary boundaries, centers, and institutes. The specific aims include:  1. Train and nurture highly qualified pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees through the provision  of a novel, multifaceted, rigorous TL1 program in clinical and translational research.  2. Recruit trainees from national and local pools of eligible candidates, resulting in a diverse  trainee population with respect to clinical background and disciplinary perspective and with  diversity with respect to race/ethnicity, social disadvantages, and disabilities.  3. Provide trainees with the strong mentoring teams, rigorous academic training tailored to their  research interests, and technical skills necessary to ensure their success as independent  investigators and contributors to team science.  4. Provide ?hands on? research experience within transdisciplinary teams building on the  strengths of current linkages between UMW Departments, Centers, and Institutes. Post-doctoral trainees will complete the Master's in Clinical Investigation (T1 or T2+ concentration); pre- doctoral trainees will complete the clinical and translational science concentration. Our breadth of mentors, scientific disciplines, and academic programs offers the flexibility to individualize each trainee's experience while providing a strong methodological foundation."
"9475083","Project 1 Summary Cancer has been an important selective pressure in organismal evolution and a great deal of variation in cancer rates exist across species. Why do species vary in their susceptibility to cancer and what mechanisms are responsible? Life history theory (LHT) can provide a theoretical framework for why cancer rates vary. LHT is an evolutionary and ecological approach that focuses on organism-level tradeoffs between growth, maintenance and reproduction. Cancer suppression is one aspect of somatic maintenance, and our models have shown that LH factors can have dramatic effects on the optimal level of cancer suppression. In Aim 1, we propose to expand our LH models to include additional LH parameters to predict cancer mortality and somatic mutations rates across animals. We will validate this model with a highly curated dataset on cancer mortality rates from our collection of pathology reports. Additionally, we hypothesize that as organisms evolved larger bodies and longer lives, there was selection for increased cancer defenses. In Aim 2, we propose to test for the mechanisms of cancer defenses in mammals. Using a comparative genomics approach, we will test for signatures of selection, drift and mutation in tumor suppressor genes. In collaboration with Project 2, Aim 3, will experimentally validate the genomics findings in our comparative cell culture assays from primary fibroblasts. In Aim 3, we will connect the organismal evolution of cancer suppression (Aim 1) to cell level evolution (Projects 2 & 3) by creating computational model of the ecology and evolution of a neoplasm. Results from this model can predict the frequency of evo-eco tumor classifications. Our research team has made progress on these fundamental questions using a transdisciplinary approach that spans evolutionary biology, cancer biology, comparative genomics, quantitative modeling and animal health. Our work will comprise the largest quantitative study of cross-species cancer incidence, and shed light on cancer risk throughout nearly 100 million years of mammalian evolution. By identifying cancer resistant species, we have identified biological ?simulations? that contain many anti-cancer parameters. Using a comparative genomics approach, we can begin to identify which known parameters (i.e., DNA repair) are potentially more exploitable for human cancer prevention and treatment. Lastly, translating organismal evolution and ecology to tumor evolution and microenvironment can provide new insights into tumor classifications, which can lead clinicians towards a more personalized approach to treating tumors."
"9552695","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        The goal of this proposal is to test whether reactivating dormant or depressed orexin circuits can reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), improve neuroprotection and cognitive performance in mouse models of neurodegeneration. The long-term goal of this work is to identify a novel therapeutic strategy for improving cognition in neurodegenerative diseases such as narcolepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. These diseases have differing causes and etiology, but loss of a specific subset of hypothalamic cells, the orexin-containing neurons, occurs in all. Hypothalamic orexin neurons project to the hippocampus, a brain area important to learning and memory. Orexin action in the hippocampus improves cognitive performance and was recently shown to protect against neurodegeneration. Neuroprotective signals are reduced and ERS is activated during neurodegenerative disease, suggestive of a common underlying mechanism. Together, these data suggest reduced orexin signaling in neurodegenerative disease may reduce neuroprotection and increase ERS, causing further neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline.  A necessary step in determining whether therapeutic intervention can counter the effect of orexin loss in neurodegenerative disease is to test whether orexin-responsive pathways in the brain can be reactivated. The orexin/ataxin-3 mouse, first developed to study orexin loss in narcolepsy, is a transgenic model in which orexin neurons specifically and gradually decline during development, and cognitive processing deteriorates. Yet our preliminary data show that orexin receptor levels remain intact in young and old mice, and that stimulating these receptors with orexin restores cognition. These novel exciting data provide proof-of- concept that stimulation of orexin pathways, even when orexin neurons are lost, can be used as a strategy to improve cognition. We plan to determine the full potential of this strategy in the orexin ataxin (O/A3) mouse and in the alpha synucleinopathy mouse, a classic model of Parkinson disease. We will examine whether increasing hippocampal orexin tone rescues the cognitive deficit noted in these animals. We also have an established designer drug orexin activation model (DREADD), which is a transgenic mouse in which orexin neurons have been modified to be specifically activated by an otherwise metabolically inert drug. These mice will be crossed with the orexin ataxin and the Parkinson's disease (alpha synucleinopathy) mouse to determine whether stimulating remnant orexin neurons can also rescue dormant orexin-responsive pathways. To gain understanding of the underlying basis for observed cognitive changes resulting from manipulation of orexin pathways, we will measure markers of neuroprotection and ERS in hippocampus.  Our overall hypothesis is that orexin promotes neuroprotection and reduces ERS, and that reactivating orexin-responsive pathways will ameliorate neurodegeneration-related cognitive disturbances. To test this, we will determine whether orexin replacement therapy and orexin neuron stimulation improves cognitive performance, markers of neuroprotection and ERS in 1) mice with mild, moderate, and severe orexin neuron loss; and 2) in a classic model of PD. We predict that enhancing orexin tone will improve cognitive performance by improving neuroprotection and decreasing ERS. The results of these studies will determine if orexin rescue is an important strategy in countering cognitive decline, and could ultimately provide a therapeutic pathway to target in neurodegenerative disease."
"9525083","The National Research Action Plan (NRAP) (2013) called attention to the alarmingly high rates of combat-related PTSD observed among service members and veterans deployed in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a result, the Consortium to Alleviate PTSD (CAP) was formed to a) significantly advance treatment strategies for PTSD including interventions for early, chronic, and latent onset cases, and b) to identify and confirm clinically relevant biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of PTSD and co-occurring disorders. This project aims to fill gaps identified in the NRAP by examining the validity of genetic-based biomarkers to identify PTSD, PTSD course, and response to PTSD treatment. We plan to leverage extensive existing resources in the STRONG STAR Repository to examine a comprehensive set of genetic and epigenetic markers associated with PTSD. These resources include: (1) a collection of human postmortem tissue of PTSD (n=30) and matched control (n=60) brains; (2) a cohort of service members treated for PTSD with blood collected prior to treatment and at 6 months post-treatment (n=600); and (3) an epidemiologic cohort of Soldiers assessed prior to and after deployment in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn that included blood collection and PTSD assessment at each assessment (n=4,112). Using a combination of whole-genome microarray and sequencing approaches, we will: (1) identify genetic (SNP, mRNA) or epigenetic (DNA methylation, microRNA) alterations in PTSD; (2) characterize the neuronal morphology of selected brain regions in PTSD and matched controls through Golgi impregnation; (3) identify top gene regulatory networks among the identified set of genes across the samples to guide biomarker analyses; and (4) systematically identify, validate, and test biomarkers based on the mRNA, SNPs, DNA methylation, and microRNA markers of identified genes. We have assembled a collaborative team of scientists consisting of a genetic epidemiologist (Dr. Williamson), a psychiatric geneticist (Dr. Gelernter), a geneticist (Dr. Carless), a neuroanatomist (Dr. Selemon), human postmortem experts (Drs. Young, Kleinman, Hyde, Thompson, & Cruz), biostatisticians (Drs. Mintz, Gelfond, Michelek, & Jaffe), and a clinical psychologist (Dr. Litz). In addition, we propose to collaborate with the DoD Integrated Systems Biology group (Drs. Jett & Hammamieh) to leverage SysBioCube in order to gain a systems level perspective of our ?-omics? data that will in turn guide our biomarker discovery work. It is expected that this project will be an important first step in filling the genomic and biomarker gaps in PTSD identified by the NRAP and facilitate the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarker panels to aid in the detection, treatment, and prevention of PTSD."
"9495526","Project Summary Pancreatic cancer remains the most lethal disease with no effective therapeutics. We have recently made conceptual advances in targeting signature genomic deletions, a hallmark of human cancers. We demonstrated earlier that passenger deletions could confer cancer cell specific vulnerabilities, which we termed ?Collateral Lethality?. We deployed this concept in targeting the SMAD4 deletion, which occurs frequently in pancreatic cancer, and have identified malic enzyme (ME) 3 as a target for collateral lethality in SMAD4-deleted pancreatic tumor cells harboring adjacent deletion of malic enzyme 2. We unexpectedly discovered that mitochondrial malic enzymes are required for the uptake of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) in pancreatic cancer, which has been implicated as a diagnostic plasma marker for early detection of pancreatic cancer. Our overall goals are: to validate ME3 as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer in vitro and in PDX models (Aim 1) and in vivo using chimeric PDAC model (Aim 2); and to identify useful therapeutic agents that specifically target ME2 deleted cells (Aim 3). Our goals align well with the NCI directive on ?Scientific Framework for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.?"
"9468252","PROJECT SUMMARY The mammalian visual system utilizes a powerful set of algorithms to extract crucial information from the environment that informs an individual's decisions. These algorithms require constant adjustment to match the individual's current needs ? a task achieved partly by neuromodulators such as serotonin. In some cases, these modulatory systems open the door for maladaptive changes to visual processing. For example, visual hallucination is a debilitating yet common neurological symptom arising in many distinct disorders, including schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Serotonin receptors are key mediators of these symptoms, and their blockade by antipsychotics disrupts hallucinations. However, these drugs cause numerous unwanted side effects, and the lack of therapies with greater specificity reflects the gaps in our understanding of exactly how serotonergic signaling modulates visual processing. Our fundamental goal is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying serotonergic modulation of visual processing to better inform models of visual function and therapeutic targeting of visual hallucinations. In this proposal, we use genetic tools in mouse visual cortex to determine how visual cortical computations are affected by serotonergic modulation. In our first aim, we will measure the effects of serotonin 5HT2A receptor activation on spontaneous and visually evoked activity, followed by identification and manipulation of specific cortical cell types. In our second aim, we will determine how contextual information from outside the classic receptive field is integrated, based on the computation of normalization, and modulated by these receptors. Together these experiments will reveal the role of serotonergic signaling in processing of both local and global information, which should in turn provide insight into disorders of altered perception such as schizophrenia."
"9412509","PROJECT SUMMARY Pan-Genomic Approaches for Comprehensive Screening of Novel or Emerging Infectious Agents in Blood  Emerging infectious agents, the latest of which is Zika virus, continually threaten the safety of the 15 million transfusions performed annually in the United States, yet the lack of diagnostic tools to comprehensively test for all bloodborne pathogens or to identify infections from novel viruses has greatly hindered surveillance efforts. In a previous grant, we have pioneered the development of microarray and metagenomic sequencing-based approaches to comprehensively screen blood for both known and novel pathogens, and have identified a number of novel viruses circulating in human blood. We have established long-term collaborations with national and international collaborators who will provide us with clinical and donor blood samples from individuals infected with chikungunya, dengue, Ebola, Zika, Lassa, and West Nile virus, as well as non-viral pathogens (e.g. Babesia microti and Plasmodium falciparum), for analysis. This project proposes (1) to develop an accurate and comprehensive yet practical sequencing-based platform (BloodSeq) for simultaneous detection and whole-genome characterization of all American Association of Blood Banks (AABB)-priority pathogens in infected patients and blood donations, (2) to discover and further describe the epidemiology and potential pathogenicity of novel infectious viruses that pose a potential threat of bloodborne transmission, and (3) to define complementary host response biosignatures for transfusion-transmissible pathogens using transcriptome profiling, especially in asymptomatic infected donors. A key deliverable from this 5-year project will be implementation of the BloodSeq platform by public health agencies such as the American Red Cross for comprehensive bloodborne pathogen screening of the blood supply.The results from these studies will advance genomic sequencing technologies as validated screening tools to ensure transfusion safety, with significant clinical and public health implications."
"9442717","PROJECT SUMMARY ACL injuries affect over 400,000 patients each year. Our current best treatment is ACL reconstruction, where the torn ACL is removed and replaced with a graft of tendon harvested from another part of the knee. ACL reconstruction has a high rate of success in terms of returning patients to sport and activities of daily living. However, patients not only have to wait until the graft heals in, they also have to heal the area where the graft was harvested. Even with intense physical therapy, patients often still have as high as a 30% deficit in hamstring strength 6 months after a hamstring tendon graft is used. In addition, high rates of premature osteoarthritis - as high as 76% within 14 years of injury, are seen after ACL reconstruction, as well as high failure rates in adolescents. For this reason, new methods of treating ACL injuries are of interest. One such method is Bridge-Enhanced ACL Repair (BEAR), where a suture repair of the ACL is supplemented with a bioactive scaffold. In preclinical trials, this technique has shown equivalent results to ACL reconstruction in terms of mechanical stability of the joint and knees treated with bridge-enhanced repair had significantly less osteoarthritis than those treated with ACL reconstruction. With these promising preclinical results, we have obtained FDA approval and are currently conducting a 20-patient first-in-human study of the BEAR technique. With the promising results of that study, we now propose to conduct a 100-patient multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing the BEAR technique with ACL reconstruction. The work proposed in this U34 clinical trial planning grant application will allow us to select the appropriate number of sites to ensure timely enrollment, complete all protocols and regulatory materials, compete the self-report assessment tools, optimize the data management plan, enhance provider equipoise regarding enrollment and intervention delivery and complete surgical training for surgeons at all sites. The initial sites to be in the trial include Boston Children's Hospital, Ohio State University, Washington University St Louis and the Cleveland Clinic. Boston Children's Hospital is where the bridge-enhanced ACL repair technique has been developed and where the first-in-human trial is being conducted. Ohio State University, Washington University, and the Cleveland Clinic are all sites with a strong record of recruiting patients for ACL studies, including the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) studies. Through the collaborative effort of these sites, we will be able to design and prepare the documentation for a successful multi-site trial of a promising new treatment of bridge-enhanced ACL repair with our current gold standard of treatment, ACL reconstruction."
"9520638","Current treatments for depression have limitations that significantly impact treatment outcomes. One is that a large percentage (~40%) of patients are resistant to any current treatment. Evidence now indicates that the endogenous opioid system may represent a previously under-appreciated system that can yield novel anti-depressant treatments. We will extend recent preliminary data to test this possibility directly.  We will first test the hypothesis that deletion of proenkephalin-derived peptides alters the behavioral and molecular responses to chronic fluoxetine. We have recently demonstrated that the known antidepressant tianeptine is an agonist of the mu opioid receptor (MOR). We and others have also found that expression of the proenkephalin (Penk) gene, which encodes a precursor to an endogenous MOR ligand, is dramatically up regulated in the dentate gyrus following chronic treatment with several SSRIs. These findings suggest that Penk peptides may be central components in the molecular response to anti-depressant treatment. We will test this possibility by determining whether chronic behavioral anti-depressant activities of fluoxetine are altered or abolished in Penk KO mice. We will further determine the extent to which previously-determined gene expression changes in response to chronic fluoxetine are altered in Penk KO mice and thus begin to position Penk up-regulation in this molecular cascade.  Our second aim will test the hypothesis that pharmacologic up-regulation of enkephalin peptides in specific brain regions is sufficient to promote behavioral responses to SSRIs. Systemic injection of enkephalinase inhibitors can produce anti-depressive and analgesic actions resulting from enkephalin peptide up-regulation, though the cellular sites of activity have remained undefined. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RB-101 rapidly increases analgesic activity following icv injection. We will extend these studies to examine acute anti-depressant effects of RB-101 injection directly into several brain regions in both WT and Penk deficient mice. This pharmacologic approach will thus mimic one specific molecular response to chronic SSRI treatment and thus begin to determine whether increased Penk alone is sufficient to mediate anti-depressant responses as well as identify the specific brain regions that can mediate such effects.  Finally, we will identify the opioid receptor specificity of increased enkephalin action. Enkephalin can bind the delta opioid receptor (DOR) as well as MOR and these opioid system components are co- expressed in the hippocampus, a major locus implicated in anti-depressant action. We will compare anti- depressive actions of RB-101 in MOR, DOR and MOR/DOR KO mice following injection into multiple brain regions to determine whether responses are altered in the absence of either or both receptors. These studies will thus identify the receptor(s) mediating enkephalin activities and begin to develop a more detailed understanding of the circuitry underlying opioid system activity in anti-depressive action."
"9483613","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT New evidence from our studies demonstrates that specific P. acnes ribotypes, distinguished by unique 16S rDNA, may be associated with either healthy skin (ribotype PH) or acne (ribotype PA). We propose to investigate the nature of immune mechanisms by which ribotypes PH and PA induce Th1 vs. Th17-mediated responses. The P. acnes ribotypes PH and PA to be used in this study are the most prevalent and include three each of PH and PA strains that have been enriched in individuals with healthy skin or associated with the acne patient group. We will test our central hypothesis that that P. acnes ribotypes trigger T cells that mediate distinct immune responses, which either contribute to the pathogenesis of acne or lead to a protective mechanism. In Aim 1, we will use informatics, taking advantage of the publicly available skin database DermDB to gain insight into the mechanisms of T cell differentiation. Specifically, using RNAsequencing, we will derive gene signatures of PH and PA-activated innate immune cells, to identify the networks that determine T cell differentiation into functional Th1 and Th17 cell subsets. We will also determine the mechanism(s), including cytokine, by which PH and PA induce T cell differentiation. Although the P. acnes genome has been sequenced, virulence factors and specific ligand(s) that activate immune cells are not clear. We have previously demonstrated that the Toll like receptor-2 (TLR2) mediates the interaction between antigen presenting cells and P. acnes. The bacterial ligand(s) responsible for these interactions are potential therapeutic targets, but are currently unknown. In Aim 2, we propose to use biochemical and proteomic techniques to identify bacterial ligand(s) from PH and PA that lead to differential immune signatures identified in Aim 1, and using siRNA knockdown of specific pathogen recognition receptors (PRR), identify the PRRs that recognize PH and PA to induce the innate cytokines that instruct adaptive immunity. The data generated in Aim 2 will help in the identification of PH and PA ligand(s) that interact with innate PRRs, and provide new insights into the immunobiology of Th1 and Th17 cells. In Aim 3, we will identify the phenotype and function of Th1 vs. Th17 cells induced by P. acnes ribotypes PH and PA. Using the informatics approaches outlined in Aim 1 we have identified IL-26 within the potential new Th17 gene networks. A previously unknown function of Th17- derived IL-26 as a direct antimicrobial agent and activator of DNA-sensing innate immunity was recently reported. Here, we will determine the antimicrobial mechanisms of encoded proteins against P. acnes including IL-26 in in vitro CFU assays, and determine the frequency of IL-26 expressing cells in acne skin specimens by immunohistology. Our investigations of the mechanisms by which distinct ribotypes of a commensal bacterium trigger divergent immune responses will have broad applicability to understanding microbiome-host immune response interactions as well as identify novel targets for immunological intervention. Overall, the K01 training program will allow me to develop the skills and tools needed to become a successful independent investigator."
"9552692","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        The Gap in Knowledge/ Work Accomplished: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly common among patients with asthma and exacerbates the airways disease, but mechanisms are unknown. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a hallmark feature of OSA, may be one important contributor. In our recently published and preliminary work, CIH exposure during allergen-induced airway inflammation in rats: 1) caused airflow limitation; 2) increased peribronchial collagen deposition in the proximal airways and led to matrix degradation of distal airways and parenchyma; 3) amplified the allergen-induced increase in airway monocytes, which may be non- classically activated and polarize into more pro-fibrotic M2 macrophage phenotype; 4) synergistically with the allergen, increased expression and activity of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor - 1 (PAI-1) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Interestingly, none of these features would be responsive to inhaled corticosteroids. These novel findings underscore the potential of comorbid OSA to worsen asthma and cause irreversible detriments to lung function. However, these findings raise questions regarding: i) contributions of central airway resistance, small airway collapse and decreased elastance of lung parenchyma to CIH-induced airflow obstruction and reversibility of these physiologic deficits; ii) phenotype, activation state and roe of the monocytes and macrophages in our model; and iii) the role of PAI-1 in CIH-induced lung remodeling and airflow obstruction. Lack of understanding of these processes and their molecular underpinnings prevents development of more effective therapies for the large fraction of asthma patients suffering from the interaction with OSA. Hypothesis/ Aims: The long term goal is to develop effective strategies for treating asthma by targeting its interaction with OSA. The objective of this proposal is to test the physiological, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying CIH-induced airflow obstruction and lung remodeling during House Dust Mites (HDM)-induced inflammation in rats. Our data led us to the central hypothesis that CIH-induced airflow obstruction during allergen challenge arises from increased resistance in proximal and distal airways along with reduced parenchymal tissue elastance, which result from increased monocyte-derived M2 macrophages with increased activity of PAI-1. To address this hypothesis, we propose to test the following Aims: 1) the physiologic mechanisms of CIH-induced lower airway obstruction during HDM airway inflammation; 2) the effect of CIH on lung monocyte activation and macrophage polarization; 3) the role of PAI-1 in CIH-induced airflow obstruction. Design: Four groups (n=10/group) of Brown-Norway rats will be sensitized with HDM or saline (SAL) and placed under CIH vs. normoxia (NORM) for 6 weeks, with weekly HDM or SAL challenges. Two days after last challenge, for Aim 1, central and distal airway, and lung elastic properties (elastance & compliance) will be measured pre & post bronchodilator. On histology, we will quantify the bronchial collagen and smooth muscle. For Aim 2, monocyte and macrophage (M1 vs. M2) will be quantified by flow cytometry, quantitative (q)PCR, and immunohistochemistry in BAL and/or lung. A separate study will test physiologic and histologic effects of marrow derived - macrophage depletion with clodronate. For Aim 3, total and active PAI-1 will be measured in BAL and lung homogenate by ELISA. An additional experiment will measure physiologic & histologic effects of PAI-1 inhibition in HDM-challenged rats exposed to CIH vs. NORM and fed regular chow or tiplaxtinin. Project Significance and Innovation: Our project is innovative, as it is the first in-depth investigation of the mechanisms whereby a commonly encountered clinical exposure, CIH, induces airway obstruction and remodeling. The study will lead to targeted therapies for Veterans afflicted with comorbid OSA and asthma. Results will be relevant to other lung diseases of high importance to Veterans, such as emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, which also feature an interaction with OSA that relates with increased mortality."
"9459988","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This R01 proposal seeks to test a computer technology (C-CHESS) that offers a common approach to multiple chronic conditions (MCCs). Among Medicare beneficiaries, 65% have 3 or more MCCs and 23% have 5 or more. People with MCCs account for 90% of Medicare spending. MCCs are usually addressed in primary care. Increasing workloads in primary care often prevent clinicians from addressing self-management skills with patients, though such skills as goal-setting and tracking are important for managing chronic conditions. Behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, self-monitoring, and social support can improve both self-management skills and health outcomes, and technology can effectively deliver such interventions.  C-CHESS (Chronic Condition Health Enhancement Support System) provides tools, motivation, and social support to help patients with MCCs better manage their conditions, including interactions that arise among the combination of conditions. C-CHESS is built on elements of success behavioral interventions: long duration, ongoing outreach, monitoring, prompts, action planning, problem solving, self-tailoring, and peer support. C-CHESS addresses clinician burden by promptly communicating important changes in patient status and?by improving patient-self-management?reducing primary care visits. C-CHESS will be tested in a randomized clinical trial in 5 primary care clinics in southern Wisconsin. The trial will involve 330 patients age 65 and older with 3 or all 4 of these conditions: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and osteoarthritis. Patients will be assigned to treatment as usual + C-CHESS or treatment as usual + access to the Internet. The trial will last 12 months with a 6-month follow up. The goal of the trial is to detect differences between the 2 groups in quality of life and use of primary care. Secondarily, the trial aims to detect differences between the 2 groups in (1) measures for each condition (blood pressure, LDL, blood sugar, and pain); (2) a composite score that combines the individual measures; and (3) number of symptoms patients have from a list of 8. The trial will also examine factors that may mediate the relationship between the interventions and outcomes: adherence to medications and appointment attendance, as well as the 3 components of self-determination theory (patient competence, relatedness to others, and motivation). Finally, the trial will examine factors that may affect the strength of the relationship between C-CHESS and outcomes: gender, age, and number of chronic conditions.  If successful, C-CHESS will improve the health and reduce the burden on primary care of a large, growing, expensive group of patients whose conditions are not now well addressed. Successful implementation may point to a shift from care that is place-based, focused on medical management, and periodic to care focused on helping patients manage their own conditions through a system built on the proven principles of effective behavioral interventions made easy for both patients and clinicians to use."

"9251666","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Dynamics of Family Well-Being in Indonesia, will put into the public domain a fifth wave of data on children and young adults in Indonesia from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), covering a 20 year period since 1993. This will represent one of the longest running socio-economic panel data sets on children and young adults in a developing country. Adding a fifth wave to IFLS will greatly add the capacity of researchers to study children and young adults and their transitions into adulthood and even across generations. In the twenty years between IFLS1 and IFLS5, children aged 10 in IFLS1 will be 30. They will have completed their transition to young adulthood and even have young children of their own. For the 20 year period, prospective data will be available on individual factors such as health, including biomarkers; health care utilization; schooling outcomes and histories; work histories; migration and marriage histories. In addition, because IFLS covers entire households, information will be available on household-level factors such as consumption, income and assets, and household formation and dissolution; which are critical to understand individual outcomes.  The recent past has seen a strong economic recovery after a dramatic economic collapse in 1998, with GDP declining by 13%. This history means that we will see children being born in a period of great disruption followed by slow and then more rapid growth, over a fifteen year period after the crisis. This provides researchers a rare look at the long-run aftermath of a major economic crisis on many outcomes across the life cycle.  We will continue a number of field-related methodological innovations implemented in previous waves that dramatically raised the quality of the surveys. Fundamental to these are methods of tracking households to ensure high household and individual follow-up rates."
"9566395","Project Summary / Abstract Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common genetic cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema and affects between 70,000-100,000 individuals in the United States. Individuals with AATD have extremely low plasma and lung levels of AAT, a serine protease inhibitor that inactivates neutrophil elastase (NE) and other proteases to maintain protease-antiprotease balance in the lung. In the absence of AAT, NE activity is unchecked leading to accelerated elastin degradation, progressive damage to the extracellular matrix, and causing early-onset emphysema. Desmosine and isodesmosine (DES), markers of NE-mediated elastolysis, can be measured in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, correlate with lung function, and can be modified by AAT augmentation therapy which currently forms the mainstay of AATD treatment. While AAT augmentation therapy may slow emphysema progression, data is not definitive and the therapy is costly and burdensome. Direct inhibition of NE, the mediator of lung injury, represents a more direct approach. AZD9668 is a potent, selective, and orally available NE inhibitor that was developed as treatment for pulmonary diseases characterized by increased protease activity. In Phase 2 clinical trials, AZD9668 improved lung function in bronchiectasis, reduced markers of elastin degradation in cystic fibrosis, and improved inflammatory markers in a subset of non-AATD COPD patients without raising any safety concerns. We hypothesize that AZD9668 will block NE activity in the lungs and plasma of AATD patients and thus reduce DES levels in both compartments and that the drug will be safe and well tolerated. We will test this through the following specific aims: UG3 Phase: 1. To finalize the study protocol and manual of procedures, establish the coordinating center and the electronic database system, execute clinical site contracts, gain IRB approvals for the phase II study, and apply for and receive approval of an investigator initiated IND for AZD9668 in AATD from the FDA. UH3 Phase: 2a. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of AZD9668 120mg bid in a 12-week randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a trial in patients with AATD and COPD. The co-primary endpoints will be the reduction in elastin degradation and NE activity as measured by DES in plasma and the safety and tolerability of AZD9668. Secondary endpoints include lung function, health status, and dyspnea as well as additional measurements of NE activity, elastolysis, and inflammation in blood and BAL. 2b. To determine the utility of baseline plasma and BAL DES as a biomarker of AZD9668 response in patients with AATD. This project explores a novel therapeutic approach to target the excessive proteolysis/elastolysis in AATD and if successful will set the stage to further develop this paradigm shifting oral therapeutic strategy."
"9532176","Project Summary/Abstract Understanding how circuits in visual cortex transform the information supplied by different populations of retinal ganglion cells into orderly representations of the visual world remains a fundamental challenge that limits our progress in elucidating the cortical mechanisms of visual perception. While progress has been substantial, a major gap in our understanding of the cortical transform remains because the transform ultimately resides in the input/output functions of individual neurons, and the functional synaptic architecture that allows individual neurons to integrate inputs from diverse sources to produce coherent sensory representations remains largely unknown. The experiments in this proposal address this challenge by employing state of the art in vivo functional imaging techniques to probe the functional synaptic architecture of columnar representations in layer 2/3 of primary visual cortex (V1). Recent work from this laboratory has provided new insights into how the information derived from ON- and OFF- center retinal ganglion cells is transformed into orderly columnar maps of orientation, visual space, and absolute spatial phase in layer 2/3 of the tree shrew, a species that has a close phylogenetic relation to primates and a well-developed functional columnar architecture. The goal of the proposed experiments is to elucidate the functional synaptic architecture of this cortical transform by using in vivo 2-photon imaging of calcium signals to visualize the response properties of identified synaptic inputs within the dendritic fields of individual layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Two specific aims are proposed, one focused on elucidating the synaptic architecture of the receptive field center and the other, the synaptic architecture of the receptive field surround. These experiments will provide the first detailed test of the functional specificity of synaptic inputs that a neuron receives and how these inputs compare with the properties of the receptive field center and surround. Equally important, these experiments will determine the spatial organization of functionally defined synaptic inputs within the dendritic tree, providing the first direct test of the hypothesis that dendritic topology contributes significantly to somatic receptive field structure. By taking advantage of a novel model system, and the latest advances in in vivo imaging and genetically encoded calcium sensors, these experiments will yield a host of novel insights into the functional synaptic architecture of the cortical transform that will enlighten our understanding of mechanisms of cortical function and their alteration in injury and disease."
"9462147","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that induces visual impairment, and is a leading cause of blindness. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 45% of patients diagnosed with diabetes develop diabetic retinopathy. Altered retinal blood flow is an early consequence of the disease, and may contribute to vascular damage that occurs as the disease progresses. Thus, understanding the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction is essential to preventing later stages of diabetic retinopathy. From its onset, diabetic retinopathy is characterized by an inability of the retinal blood supply to match neuronal demand for uninterrupted delivery of oxygen and nutrients. In the retina, most of these interactions take place at the level of capillaries, where pericytes, the only contractile cells at this level, adjust capillary diameter in response to neuronal signals. Th neurotransmitter acetylcholine, released by cholinergic neurons, induces pericyte-mediated vasodilation. Both pericytes and cholinergic neurons are structurally compromised in diabetic retinopathy. It is unclear, however, whether this translates into impaired vasomotor function. To address this, in Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that decline in vasomotor ability of pericytes and changes in their gap junction coupling mediate impaired vasomotor control in diabetic retina. We will (1a) measure pericyte activity in response to electrical and chemical stimulation, then (1b) determine whether decreased gap junction coupling reduces pericyte activity propagation. This is relevant, since individual pericytes control local capillary diameter, while signaling between pericytes via gap junctions allows for the spatial distribution of vasomotor control. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that reduced vascular sensitivity to cholinergic signaling and a decline in cholinergic amacrine cell function both impair vasomotor activity. First we will (2a) use cholinergic agonists and antagonists to determine whether the efficacy of cholinergic regulation of capillary diameter is compromised in diabetic retina. Then, (2b) we will use an optogenetic approach to directly activate cholinergic amacrine cells, to determine whether they are functionally compromised. Altered retinal blood flow is a common characteristic of patients with early stages of diabetic retinopathy, and likely contributes to latr complications of the disease. Functional compromises to the cells responsible for regulating blood flow in the retina may account for this vasomotor deficit. Understanding the mechanisms of vasomotor dysfunction could reveal novel therapeutic targets, and provide additional approaches for treating diabetic retinopathy."
"9447211","Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Novel therapeutic strategies that target multiple mediators in SCD-PH have the potential to reduce this devastating complication of SCD. Recent findings indicate that activation of the nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?), attenuates PH and several mediators of hypoxia-induced PH, including NOX4 and ET-1, and favorably modulates microRNAs (miRNAs or miR) by reducing miR-27a (which reduces PPAR?) and increasing miR-98 (which reduces ET-1). miRNAs are differentially expressed during development and disease, but pharmacological targeting of miRNAs has not been defined in SCD-PH. Based on our preliminary and published studies, we will explore the hypothesis that heme released during intravascular hypoxia/hemolysis in SCD induces miRNAs in the vascular wall that reduce PPAR? levels and increase NF-?B levels thereby contributing to endothelial dysfunction and PH pathogenesis. New preliminary data support the feasibility of using chronic hypoxia to induce more severe PH, right ventricle hypertrophy (RVH), and pulmonary vascular remodeling in SCD to test novel therapeutic approaches. Aim 1 will examine regulation of pathogenic miRNAs in SCD-PH. Preliminary data indicate that hemin activates v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS1) to increase miR-27a thereby reducing PPAR? and enabling miR-98 upregulation in the lung in SCD-PH and in hemin-treated human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs). The role of altered endothelial PPAR? in SCD-PH will be further examined using novel chimeric mouse models generated by transplanting SCD bone marrow into mice with endothelial-targeted PPAR? gain (SSePPAR?OX) or loss (SSePPAR?KO) of function. These models will permit direct analysis of the ETS1/miR-27a/PPAR?/miR-98 signaling axis in SCD-PH. Aim 2 is based on evidence that PPAR? increases levels of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, HUWE1 (which also constitutes the host gene of miR-98) to induce ubiquitination of NF-?B and termination of NF-?B activation in SCD-PH. Aim 2 will explore the role of reduced PPAR? in NF-?B activation and endothelial dysfunction in SCD-PH. Aim 2 will determine the impact of PPAR? on HUWE1 and NF-?B using PPAR? gain or loss of function approaches or using PPAR? activation with pharmacological ligands. PPAR? regulation of HUWE1 will be confirmed with in vitro studies using luciferase reporter and ChIP assays. Pull-down and ubiquitination assays will determine if HUWE1 acts as an E3 ligase for promoting NF-?B ubiquitination in vitro, and endothelial-targeted HUWE1 KO mice will be used for in vivo studies. The overall goal of this proposal is to define novel molecular pathways involved in SCD-PH pathogenesis that can be therapeutically targeted. The results of these pre-clinical studies can inform future clinical trials examining PPAR? ligands as a novel therapeutic approach in SCD-PH."
"9471312","Aging is associated with a loss of muscle mass in the form of sarcopenia and a loss of bone mass and density in the form of osteoporosis. Loss of muscle and bone mass with age are in turn underlying factors contributing to falls and fractures in the elderly, and these fractures are very costly both in terms of financial burden and quality of life. A critical barrier to progress in correcting the problem of muscle and bone loss with aging is a poor understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying age-related musculoskeletal dysfunction. Our goal is to address this problem by providing critical, new information on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control these processes, and thereby improve scientific knowledge, technical capability, and eventually clinical practice. Our central hypothesis is that extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, secreted by stem cells in bone marrow are significantly altered with aging, and that altered EVs contribute to muscle and bone loss by transporting specific microRNAs (miRNAs). This hypothesis is based on our preliminary data indicating that the miRNAs carried by EVs in bone marrow are significantly altered with age. Moreover, treatment of young bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with EVs from bone marrow of aged animals suppresses the osteogenic differentiation of these cells, and treatment of young myoblasts with these EVs suppresses the expression of myogenic genes. Our preliminary results also suggest that these age-related changes in EV-derived miRNAs can be reversed with long-term caloric restriction. Our objectives are to 1) define how aging alters the secretion and cargo of EVs from bone-derived stem cells, and 2) determine how these EVs regulate key cellular events in bone loss and muscle atrophy.Our expected outcomes include 1) identification of EV-derived miRNAs that are actively secreted by bone marrow stem cells and are altered with age, and 2) determination of how these small molecules affect key cellular processes directly related to bone and muscle loss with aging. The impact of this project will be new findings on the role of EVs and miRNAs in the development of age-related diseases and end-organ injuries. In the future this knowledge may be critical in the diagnosis, treatment and management of vulnerable patient populations debilitated by the vast array of age-induced pathologies. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that bone- derived EVs, and their miRNAs, are induced by specific age-related stimuli.Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that EVs, and their miRNAs, altered with aging directly impact key cellular events in muscle atrophy and bone formation in vitro. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that EVs, and their miRNAs, altered with aging directly impact key cellular events in muscle atrophy and bone formation in vivo."
"9543281","ABSTRACT: UC DAVIS SUPERFUND RESEARCH PROGRAM Superfund sites are diverse, and many include unknown chemicals, chemicals of unknown toxicity and/or toxic degradation products. Currently, methods to detect, prioritize, and remediate these chemicals are incomplete or nonexistent. The UC Davis Superfund Research Center (UCD-SRC) will conduct research to: (i) improve understanding of the mechanisms by which hazardous chemicals produce adverse health effects, (ii) develop, validate and integrate novel methods to evaluate chemical exposures, levels of contamination, and health risks, and (iii) develop innovative remediation strategies to reduce hazardous substance exposure and toxicity. To achieve these goals the SRC consists of 5 integrated projects, 2 research support cores, a training core, a community engagement core, a research translation core and an administrative core. The UCD-SRC will use integrated chromatographic, biosensor and cell based technologies to detect and identify contaminants and develop innovative approaches for bioremediation. Rapid immunochemical and cell based analysis will supplement classical technologies for the evaluation of sites, as well as determining human susceptibility, exposure and effect. Fundamental mechanisms of toxic action of selected chemicals will be explored to predict risk and develop new biomarkers. This mechanistic knowledge will be extended in vivo with an emphasis on mechanism of toxicity. We are expanding the use of transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and integrated bioinformatics technologies to discover new mechanisms of action of hazardous materials and biomarkers for their action and to connect hazardous substance exposures to organism level effects. The biomarkers developed in this project will serve as biological dosimeters in exposure studies. All aspects of the program will be connected to our Community Engagement Core, and subject to community approval will be demonstrated on Yurok Tribal Lands. Technologies developed by the SRC will be tested at field sites and transferred to end users through a research translation core. Program Relevance We will develop sensitive systems for evaluating and mitigating the risk of hazardous chemicals on human populations and the environment using biomarkers of both exposure and effect."
"9458103","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans spend at least $100 billion each year on low back pain, a ubiquitous job-related disability and a leading contributor to missed days of work. While the etiology of disc disease is multifactorial, there is general agreement that loss of water and a decrease in osmotic pressure compromises cellular function and exacerbates the disease state. We have recently shown that T1? MRI and Opening Pressure (OP), parameters of disc hydration and osmotic status, provide quantitative measures of both tissue degeneration and back pain. Despite recognition of these facts, molecular mechanisms that control the disc water content and osmotic pressure remain poorly understood. We have shown that TonEBP, the only known osmoresponsive transcription factor is expressed in the nucleus pulposus (NP) and is diminished in the disease state. Based on these findings, we propose to test an innovative overarching hypothesis: TonEBP activity is linked to osmotic status of the NP and correlates with T1? and OP and controls critical NP survival and functional activities; compromised TonEBP function promotes development of disease. To test this central hypothesis, first, we will measure the expression of TonEBP and its target genes in human degenerate discs in relationship to measures of hydration status and pain: T1? and OP. We will then define the importance of TonEBP by suppressing its expression and evaluating its effects on NP cell apoptosis, autophagy and senescence. Second, we will determine the mechanism by which TonEBP controls expression of water transporters (aquaporins) and proteoglycans, molecules required for the maintenance of the osmotic properties of the disc. In addition, we will measure expression of key enzymes required for glycan synthesis and sulfation. We will determine if the disease process has altered the ability of TonEBP to respond to osmotic shifts. We will ascertain if restoration of TonEBP activity in diseased human cells using angiotensin II (ANG II), PDGF-BB or TonEBP expression plasmid stimulates matrix synthesis and aquaporin levels. The third goal of the investigation is to determine if inactivation of TonEBP compromises osmotic and biomechanical properties of the disc in vivo. Using lentiviral-ShTonEBP injection in rat discs and conditional inactivation of TonEBP in TonEBPf/f mice, we will determine if suppression causes alterations in T1? signal, matrix composition and biomechanical properties of the disc. Finally, using a well characterized rat model of disc disease, we will attempt to restore TonEBP expression/activity using either PDGF-BB or ANG II and monitor changes. Outcomes from these studies will provide foundation for innovative strategies aimed at restoring osmotic and water balance mediated through TonEBP, thereby delaying the development or progression of degenerative disc disease in the aging spine."
"9462782","Core F: Neuroimaging Core Abstract:  The overall goal of the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (PITT-ADRC) is to perform and promote research that increases our understanding of: 1) the etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 2) the mechanisms underlying the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of AD, and 3) to develop strategies that will result in effective early diagnoses and treatments for AD and related dementias. The Neuroimaging Core will support these Center-wide goals by developing and applying cutting edge neuroimaging technology to studies that are focused on early and presymptomatic stages of the AD spectrum.  As the search for preclinical biomarkers continues, it is becoming increasingly clear that functional and structural brain imaging data may hold the key to identifying the earliest pathological manifestations of AD prior to any meaningful clinical change. The Neuroimaging Core will continue to develop and distribute technology for acquiring and interpreting brain functional and structural imaging data in the support of AD research. The Core will advance the Center goals by supporting and promoting research that increases our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of AD, and facilitates the development of new therapies and methods for monitoring therapeutic efficacy. The Core maintains data sets of structural imaging on individuals enrolled through the Clinical Core (currently 934 MRI datasets), and we continue to work on the expansion of leading edge analytic technologies, and novel radiotracer ligands measured with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (i.e., PiB and T807, Projects 1 and 2). Our developmental work includes the high definition quantification of white matter fiber tracts, and measurement of functional networks based on high resolution functional imaging. We will validate and implement methodologies and statistical techniques (e.g., functional connectivity, data mining) in order to provide ADRC investigators with state-of-the-art tools."
"9605694","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Human brain complexity is considered unique, yet the genesis of many neuronal and glial sub-types and their migration and integration into functional circuits in neonates remains poorly understood. Moreover, these processes are likely disrupted in hypoxic neurological injuries, which can result in death, cerebral palsy and/or long-term cognitive disabilities. The proposed program focuses on human interneuron (IN) and oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) development during 3rd trimester (24-40 weeks) gestation, and whether lineage ontogeny, migration and differentiation is regulated by oxygen levels and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. This program is an outgrowth of the investigators common interests, productive collaborations and the close association of their laboratories in the recently built Ray and Dagmar Dolby Building in the Eli and Edythe Broad Institute for Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCSF. The investigators have studied the human fetal and newborn brain and recently identified (1) the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), (2) chain migration of young neurons of medial migratory stream (MMS) and (3) the impact of injury on oligodendrocyte development in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). We propose three projects and cores to promote an understanding of human brain development and injury. Project 1 investigates migration of young INs to focal regions of human newborn brain, their differentiation and the developmental impact of oxygen- regulated pathways. Project 2 will define structure and OPC production of the human OSVZ from 24-40 weeks gestation, and regulation of lineage ontogeny by oxygen levels. Project 3 will provide direct evidence for HIF pathway activation in IN and OPC populations in human neonates with HIE, and cell-intrinsic functions of HIF pathway genes during pre- and post-natal IN and OPC development. The administrative core (A) provides budgetary oversight, coordination and access to resources. All projects will use primary human neuropathological specimens for histological analysis supported by a neuropathology core (B). All projects will employ animal experimental systems. Based on compelling preliminary data, we propose an animal model core (C) to support studies in neonatal ferret brain."

"9457298","Summary: Core D Animals The Animal Core is central to the Program Project, performing bioassay experiments for Projects 1, 2, 3 and 4, and supplying tissues to the Neuropathology core (Core C), and tail biopsies to the Science core (Core B) for screening. The Animal Core will provide the following services: the highest quality animal and veterinary care; breeding of transgenic and knockout mice; experimental inoculations, and neurologic scoring of animals; bioluminescence imaging; behavioral assessments; tissue collection and storage; transportation of animals and tissues between the animal facility and the laboratory; microinjection of DNA constructs to generate new transgenic lines; and cryopreservation of new transgenic mouse lines. The demonstration that inoculation of A and tau aggregates can initiate self-propagation in the appropriate mouse model is a clear analogy to the prion diseases. However a major limitation of the A and tau inoculation models is that the mice don't show any overt clinical signs, and the only way of determining the degree of disease progression is to remove the brain for biochemical and neuropathological analysis. Our pioneering work in the field of bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaing has allowed us to address this issue and monitor disease progression in vivo. We have developed transgenic mouse models incorporating a luciferase reporter, enabling monitoring by BLI, for propagation of the prion protein (PrP) and A, and NIR fluorescent ligands that bind to tau. These provide a suite of tools to determine the biological relevance of protein and peptide aggregates formed in the Projects of this grant."
"9444600","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, heterogeneous autoimmune disease that disproportionally affects women and the disease is often more severe with end-organ damage in non-white populations. Few effective treatments exist for SLE, largely because the etiology is incompletely understood; however, the disease is likely to occur in genetically susceptible individuals upon environmental triggers. Multiple genome wide association studies (GWAS) and replication studies have identified ~100 (80 published and 20 in the publishing process) SLE susceptibility loci (P<5x10-8) using mainly European- and Asian-derived populations. Our recent Korean GWAS and other published studies of Asians have implicated a number of autophagy- related gene loci in SLE, similar to several other autoimmune diseases. Autophagy is an intracellular process that transports damage cytoplasmic organelles, macromolecular aggregates, or intracellular pathogens to the lysosome for degradation and recycling. Autophagy cross talks with the immune system and controls inflammation through effects on various immune cells to regulate immune homeostasis and to modulate host defenses. Fine mapping autophagy-related gene loci associated with SLE is necessary to gain understanding how these genetic variants affect different aspects of autophagy pathways in specific immune cell types, which may serve as a new drug target for SLE treatment. Due to linkage disequilibrium (LD), each risk locus contains multiple variants, and in some cases, multiple genes that could impact biologic functions relating to SLE pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we propose to utilize LD structure differences between Asian and African-derived ancestries to conduct transracially fine-mapping and bioinformatics analysis of seven SLE risk loci related to autophagy (ATG16L2-FCHSD2-P2RY2, PRDM1-ATG5, DRAM1, CDKN1B, CLEC16A, NCF2 and HIP1) using the Global Screening Array (GSA) that contains headroom for custom variants in SLE cases and controls of non-white minorities (4000 Asians and 3000 African Americans [AA]). By comparing haplotype structures and applying Bayesian approaches, we will obtain the best credible set of variants to pursue further. In Aim 2, we will refine credible variant list by using bioinformatics and molecular approaches to identify functional variants. This will include sorting immune cell subsets from 100 AA SLE patients and 100 AA controls (matched for age and gender) for RNA-seq and qRT-PCR to correlate allelic genotypes with differential gene expression and splicing as well as conducting molecular biology assays. The best candidates will be further tested in Aim 3 to conduct immunophenotyping, RNA-seq and autophagy functional assays to assess the consequences of gene- edited immune cell lines and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which will determine the pertinent cell subset from SLE patients and controls to conduct autophagy functional assays for confirmation of genotypic effects. Our results will identify genetic variants underlying SLE risk loci and their molecular/cellular mechanisms leading to dysregulation of autophagy pathways contributing to the development of SLE."
"9471880","The long-term goal of the Mentored Career Development component (KL2) of our CTSC is to build the capacity of our faculty to perform clinical and translational research (CTR), thereby addressing the significant health problems of New Mexico, the region, and the nation. Our short-term objective is to enhance our KL2 program by strengthening recruitment, augmenting individualized training, and improving mentoring to ensure that scholars become independently funded by the end of their K-award period. A parallel KL2-like program, open to additional faculty, with the same requirements, resources and training environment, has also been developed with funds made available to our CTSC (not an institutional match). The success of our KL2 program demonstrates the important role of our CTSC in catalyzing CTR training, thereby strategically increasing CTR capacity. The rationale for our approach is that by building on our already successful KL2 program, we will continue to develop the next generation of accomplished clinical and translational researchers. We will accomplish this with the following specific aims: 1) Continue robust and sustained leadership, administration, and institutional environment and commitment to the KL2 program; 2) Perform national searches for KL2 scholars that include enhanced processes: a) to match recruits with optimal training environments within our Signature Programs and departments, and b) to identify a racially/ethnically diverse pool of candidates; 3) Develop, use, and monitor individual career development plans (IDP) that articulate annual milestones and pathways for career development for five to ten years; 4) Enhance KL2 scholar mentoring by requiring local-mentor training, adding mentors to the Multidisciplinary Advisory Committee, and expanding the mentor team to include career mentors, peer mentors and, where appropriate, external mentors who are nationally recognized experts in their fields, and; 5) Implement a comprehensive evaluation process, including formative and summative components, for assessment of KL2 scholars, mentors, and the program. The expected outcome of our program will be an enhanced capacity to conduct CTR on the most important problems facing New Mexico, our region and the nation. We will attain this through heightened attention to the factors that improve recruitment, training, mentoring and career development of a new cadre of young, independently funded, and team science-oriented scientists. Such outcomes are expected to have an important, long-term positive impact on our institution and the CTR workforce, resulting in a generation of scientists trained in CTR; thereby promoting the nation?s priority to significantly accelerate the translation of discovery into impact on health."
"9551521","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the 10 most common malignancies in both men and women. Since 2009, over 30,000 Veterans have been diagnosed with this malignancy. Unfortunately, progress in the treatment of patients with advanced disease has been incremental, and new treatment approaches are warranted. Altered metabolism, an established hallmark of malignancy, may provide novel therapeutic opportunities. However, the molecular mechanisms by which kidney tumors remodel metabolism remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence demonstrates coordinated remodeling of mitochondrial metabolic pathways in renal cancer, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. This remodeling could lead to a shift toward glycolysis (i.e. the Warburg phenotype). The long-term goal is to identify the molecular basis by which kidney cancer remodels metabolism and to use this knowledge to rationally develop new therapeutic approaches that improve patient outcomes. The objective of this proposal is to define the transcriptional basis by which RCC remodels mitochondrial metabolism and to determine the effects on tumorigenesis. Our central hypothesis is that epigenetic silencing of the transcription factor PRDM16 (PRD1-BF1-RIZ1 homologous domain containing 16) promotes a metabolic switch in RCC that drives tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data of patient-derived samples (normal kidney, primary tumor, and metastatic tumor deposits) by the applicant's laboratory that demonstrates PRDM16 loss among the most significantly altered gene expression changes in this malignancy. The rationale for the proposed studies is that understanding the molecular basis by which tumor metabolic remodeling occurs will uncover compensatory pathways and vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically exploited. Our central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data, will be tested through pursuit of the following specific aims: 1) Determine the transcriptional basis by which PRDM16 regulates the expression of TCA cycle enzymes; 2) Determine the mechanisms by which PRDM16 loss promotes a shift in tumor metabolism; and 3) Determine the epigenetic basis by which PRDM16 is lost in RCC and the contribution of this loss to tumorigenesis. The proposed research is significant because it will identify novel drivers of the metabolic shift in RCC in the context of targetable pathways. The approach is innovative because it will establish a link between the epigenome and tumor metabolism. Ultimately, the knowledge gathered has the potential to improve the efficacy of treatment for Veterans with advanced RCC, an unmet need challenging the contemporary management of this disease."
"9684530","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application proposes to continue the cancer prevention programs of the University of Kentucky PRC, the only PRC dedicated to cancer prevention in rural Appalachia. Known locally as the Rural Cancer Prevention Center (RCPC), our past focus has been on the prevention (through vaccination) and early detection of cervical cancer. Through social marketing and planned outreach the RCPC has successfully leveraged the trust of rural people residing in the most economically depressed area of Appalachia (southeastern, KY). The proposed renewal offers plans to continue our community-based cancer prevention research, and to extend our programs to other regions of Appalachia, using sustainable models. Moreover, the previous research pertaining to cervical cancer prevention created a strong basis for testing a novel approach to community-based screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). Based on new screening technology, this approach will be effective and accessible to medically disenfranchised and under-served rural residents. The proposed plan has 5 general aims (A-E) and a specific research aim (F): A) Provide infrastructure and administrative services that support cancer prevention; B) Build community capacity and actively engage the community in partnerships for cancer prevention; C) Provide an efficient and effective communications network that ties cancer prevention activities together and disseminates health communication; D) Offer training and technical support to state and local agencies; E) Evaluate (process and outcome) all planned activities related to aims A-D; and F) Conduct an applied prevention research project that demonstrates the value of using community change agents to foster widespread adoption of annual colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), followed by navigation to colonoscopy for those screening FIT-positive, and by an intervention program that promote annual repeat use of FIT. All six aims are inter-related; however, the final aim is a highly focused set of activities that occur in two phases: 1) the programs supporting this aim will be tested in Years 1-3, and 2) to benefit other rural Appalachian states, dissemination and implementation activities will be conducted in Years 4-5. Programs to be tested in Years 1-3 include 1) a community-based intervention featuring a Diffusion of Innovations model, standard RCPC outreach methods, and academic detailing for health care providers tested using a non-equivalent comparison design; this trial will end when 500 FIT specimens have been returned in the intervention health district, 2) a social network analysis (N = 64) used to provide interim feedback regarding key characteristics of effective change agents used in the diffusion model, 3) a navigation program (based on current RCPC practices for cervical cancer) that will be applied to people testing FIT-positive (N = 60), and 4) an internet-based program designed to foster annual repeat FIT screening tested using a randomized, controlled trial design (N = 220). Programs will be designed for optimal sustainability and dissemination/implementation potential."
"9521079","ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-nave first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication nave and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology."
"9491761","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a request for a 5-year renewal of grant R13DA19790. The College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD) is the oldest standing scientific organization devoted to research on drug abuse. The aim of the Annual Meeting of CPDD is to provide a forum at which the latest findings in research in the area of drug abuse are presented, and where formal and informal exchange of information and ideas takes place among researchers in the field. The annual meeting draws together the most outstanding scientists in all facets of the field, including molecular biology, genetics, medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, behavior, neuroimmunology, treatment, prevention, and epidemiology. Papers include reports about all drugs being abused or having potential for abuse, including opioids, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, nicotine, cannabis, inhalants, hallucinogens, club/designer drugs, prescription drugs, alcohol and sedative hypnotics. Topics also include related diseases and conditions such as HIV/AIDS and psychiatric comorbidity. The CPDD Annual Meeting attracts basic and clinical researchers from about 50 countries, at all levels from predoctoral students through senior investigators, as well as representatives from government and industry. The CPDD meeting is the one meeting that brings together researchers studying all aspects and approaches to the problems of drug abuse and addiction. No other meeting covers the breadth of research in the drug abuse field. There are 5 days of scientific sessions made up of volunteer oral presentations, poster sessions, 15-18 symposia, and 8-12 workshops.

"9537573","ABSTRACT (Project 2: Brusseau, Field, Maier, Chorover)  Surface-water and groundwater contamination from acid rock drainage is one of the primary environmental concerns for many hardrock mining sites in the USA. Concomitantly, cost-effective treatment of mining-impacted waters to levels protective of human health and the environment is a critical issue for mitigating the risk associated with hardrock mining sites. The overall goals of this project are to investigate the key physical and biogeochemical processes that control migration and attenuation of mine-drainage contaminants in groundwater, and to develop and test innovative methods for remediation of contaminated groundwater at hardrock mining sites. The project incorporates innovative methods to examine the biogeochemical processes that control contaminant behavior, with a focus on the unique properties and conditions inherent to mining sites in the Southwestern US. The project targets the primary groundwater contaminants of concern at these sites, including arsenic, uranium, and sulfate. This project will advance the state of the science regarding the transport and attenuation of metal(loids) in the subsurface. This will improve the development and parameterization of advanced biogeochemical models, and enhance the accuracy of risk assessments. The project outcomes will also improve the design and implementation of groundwater remediation efforts. Specifically, in-situ biosequestration is one of the very few options that exist for remediation of the large, deep groundwater contaminant plumes that form at hardrock mining sites in the Southwestern US. This method has great potential, but several critical questions exist as barriers to widespread acceptance and adoption. This project will answer these questions. It is anticipated that the application of project outcomes will produce significant cost savings for the clean-up of the nation's inventory of mine waste sites."
"9553355","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Abstract Insulin resistance and the resultant glucose intolerance are central to the pathophysiology of acquired diabetes, common health issues among veterans. Insulin resistance is also a powerful independent risk factor and a common co-morbidity in cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of insulin resistance in multiple tissues associated diabetes and other diseases suggest a potential common mechanism of impaired glucose transport. We believe that we have identified a critical missing link between impaired insulin regulation and diabetes. Our data suggest that poorly balanced input from the brain via the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system may underlie disruption of both glucose metabolism and cardiovascular function. I will explore a novel mechanism by which insulin regulates glucose uptake in a beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR)-dependent manner and elucidate the contribution of this mechanism to the development of insulin resistance, the fundamental cause of Type II diabetes. I hypothesize that activation of a newly characterized insulin receptor/ beta2AR complex by insulin traffics a specific subcellular pool of activated Akt via transactivation of a beta2AR/Gi/PI3K cascade, which is essential for translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface for glucose uptake. Our evidence suggests that this novel IR/beta2AR complex may hold the key to understanding insulin resistance in diverse tissues associated with diabetes. My ultimate goal is to advance the understanding of the pathophysiology of insulin resistance by identifying previously unidentified mechanisms involved in insulin-induced mobilization of GLUT4. These studies have the potential to lead to entirely new therapeutic targets to increase insulin sensitivity, of which relatively few agents currently exist."
"9551505","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This proposal seeks to link two important risk factors for type 2 diabetes, tissue iron stores and disruption of the circadian rhythm. Large epidemiologic studies have shown that dietary iron is a significant risk factor for diabetes. More recently, intervention studies have shown that the risk s causal and reversible. The body of work from our laboratory in the past decade has shown several mechanisms by which iron affects metabolism, including damaging -cells, down regulating adiponectin and leptin, and mediating multiple effects on the signaling pathways that regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. A second nonconventional risk factor for diabetes is disruption of the circadian rhythm of metabolism. Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for environmental changes. They coordinate metabolic changes needed as we shift from being asleep to being awake, from fasting to being fed, and from storing energy to using energy. It is therefore not surprising that many studies have shown these rhythms' importance to obesity and diabetes, whose pathogenesis incorporates derangements of all of those processes. Disruption of this normal cycle is felt to be a major factor in the increased prevalence of diabetes and obesity among night shift workers. Our work in the previous funding period has demonstrated that dietary iron, even within the broad range of normal, has significant effects on the circadian clock, specifically the shift from hepatic gluconeogenesis to hepatic fuel storage. In the course of these studies, it also emerged that dietary iron also affected the circadian rhythmicity of thermoregulation.  Besides iron, another important input to the regulation of these cycles is oxygen. These two factors are necessary for fuel metabolism, so their availability needs to be part of the regulation of this fundamental rhythm. Deficiencies i both are common: Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disease in the world, and hypoxia occurs commonly in diabetes, both systemically (associated with sleep apnea) as well as in tissues such as fat that outgrow their blood/oxygen supply in obesity. With deficiency of either, the organism must respond by limiting oxidative metabolism, which in turn will limit thermogenesis and the normal oscillations of body temperature that entrain the circadian clock. When in excess, we have shown that iron may also allow escape from the constraints of those rhythms, but at the expense of increased levels of oxidant stress. Importantly, we have shown that these effects occur across the very broad range of normal dietary iron intake and tissue iron levels. Thus, once the effects of different levels of dietary iron are understood, we will be able to verify the same effects in humans and begin to determine the optimal levels of iron that will best prevent obesity and diabetes. (In fact, we are currently working on a clinical trial to teat diabetes with bloodletting.) At the same time, we will uncover novel targets that can be potentially used to treat those conditions. This application builds upon our discoveries on the mechanisms and importance of dietary iron in the circadian rhythm of gluconeogenesis, and extends them into studies of thermoregulation, brown adipose function, and the novel underlying signaling mechanisms, including generation of microRNAs,"
"9465236","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-range goals of this proposal are to develop robust and reproducible methods for ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation as options for fertility preservation in survivors of cancer or other benign conditions wherein ovaria function is compromised. While 80% of young patients currently survive their cancers, devastating side effects of chemo- or radiotherapies leave female survivors facing infertility due to ovarian failure. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue remains the only option for prepubertal, adolescent and young women with cancer as well as adult patients for whom immediate cancer therapy is required. But, human ovarian tissue cryopreservation is considered experimental and hampered by several factors. Embryology clinics in the U.S. favor embryo and oocyte vitrification over slow-rate freezing, but there is no uniform protocol for vitrification of ovaria tissue. Although 30 human births have been reported from slow-rate freezing and transplantation to orthotopic sites, only 4 could claim that the transplanted tissue was known to be the source of the oocytes. Most young survivors will not have a healthy ovarian vascular bed as a transplantation site following cancer therapies. Cryopreservation is also the only option for patients contraindicated for ovarian transplantation due to the risk of reintroducing malignant cells. While in vitro follicle culture is under development, most studies use follicles isolated frm non-cryopreserved tissues. We successfully devised a method for vitrification of rhesus monkey ovarian tissue in a closed system, and demonstrated post-thaw function in vivo and in vitro. When transplanted to heterotopic sites, vitrified tissue resumes ovarian function, and yields mature oocytes capable of preimplantation embryonic development. Secondary follicles isolated from vitrified tissue and encapsulated for 3-dimensional (3D) culture survive, grow to antral stages and produce steroid hormones in vitro, but oocyte quality is poor. Since the ovarian cortex is composed of complex cell types that complicate cryopreservation, vitrification of individual follicles and subsequent 3D culture is a novel approach toward preserving gametes for young patients with highly invasive cancers. An elite panel of co-investigators and collaborators that bring expertise in both state-of-the-art cryobiology as well as pre-eminent experience in clinical ovarian transplantation will help us advance the current technology for more rapid translation to clinical practice for patients. Using the rhesus monkey, we propose to identify the transplantation site for optimal fertile function of both prepubertal and young adult ovarian cortical tissue, improve long-term transplant function via local administration of factors important for revascularization as well as follicular survival, and optimize vitrification of isolaed preantral follicles and their ability to yield competent oocytes following 3D culture in vitro. Liv births in nonhuman primates after these controlled studies will establish the safety and feasibilit of experimental therapies prior to clinical translation so girls and young women can be offered the best chances of becoming mothers after surviving cancer."
"9457430","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ubiquity of cortico-cortical feedback connections argues strongly for their importance, and theoreticians routinely make use of them in models of cortical function. Despite this, next to nothing is known about their function. Previous studies in which feedback has been manipulated have been performed in anesthetized animals, and our recent studies in alert animals have revealed fundamentally different results. Our major finding from the previous cycle is that feedback from V2 exerts minimal effects on the classically defined receptive field center of V1 neurons: orientation tuning and the center's contrast response function are virtually unaffected. However, larger stimuli that engage the receptive field surround and that normally cause suppression, cause much less suppression when V2 is inactivated. We have further discovered that the influence of feedback is on the spatial extent of the surround, rather than on its gain, and that seemingly higher order properties of surround suppression, such as feature- matched suppression, are more strongly influenced by feedback than is basic normalization. All of these observations are consistent with a theoretical framework of predictive coding, which posits a key computational role for the interaction between feedforward and feedback connections. We now propose to examine specific examples ranging from built-in contextual influences in form and motion perception to the nature of changes that underlie the learning of a perceptual task. Our general approach will be to use causal manipulations-reversible inactivation of cortical areas (V2 and/or MT) that feed back to V1-to test the hypothesized role of top-down influences in perceptual inference. Our studies will shed light on the basic mechanisms of cortical function."

"9451182","Periodontal disease (PD) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) have many features in common. PD is a chronic in?ammatory disease of the periodontium, the soft and hard tissues supporting the teeth, and is characterized by the destruction of the alveolar bone as a result of the chronic bacterial challenge and a compromised immune response. RA is a chronic in?ammatory disease of the diarthrodial joints which results in reduced mobility. Both diseases exhibit a strong genetic component, the ?shared epitope? (SE) HLA-DR?1 as well as a lifestyle component such as tobacco use, a lifestyle choice that is prevalent among veterans. We have previously demonstrated that when the shared epitope is added as a transgene to a mouse that is known not to be susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), this mouse (B10.M) becomes susceptible to CIA. C57BL/6 (B6) mice have been described as not being susceptible to bone loss or oral colonization with the putative PD pathogen, the gram negative anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis in studies of PD. We have engineered a B6 mouse to express a chimeric mouse/human SE as a transgene in the absence of its murine class II (B6.DR1 mouse), and we have begun studies to determine if expression of this HLA-DR?1 transgene can provide the B6 mouse with the appropriate set of susceptibility genes necessary for colonization with P. gingivalis and for all the pathways that lead to bone destruction. The overarching goal of this program of study is to directly address the mechanistic basis behind the association between periodontitis and the development of arthritis. We hypothesize that periodontitis in the context of permissive tissue types (such as those bearing the SE) will provide the necessary pPAD enzymes to promote host protein citrulline modi?cations that drive T cell development and subsequent ACPA production. We further hypothesize that ACPAs form immune complexes that enhance vascular permeability and allow binding of any number of joint speci?c antibodies to the cartilage where innate mechanisms such as complement and FcR binding to propagate arthritis. This study is signi?cant because it has very important implications for veterans bearing the shared epitope. Should our hypothesis prove correct, it will suggest that aggressive preventative measures including a more pro-active periodontal screening with an enhanced frequency of visits may be necessary to prevent arthritis in veterans bearing any allelic variation of the shared epitope. This might also include arthritis that develops following acute injury to the joint. Our preliminary data demonstrate 1) that we can establish an Pg oral infection model in the humanized B6.DR1 mice and that the bacteria are present for a prolong period in the oral cavity, and can be detected in the blood stream, 2) that infection of the oral cavity induces an immune response that can be detected by the presence of ACPA, the generation of Th17 cells, and the induction of several proin?ammatory cytokines, 3) that the ACPA response is dependent on the expression of the HLA-DR1 molecule, 4) that Pg infection leads to signi?cant bone loss both in periodontal bones as well as peri- articular bones, and 5) Pg infection induces the development of autoimmune arthritis in mice that have an established autoimmune response but otherwise lack overt signs of disease. Collectively, these data provide critical evidence in support of our primary hypothesis, and the speci?c aims we propose to use to test this hypothesis."
"9505784","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: This application for a Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) addresses the important issue of racial disparities in both risk and severity for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe acute critical illness with a high mortality rate (~30%) affecting up to 200,000 US patients each year. Subjects of African descent exhibit increased ARDS risk and higher ARDS mortality compared with non- Hispanic whites. It has been increasingly appreciated that genetic factors participate in determining predisposition to ARDS and may contribute to observed health disparities. Additionally, an understanding of genetic determinants of ARDS susceptibility will hasten the development of novel personalized preventive and therapeutic approaches to ARDS care. The PI for this K08 application is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Arizona who aspires to a career focused on translational ARDS research related to deciphering the genetic and non-genetic factors that underlie the observed health disparities in critical care and to exploring personalized therapies in ARDS. The PI has clinical training in pulmonary and critical care medicine, as well as training and experience in the design and conduct of clinical trials. He now proposes to extend the reach and scope of his research towards a translational systems biology program in ARDS and critical care. Under the mentorship of Joe GN Garcia MD, a world-renowned physician-scientist in the field of ARDS, genetics, and health disparities, the PI has generated important preliminary data implicating the selectin P ligand (SELPLG) gene and its encoded protein, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1) as novel susceptibility targets for ARDS in individuals of African descent. The proposed research will employ a focused and comprehensive systems biology approach to test the hypothesis that SELPLG and PSGL1 are novel ARDS targets with genetic variants that confer ARDS susceptibility. Specific Aim #1 (SA #1) will characterize the regulation of SELPLG expression by ARDS stimuli and carefully-selected SELPLG promoter SNPs on SELPLG gene promoter activity SA #2 will characterize effects of SELPLG coding SNPs on PSGL1 activity in preclinical models of ARDS. Finally, SA #3 will assess the association of selectin pathway gene SNPs with ARDS risk and mortality utilizing the Sequenom MassARRAY genotyping platform on a diverse well- phenotyped cohort of ARDS patient DNA samples (>2,000) and healthy controls (race-matched) from the DNA repository stored within our University of Arizona biobank. Thus, the K08-suported training in advanced genetics, functional genomics, bioinformatic analysis, and lung injury biology, will have high translational therapeutic implications and will enhance the likelihood that the PI will successfully transition to an independent research career focused on translational ARDS and health disparities."
"9457160","The current research focus of the nominee is two-fold: The first is to delineate a unique molecular mechanism regulating functional activity of osteoclasts that involves negative regulation of the expression of a distinctive osteoclastic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP-oc), which is a potent activator of functional activity of mature osteoclasts, by microRNA-17 (miR17). This project is supported by a BLR&D Merit Review award and seeks to test 3 hypotheses: 1) resorption cytokines activates osteoclasts via suppression of miR17 expression; 2) conditional deletion of miR17 in osteoclasts increases PTP-oc expression, which in turn stimulates osteoclast activity via up-regulation of the PTP-oc signaling; and 3) conditional overexpression of miR17 in osteoclasts reduces PTP-oc expression and inhibits physiologically- and pathologically-induced bone resorption. It has three Aims: Aim 1 tests the first hypothesis by determining if treatment with resorption modulators regulates the promoter activity of miR17 in osteoclasts; demonstrating direct effects of resorption modulators on transcription of the miR17~92 gene; and performing ChIP-seq analysis to identify key transcription factors. Aim 2 tests the second hypothesis by characterizing the in vivo and in vitro bone and osteoclast phenotypes of osteoclast miR17~92 conditional knockout mice, determining effects of miR17~92 deficiency on PTP-oc mRNA level, the PTP-oc signaling, and resorption activity of osteoclasts, and determining whether re-introduction of miR17 into miR17~92 deficient osteoclasts would ?restore? the osteoclast phenotype; and evaluating effects of miR17~92 deficiency on osteoclast differentiation. Aim 3 tests the third hypothesis by generating transgenic mice with conditional overexpression of miR17~92 in osteoclasts by crossing LysM-Cre mice with mice harboring the miR17~92 transgene downstream to a loxP-flanked Neo-STOP cassette at the ROSA locus, determining the effects of conditional overexpression of miR17~92 in osteoclasts on bone and osteoclast phenotypes, and if overexpression of miR17~92 in osteoclasts would blunt the ovariectomy- and calcium depletion-induced bone resorption. This work should yield insights into how mature osteoclast activity is regulated, which is important in our overall understanding of the pathophysiology of various subtypes of osteoporosis and bone-wasting diseases. It may also provide novel drug targets (e.g., miR17) for screening of small molecular compounds for use to develop effective anti-resorption therapies for certain subtypes of osteoporosis. The second focus is to develop an innovative EphA4-based small molecular therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat osteoarthritis (OA) and posttraumatic OA (PTOA). This project is funded by a DoD Idea Development award. The rationale of this project is based on the exciting discovery of an opposing regulatory effects of the forward signaling of EphA4 on osteoclasts (inhibiting bone resorption) as opposed to on chondrocytes (promoting cartilage biogenesis). This project seeks to capitalize these unique opposing actions of the EphA4 forward signaling on osteoclasts vs. chondrocytes to develop a novel strategy that would simultaneously reduce degradation of articular cartilage/subchondral bone and enhance regeneration of articular cartilage. It has three Aims. Aim 1 determines whether treatment of monocytes/macrophages/synoviocytes isolated from PTOA synovium with soluble EfnA4-fc protein suppresses secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and degradative enzymes, and if treatment of articular chondrocytes with EfnA4-fc would promote chondrocyte proliferation, maturation, and survival in vitro. Aim 2 seeks to develop and optimize an EphA4-binding EfnA-fc-based strategy, which involves direct intra-articular injection of a soluble EfhA-fc chimeric protein into the OA/PTOA joint. Aim 3 determines if administration of the optimized EfnA-fc-based strategy to the PTOA/OA synovium joint shortly after the creation of an intra-articular tibial plateau fracture in the knee prevents degradation of articular cartilage, and if this optimized EfnA-fc-based therapeutic strategy promotes regeneration of articular cartilage. This work should provide feasibility evidence for this EphA4-based therapeutic therapy for PTOA/OA."
"9685077","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Suicide, a primary cause of death among middle-aged men (35-64 years old), is the leading cause of injury death among men in this age group in Michigan (state where study takes place). Reliance on traditional mental health services to reach out to and engage men in this age group has not resulted in increased suicide problem recognition or help-seeking behavior. While effective treatment for suicide exists, treatment cannot help men who don't identify as having a problem, and therefore don't see help. The field lacks effective and efficient programs and interventions that actively engage middle-aged men in evidence-based interventions to increase suicide problem identification and help-seeking behavior. We will examine the effectiveness of a comprehensive online screening and referral intervention, specifically designed for men ages 35-64. Primary outcomes include suicide behavior (suicide attempts and preparatory acts), suicide ideation and depression. Secondary outcomes include: attitudes toward help-seeking and help-seeking behavior; suicide risk factors (i.e., alcohol abuse, relationship conflicts, financial problems and interpersonal needs7); and the protective factor of social support. Men who score in the moderate-to-high risk range for depression on the depression screen, or any score for suicide ideation and/or behavior on the suicide screen, will be asked to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Screening for Mental Health; or Screening for Mental Health, plus Man Therapy. Man Therapy is specifically designed for men who are at risk for suicide and less likely to engage in help-seeking behavior. A series of data analysis techniques will be used to evaluate the additive effect of Man Therapy. The core analysis will be a longitudinal mixed-model path analysis testing for between-group and within-group differences on primary and secondary outcomes. The model design will also include estimations of indirect effects (mediation and moderation). Data will be collected on primary outcomes of depression and suicidal behavior and ideation at baseline and then again at 2- and 12-weeks post randomization to study arm. Secondary outcomes will be measured 2- and 12-weeks post randomization to study arm. Using a sequential mixed-methods research design, researchers will interview a purposive sub-sample of men referred to both study arms to further assess and compare barriers and facilitators to men seeking suicide prevention services. This innovative study, which can be widely applicable to other states across the country, may advance suicide prevention among middle-aged men, a high-risk group for suicide who tend to be difficult to engage in suicide problem identification and help-seeking behavior."
"9431042","Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen responsible for an increasing number of infections in VA, civilian and military hospitals. This proposal will address a novel mechanism that regulates virulence in A. baumannii. This mechanism involves a molecular switch that interconverts A. baumannii between virulent and avirulent states. Cells in the virulent state grow as opaque colonies when viewed by indirect oblique lighting. In contrast, the avirulent form produces translucent colonies that are rapidly killed in-vivo by host defenses. The central component of this regulation is a transcriptional regulator (ABUW_1645) that acts as a bistable switch to drive the differentiation from opaque to translucent states. In addition, a peptide-based quorum sensing system activates the expression of this regulator through a two-component system when cells approach high density. The completion of our work will result in a greater understanding of this novel regulatory pathway that controls virulence. This information along with the strains constructed in this proposal will pave the way for the development of high- throughput screens to identify small molecules that either drive cells from the opaque (virulent) to the translucent (avirulent) state, or block the ability of translucent cells to switch to opaque. Ultimately, these inhibitors may result in the development of novel therapies to disable virulence in this increasingly important bacterial pathogen."
"9552682","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Heart failure is the number one reason for discharge for Veterans treated in VA health care system. Heart failure, measured at the organ level, is the result of cellular failure due to impairment of cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. One key structural component of E-C coupling is the myocyte transverse (T)-tubule system. T-tubules play essential roles in membrane excitation, coordinated and synchronized activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release, and muscle contraction. In failing myocytes from animal models and human patients, we and others have shown that the regularly arrayed T-tubule system undergoes disruptive remodeling, leading to aberrant intracellular Ca2+ release and compromised myocyte contractility. Our recently published data strongly suggest that T-tubule structural integrity is a critical structural determinant of myocardial contractile function. Moreover, we found that loss of protein expression of junctophilin-2 (JP2), a structural protein spanning T-tubules and the SR membrane, is a causative factor in T-tubule deformation in heart disease. Substantial evidence demonstrates that E-C coupling is impaired by oxidative stress, which is elevated in cardiomyocytes in heart disease. Despite the clear role for oxidative stress in cardiomyopathies, antioxidant trials in humans have failed to provide a therapeutic benefit, suggesting an incomplete understanding of oxidative stress-mediated pathways in heart disease or possibly wrong antioxidant strategy used in previous clinical trials. Previous reports have provided solid evidence that protein kinase C (PKC) is activated by oxidative stress. At the cellular level, PKC has been shown to impair E-C coupling. In pilot studies, activation of PKC resulted in alterations in cardiomyocyte structure and function. However, in order to identify new treatment strategies for heart disease that preserve cardiac contractility, there is a critical need to determine the mechanism by which PKC activation by oxidative stress induces E-C coupling dysfunction. The objective/goal of this application is to determine the mechanistic link between excessive oxidative stress, PKC signaling, and development and progression of heart failure. We will combine multidisciplinary approaches including in situ confocal imaging, electrophysiology, molecular biology, pathological mouse models and novel transgenic mouse models to test our hypothesis. Accomplishment of our studies will advance our understanding and provide new insights into the mechanisms of oxidative stress-mediated PKC activation and T-tubule remodeling in heart failure pathophysiology and is expected to have an important positive impact by revealing new targets for heart failure therapeutics. Given that over the last decade the number of resources used to treat heart failure within the VA health care system has grown steadily, new treatments that both improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care associated with heart failure will provide significant benefit to the VA health care system."

The Imaging Core will leverage MADRC investigator expertise in molecular,  functional, and structural imaging and the state-of-the-art resources of the Martinos Center for Biomedical  Imaging and the Massachusetts General Hospital PET Core to augment our Center's strengths in cutting edge,  multi-modality imaging research. The Imaging Core will provide direct support for Project 1 (Hedden) and  Project 2 (Gomez-Isla) through volumetric and functional connectivity MRI and PET amyloid imaging data  acquisition and analyses. We will also continue to support the imaging components of other MADRC  investigator led projects, including ongoing NIH funded PPG, R01s, K23, multiple foundation grants and future  MADRC pilot grants. Working closely with the Clinical and Data Cores, the Imaging Core will support  standardized acquisition protocols and catalogued storage of neuroimaging data collected on subjects in the  MADRC Longitudinal Cohort participating in MADRC affiliated imaging research projects. We will also acquire  MRI (3T) and PET amyloid imaging on a small number of LC subjects of special interest to our center and will  provide these data to Projects 1 and 2, as well as to other MADRC affiliated studies with appropriate IRB  approval. We will facilitate the implementation of new PET tracers, currently being tested in affiliated projects,  including recently developed PET ligands for tau, inflammation, and mGluR5 into MADRC affiliated research  studies. Similarly, we will facilitate the implementation of novel MRI methods and analytic tools, such as  functional connectivity, the connectome scanner, and cortical thickness signatures into new and ongoing  MADRC projects. The Imaging Core will further enhance MADRC's active involvement in national multi-center  projects with major neuroimaging components, including ADNI, DIAN, NIFD, NIH and industry sponsored  multi-center clinical trials, including the upcoming ADCS Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic AD (A4) trial.  We will work closely with the Outreach Core to lead national efforts to educate the public and health care  professionals about the appropriate clinical use of PET amyloid imaging and with the ADCS and collaborating  ADRCs on important issues related to disclosure of amyloid status to research participants. We will provide  expertise on multi-modality image acquisition and analysis to young investigators interested in incorporating  neuroimaging into pilot projects and career development proposals. Neuroimaging is likely to play an even more  integral role in AD clinical research over the next 5 years. This new Imaging Core will work closely with the  existing MADRC cores, substantially augment our ability to provide frontline support to MADRC affiliated  imaging studies, including two of the research projects proposed for the renewal, and will facilitate new  collaborations both within our Center and with other ADCs."
"9465229","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes The National Dental PBRN (NDPBRN), a national collaborative of practices and organizations across the United States that will engage practitioners in the excitement of discovery for the benefit of everyday clinical practice and its patients. Consistent with specifications in the RFA itself, the Specific Aims will be to: (1) support the infrastructure and conduct of national oral health research studies in dental practices on topics of importance to practitioners; (2) provide evidence useful in daily patient care; (3) facilitate the translation of research findings into clinical practice. NDPBRN also will aim to broaden the scope of dental practice via certain studies to better integrate dental practice into the larger health care system, and to reach out further to dental education to inculcate in graduating clinicians an appreciation for the role of science in everyday  clinical practice. NDPBRN will measure and document this change and the network's impact on bringing about change in everyday clinical practice.

"9551575","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Phenotypic heterogeneity in small cell lung cancer. Abstract. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) constitutes a group of malignancies responsible for the about 24,000 cancer deaths every year in the United States. Little progress has been made in decreasing SCLC mortality. Gene expression and mutation profiling efforts to identify driver mutations, gene amplifications, or signatures with clinical utility in SCLC have been limited and thus far been unfruitful. Our preliminary data point towards the existence of subclasses of SCLCs and new therapeutic targets. Based on these preliminary data we hypothesize that discovering the temporality, frequency and nature of primary and secondary mutations associated with tumor progression, the characterization of a small number of subpopulations and their responses to drugs will lead to significant improvements in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of lung cancer. We propose to validate the two distinct phenotypes- neuroendocrine and mesenchymal- of SCLC within primary tumors. We will investigate the heterogeneity of the tumors based on fresh specimens by single cell mass Cytometry as it relates to their behavior. Our single cell analysis will inform us on the clonality of the lesions and intra-tumor heterogeneity. We will determine the temporality of events in tumorigenesis of SCLC in primary tumors and in tumors resisting chemotherapy. Whole genome sequencing and RNAseq analyses will be performed on these samples to assay tumor heterogeneity and compare before and after treatment as well as to identify changes specific to exceptional responders. Finally, we will interrogate in patient derive xenografts tumor heterogeneity in SCLCs who relapse after chemotherapy to discover new pathway activation and test new strategies for intervention including SYK and EPHA2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The ultimate goal of this translational research is to develop personalized management for patients presenting with SCLC. Phenotypic heterogeneity among cancer cells, observed even within single tumors, presents enormous challenges for developing optimal targeted treatment plans. We hope to uncover SCLC heterogeneity and its implications for chemotherapy. We hope to identify driver mutations and mutations that are uniquely associated with tumor progression, including therapy induced mutations. This will better inform the design of clinical trials and assist clinicians in tailoring treatment in individual patients."
"9670916","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Regeneration of sensory hair cells in the mature cochlea is a major therapeutic challenge. Atoh1, a transcription factor important for hair cell development, can induce hair cell formation from surrounding supporting cells in postnatal murine cochleae. However, hair cells regenerated by Atoh1 are too few, are incompletely mature, and most importantly, exhibit age-dependent decline in the postnatal cochlea. It remains unclear which molecules and signaling pathways modulate Atoh1-mediated conversion of supporting cells to hair cells in the mature cochlea in vivo. Our preliminary results demonstrate that genetic manipulation of additional factors, in conjunction with Atoh1 activation, in supporting cells can convert them to hair cells in the mature cochlea in vivo. Remarkably, we also showed that one of the three factors by itself can convert supporting cells to hair cells in te mature cochlea in vivo. Moreover, we have established RNA profiles of newly regenerated hair cells that identify transcription factors and signaling molecules that are likely involved in regulation of Atoh1-mediated hair cell regeneration in the mature cochlea. These novel and exciting findings led us to test whether combined genetic manipulation of these molecules would increase the efficiency of conversion of supporting cells to hair cells in the mature cochlea in vivo and determine the molecular mechanisms of such conversion. Direct conversion of supporting cells to hair cells is a key initial step toward hair cell regeneration and functional restoration of hearing. Our approach has been highly fruitful in generating new hair cells in vivo?both previously, in the postnatal cochlea, and now in the mature cochlea. For example, we have achieved a conversion rate of supporting cells to hair cells as high as 20% in vivo, a rate comparable to those in other regenerative systems such as adult pancreas, heart, and CNS. Our proposed studies will reveal 1) novel mechanisms of hair cell regeneration in the mature mammalian cochlea and 2) novel therapeutic targets for future clinical restoration of hearing."

"9527489","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by damage to alveolar epithelial barrier with subsequent pulmonary edema formation and profound hypoxia. Although there are many potential causes of ARDS, it is usually seen as a complication of mechanical ventilation in sepsis contributing to Multiple Organ Failure Syndrome. It is now recognized that injurious high tidal volume mechanical ventilation results in a condition called Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI) with pathological features identical to the early inflammatory phase of ARDS. VILI is thought to be a significant contributor to alveolar epithelial damage in ARDS. Human studies suggest that low-tidal volume ventilation reduces the chance of VILI. This observation led to the currently recommended ?lung protective ventilation strategies? but they offer only limited benefit because they cannot prevent alveolar over-distension and injury in the lung adjacent to the inflamed tissue.  It will be critical to develop new therapies to retain epithelial integrity in patients at risk of lung injury. We have identified and recently published that the Protein kinase RNA-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK)- activated Integrated Stress Response (ISR) intracellular signaling pathway has an important role in transmitting mechanical injury signals in the alveolar epithelium (Dolinay et al. AJRCMB 2017). We believe that further understanding of how this mechanical stress response pathway mediates barrier properties in the lung will provide us with new insights to the mechanism of injury and powerful levers to manipulate permeability.  Based on our findings, we hypothesize that 1) injurious mechanical ventilation activates the ISR in the epithelium, and that chemical or genetic inhibition of ISR mitigates lung injury during stretch (Aim 1); and 2) the inhibition of ISR activation preserves the epithelial barrier by preventing the stretch-induced barrier dysfunction (Aim 2). To explore the validity of our hypothesis, the candidate will first develop an epithelial cell specific PERK gene deleted mice and expose them to VILI. Tissue and cellular injury responses in PERK-deleted and control mice will be used to identify downstream target molecules that modulate epithelial permeability. Second, using our in vitro primary isolated epithelial cell model, the candidate will delineate the mechano-sensor function of PERK in response to stretch injury. Findings will expand our understanding of the cellular pathology of VILI and provide potential new targets to inhibit injury signaling. The coordinated research and training plan will develop the candidate?s experience in epithelial cell imaging, advanced gene expression analysis, development of a novel epithelial specific PERK knock out mouse, and will provide the candidate with key preliminary data for an independent R01 grant application focused on conducting preclinical trials to translate ISR inhibition from the bench to bedside."
"9444446","Women recently released from incarceration are rapidly growing in number and suffer from syndemic risk of HIV, substance use disorders (SUD), trauma, medical problems, and recidivism. In uncontrolled studies in a research setting, our gender and trauma-specific intervention grounded in the Self-Determination Theory of motivation, Women's Initiative Supporting Health (WISH), shows promise in engaging women into needed treatment. This proposed randomized control trial will examine the feasibility and acceptability of WISH in a community health setting to improve health of women recently released from incarceration. Recruitment sites include court, jail, transitional housing, and community service settings. Our prior work lays the foundation for us to collaborate with community partners and examine implementation of this project in a larger scale future study. The specific aims include engaging women in behavioral and medication treatment to prevent HIV infections and address SUD, mental health, and intimate partner violence. WISH is culturally-specific because it is delivered by a trained formerly incarcerated peer who both enhances patients' choice and feelings of competence to change behaviors and helps them navigate the complex medical system. In addition to the other health risks noted, stress and mental health problems which recently released women experience put them at risk of immune dysfunction that can lessen their ability to fight infection. We will also examine whether participants' immune markers in their blood are impacted by WISH. To understand how WISH works, we will also examine participants' Self-Determination Theory-based mediation measures regarding changes in health behavior, along with any behavior changes. Since both individual and structural barriers prevent recently released women from being healthy, WISH operates on both levels. Individually, WISH sessions are one-on- one between the woman and her peer community health worker. Structurally peers inform providers regarding women's treatment needs and readiness, and help women navigate linkage with needed services and overcome systemic barriers to care. Women in the control group will be randomized to enhanced treatment as usual with assistance linking to primary care but will receive HIV prevention information in lieu of the WISH intervention. If successful among recently released women, WISH has potential for success with women under community corrections with similar risk factors and is potentially cost-saving. Our proposal is responsive to new NIH HIV/AIDS research guidelines: we will examine feasibility and acceptability of WISH to help providers identify people at HIV risk, and promote entry and adherence to HIV prevention; while examining biological and behavioral mechanisms of changes in HIV risk, we will develop community and training infrastructures which will reduce disparities in HIV acquisition. Our structural and individual Self-Determination Theory-based intervention uniquely addresses HIV, serves recently released women, has trauma-specific practices, utilizes peer navigation, and examines immunologic biomarkers as potential mediators."
"9462795","Project 2: Microglia as Mediators of Dendritic Spine Loss and Plaque Formation in the AD Brain Project Summary/Abstract Dendritic spine loss is closely associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other disorders. Identifying the mechanisms and stimuli that lead to spine loss in disease is crucial to developing strategies to reverse or prevent these losses, hopefully leading to improvements in cognition. Concurrent with spine loss, chronic microglial-activation is found in the AD brain and in other disorders. As part of our investigations into inflammation in the pathogenesis of AD, we targeted the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), as this regulates the proliferation of microglia. We discovered that microglia are physiologically dependent upon CSF1R signaling and that administration of CSF1R antagonists results in the rapid and continued elimination of virtually all microglia from the CNS. We have used this approach to determine that microglia do play a highly significant role in regulating dendritic spine numbers in the adult brain elimination of microglia for 8 weeks results in a ~35% increase in spine densities in CA1 and layer V cortical neurons. Additionally, electrophysiology reveals robustly increased excitatory synaptic inputs to neurons, showing direct evidence of increased active synapses. As we have shown that microglia play a role in modulating spine and synapses in the adult brain, we now propose that this normal function goes awry in AD, leading to overpruning of synapses and resulting in reduced spine densities and subsequent cognitive decline. Our project proposes 4 linked aims that will utilize human tissue to explore the relationship between microglia and dendritic spine loss, as well as plaque formation, in AD. Firstly, we will conduct thorough correlations between microglial densities and morphologies with spine loss from post-mortem tissues in control, MCI and AD subjects. We will then test our hypothesis using tissue from high-pathology control subjects. We will utilize human fibroblasts from MCI subjects, with either a high number of AD microglial-risk SNPs or a low number, which are converted to pluripotent stem cells via iPS cell technology, and then differentiated into microglia. We will then explore how microglia derived from these MCI patients differ in their abilities to 1) prune dendritic spines and 2) phagocytose and clear A?, correlating these findings with the conversion into AD from our MCI subjects. Critical to our approach, we now have the technology to eliminate all endogenous microglia from the mouse CNS via administration of CSF1R inhibitors and then repopulate the mouse brain by infusing in human IPS- derived microglia. Using this method, we can explore the effects of these cells in an in vivo setting and thus determine the effects of these human-derived microglia on both dendritic spines and on clearance/formation of A? plaques. Through these experiments we will be able to fully study the relationship between human microglia and AD pathology/spine loss in a fashion that has not been previously possible. These results will potentially lead to the development of inhibitors that can eliminate microglia in the AD brain and hence prevent spine loss."
"9459744","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infants are exposed to commensal (non-pathogenic) bacteria that naturally colonize the gut, oral cavity, and other body surfaces exposed to the external environment. Post-natal colonization of the gut by commensal bacteria regulates the development of the immune system, having lifelong implications for health vs. disease. Of interest, recent genomic studies characterizing the diverse bacteria making up the normal gut flora, have identified distinct commensal bacteria which potently stimulate specific T-lymphocyte immune cell populations during growth & development. While extensive research has focused on the commensal gut flora immuno- regulatory effects in the context of protection against pathogenic bacteria and autoimmune diseases, the commensal flora impact on normal developmental processes is largely unknown. The study of osteoimmunology (*immune cell interactions with bone cells) has shown that specific T- lymphocyte immune cells in the bone marrow regulate bone modeling and remodeling. Despite knowledge that the commensal gut flora directs the development of T-lymphocyte mediated immunity in early post-natal development, there are no known published studies elucidating the commensal gut flora immuno-regulatory effects on pediatric skeletal development. Published findings from the investigator's postdoctoral research work, suggest that commensal flora interactions with the host immune system induce a low level inflammatory state which has catabolic effects in the developing skeleton. The proposed original research investigating the commensal gut flora's immuno-modulatory effects on marrow CD4+/CD8+ T-cell hematopoiesis and bone modeling in the developing GF vs. SPF mouse model is highly relevant in advancing the understanding of normal developmental processes regulating skeletal health. Three specific aims will optimize strong in vitro and in vivo strategies built upon the use of germ-free vs specific- pathogen-free mice to investigate the overall hypothesis that the commensal flora regulates effector CD4+/CD8+ t-cells in the bone environment, having catabolic effects on bone modeling during skeletal development. The first specific aim will investigate the influence of the normal microbiota on osteoblastogenesis; the second specific aim will determine if the osteoclastogenic potential is altered by the commensal flora; the third specific aim will elucidate mechanisms mediating the commensal flora's catabolic effects on skeletal development. This research defining the commensal flora immunomodulatory effects on skeletal development is highly relevant in advancing the understanding of osteoimmunological processes regulating the attainment of peak bone mass, having implications for osteoporosis and periodontitis related skeletal deterioration. Importantly, these studies will provide a strong career development & scientific experience supporting the candidate's transition to scientific independence."
"9458034","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE) is an autosomal dominant bone disorder caused by heterozygous mutations of EXT1 or EXT2, which jointly encode a glycosyltransferase essential for heparan sulfate biosynthesis. MHE is the most common genetic bone dysplasia and thought to affect several thousand Americans. During the current funding cycle, we elucidated a long- standing puzzle concerning the genetic mechanism of MHE. Specifically, we demonstrated that loss of heterozygosity modeled via stochastic conditional knockout results in the recapitulation of essentially all human MHE phenotypes. Based on this achievement and novel questions revealed by these studies, we will explore further this debilitating disease, with goals of understanding its complete pathogenic mechanism and identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. We propose the following aims. 1. Determine the origin of osteochondroma: While our studies elucidated the genetic mechanisms of osteochondromatogenesis, the cellular mechanisms by which a small number of Ext1 null cells develop into osteochondromas remains almost entirely elusive. One of the critical issues is whether osteochondromas are originated either from growth plate chondrocytes or from the perichondrium. We will perform perichondrium-specific Ext1 knockout and the analysis of perichondrial progenitor cells lacking Ext1 to address this issue. 2. Determine the affected signaling pathway that is critical for osteochondromatogenesis: Another critical issue is what is the defective signaling pathway directly responsible for osteochondromatogenesis. Based on strong preliminary evidence, we will focus on the BMP pathway and determine whether aberrant BMP signaling is the main molecular culprit underlying the disease. 3. Genome-wide analysis of osteochondroma transcriptome: We will perform a state-of-the-art bioinformatics study to determine transcriptomic changes that define osteochondroma. By applying the weighted gene coexpression network analysis on RNA microarray data sets, we will identify molecular signatures that distinguish osteochondroma from normal chondrocytes and potential genetic biomarkers to predict the future severity and recurrence of osteochondroma in MHE patients."
"9480852","ABSTRACT We propose a mechanistic study of the biological responses of adult human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to 3D substrate rigidity using hydrogel scaffolds of photocrosslink-controllable stiffness. Specifically, our focus is on the role of membrane cholesterol and caveolae subdomains, and focal adhesion signaling in these responses. The responses of MSCs to substrate rigidity, particularly in a 3D context, represent an important regulatory mechanism of their biological activities, of particular relevance to their application in tissue engineering and regeneration. We postulate here that these responses involve integrin-mediated focal adhesion signaling, and are potentially sensitive to cellular cholesterol homeostasis. We therefore propose to analyze the effects of the cholesterol/Caveolin-1 (Cav-1)/caveolae membrane system, which is known to regulate focal adhesion signaling, on MSC substrate rigidity responses, with special attention to differentiation. Information on the effects of this system on MSC behavior may be important in a wider context, if it is affected in vivo by cholesterol-modifying drugs, which are widely clinically prescribed and thus may influence outcomes of regenerative therapies.  We hypothesize that elevated cell membrane levels of cholesterol/Cav-1/caveolae decrease MSC sensitivity to substrate stiffness through increasing integrin endocytosis and decreasing focal adhesion signaling. To test our hypothesis, we propose three specific aims in which we will use cholesterol depletion, cholesterol supplementation, Cav-1 knockdown, and pharmacological inhibitors, to study the roles of MSC membrane cholesterol, Cav-1, caveolae, and focal adhesion signaling in MSC rigidity sensing in our 3D experimental platform. AIM 1: Test the effects of perturbations in cholesterol/Cav-1/caveolae homeostasis on MSC membrane properties and adhesive characteristics. This will verify that manipulation of cholesterol/Cav- 1/caveolae impacts aspects of the MSC cell membrane important to substrate sensing, including integrin expression, activation and internalization, and the strength of cell adhesion to defined substrates. AIM 2: Test the responses of MSCs with and without perturbations in cellular cholesterol/Cav-1/caveolae homeostasis to varied stiffness in a 3D context. This will determine how MSCs respond to varied substrate rigidity in 3D, in terms of their morphology, substrate adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and differentiation, and if manipulation of cholesterol/Cav-1/caveolae affects these responses. AIM 3: Test the activity of integrin- activated focal adhesion signaling pathways in MSCs within soft and stiff 3D substrates, and the regulatory effects of cholesterol/Cav-1/caveolae on focal adhesion signaling and downstream differentiation as influenced by soft and stiff 3D scaffolds. This will determine if focal adhesion signaling is involved in MSC substrate rigidity responses, and if such involvement is affected by cholesterol/Cav-1/caveolae."

"9537576","ABSTRACT (Project 5: Zhang, Boitano, Lantz)  Chronic exposure to arsenic-containing dusts from the Iron King Mine Superfund Site, and other hardrock (metal) mining sites in arid and semi-arid climate is of public health importance worldwide. Both cancer and non-malignant lung diseases are associated with chronic arsenic exposure. While arsenic is classified as a carcinogen following either ingestion or inhalation, little data exist concerning the modes of action for development of noncancerous lung diseases from exposure to arsenic containing dusts through inhalation. Noncancerous lung diseases that have been associated with arsenic ingestion include both obstructive (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis) and restrictive (fibrosis) lung disease. Preliminary data from Project 4 and others suggest that inhalation of arsenic associated with particulates may be an important exposure route for lung toxicity. Collectively, data indicate that arsenic exposure compromises the barrier integrity of the airway epithelium by inducing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). This project will examine a potential intervention to block arsenic toxicity. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that is activated by oxidative stress. Activation of the canonical Nrf2 pathway leads to expression of genes that can protect against increased oxidative stress. The Zhang team's studies (and others) indicate a protective role for Nrf2 against arsenic exposure. However, the molecular mechanisms of how Nrf2 protects airway epithelial cells, specifically, how activation of Nrf2 pathways can modulate EMT and airway epithelial barrier function, is not known. The hypothesis of Project 5 is that arsenic-containing dusts cause airway epithelial dysfunction through autophagy blockage/prolonged Nrf2 activation (non-canonical); however, intermittent induction of Nrf2 (canonical) by dietary supplementation during exposure can maintain airway epithelial barrier integrity, and thus, reduce arsenic-induced lung disease. These differential outcomes are indicative of a ?dark side? of Nrf2 that may contribute to arsenic toxicity. We will examine this hypothesis in the following three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the protective role of Nrf2 in maintaining airway epithelial barrier integrity in response to dust particles with/without arsenic in vitro. We will then, in Aim 2, determine the molecular mechanisms of Nrf2 induction (canonical vs non-canonical) by dust particles with/without arsenic in vitro. Finally, in Aim 3, we will examine the efficacy of prophylactic canonical Nrf2 activation by dietary supplementation in maintaining airway epithelial barrier integrity and ameliorating lung damage in mice exposed to inhaled dust particles with/without arsenic. Impact: Dietary Nrf2 activation may counteract arsenic-mediated inhalation toxicity to lung epithelium, providing an intervention for populations at high risk of arsenic exposure. A detailed understanding of the mechanism of Nrf2 activation by arsenic dusts and its effects on airway epithelial cells will prove extremely valuable in the generation of preventive and therapeutic strategies for the populations at risk of exposure to arsenic, and potentially, other metal(oids)."
"9458092","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have previously shown that TGF? signaling is a key regulator of the tendon cell fate: TGF? signaling is a potent inducer of tendon markers and disruption of TGF? signaling in limb bud mesenchyme resulted in failure of tendon development. This proposal is based on observations regarding the role of TGF? signaling in later stages of tendon development. We find that disrupting the type 2 TGF? receptor (T?R2) in tenocytes using the ScxCre tendon deletor resulted in tendon degeneration in early postnatal stages. Interestingly, embryonic development of the tendons was not affected and the tendons developed a robust and organized collagen matrix, but in early stages of postnatal development the movement of T?R2;ScxCre pups was perturbed and their tendons showed gradual loss of tendon markers followed by degenerative processes. Moreover, we find that tenocyte dedifferentiation was not due to an intrinsic loss of TGF? signaling, since loss of the T?R2 in isolated patches of tenocytes did not have a similar effect. We therefore hypothesize that loss of TGF? signaling results in disruptions to cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions in tendons leading o tenocyte dedifferentiation and tendon degeneration. The proposed project follows these observations in three major directions, the first aim is to determine if there is a developmental time window in which disruption of TGF? signaling will lead to tendon degeneration and to develop more limited model of the phenotype that will enable following the full scope of the degenerative process and developing it as a system for analysis of tendinopathy. In the second aim we will investigate the cellular and molecular changes in the mutant tendons to identify the key features essential for maintenance of the tendon cell fate. Finally, in the third aim we analyze the role of activin signaling in this process based on preliminary results that show synergistic interactions between TGF? and activin signaling."
"9543674","PROJECT SUMMARY Carcinogenesis involves the dysregulation, both mutational and transcriptional, of the complex interactions of hundreds of genes. Currently no platform allows for the predictable transcriptional modulation of this many genes simultaneously. Gene transcription is modulated by a number of mechanisms including the well-studied histone modification and genome compartmentalization mechanisms as well as the still insufficiently understood role of the complex physical nanoenvironment within chromatin. Since transcriptional molecular interactions are chemical reactions, they depend on the local physical environment within the chromatin which, in turn, depends on the physical pattern of chromatin folding at supra-nucleosomal length scales. The overarching goal of this project is to develop new tools to modulate the chromatin nanoenvironment for whole- scale transcriptional engineering for cancer prevention and therapeutics. Transcriptional diversity plays a major role in carcinogenesis by allowing cancer cells to explore their genomic space and has been shown to foster the emergence of resistance to chemotherapy in cancer cells. The project will leverage the methods of bioengineering to develop new tools to physico-chemically regulate chromatin structure toward a normalized, constrained, and less-adaptive state. The project will identify physico-chemical mechanisms that can be targeted to reduce transcriptional heterogeneity and validate the efficacy of the chromatin folding-normalization in patient- derived xenograft (PDX) tumor models of colon cancer as an adjuvant therapy for alleviating chemoresistance through the reduction of the transcriptional heterogeneity of tumors."
"9465441","Abstract: Since their clinical introduction over 30 years ago, cochlear implants (CIs) have had a remarkable impact on patients experiencing moderate-to-profound hearing loss. Recent advances in technology have driven the development of ?hearing preservation? implants and procedures designed to preserve the residual acoustic hearing of patients while treating the damaged areas of the ear with an electrically stimulated CI. Despite these advances, over half of patients undergoing this procedure will eventually lose residual hearing months to years after surgery likely due to cochlear trauma sustained during the surgery. Additionally, because current techniques do not allow the electrode to be inserted farther into the cochlea to reach now dysfunctional regions, patients either require additional surgery or live with suboptimal hearing once again. iotaMotion is developing an implantable robotic-assisted positioning system to enable precise control of intracochlear electrodes both intra- and post-operatively to reduce the effects of post-surgical hearing loss. The anticipated impact of this technology will be to improve the long-term outcomes of patients undergoing ?hearing preservation? cochlear implantation as well as increase the candidacy range for this procedure. The overall goal of this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project is to further develop and ultimately commercialize iotaMotion's proprietary technology. During ?Phase I-equivalent SBIR? studies, iotaMotion developed and characterized an initial prototype to establish proof of concept and feasibility in cadaveric models. Following that success, Phase II will continue to develop the technology toward commercialization with the following specific aims: 1) Verify device compatibility and ?open? platform with commercially available cochlear implants . Using 3 clinically available electrodes, we will establish the procedure, instructions, and ease of use for integrating each electrode within the device, then determine the maximum stall force that can occur with each device/electrode combination. 2) Establish that the iotaMotion pilot-line system meets functional, quality, safety, and biocompatibility requirements in a GLP environment. Using a combination of international standards and in-house experiments, we will demonstrate that the device can be sterilized, is biocompatible, and can remain functional in the body for up to 6 months. Quality standards will be implemented to ensure valid data are collected for eventual regulatory submission. 3) Evaluate the efficacy of the iotaMotion robotic-assisted surgical system in a long-term large-animal model. Phase II will conclude with an evaluation of the device efficacy in an established sheep model over 3 months. Completing these aims will set the stage for our system development and production in a GMP environment with private-sector partnering and execution of a prospective clinical trial designed to establish safety and efficacy in humans. The phase II project enables iotaMotion to achieve significant commercialization milestones, driving the company forward toward improving the hearing and quality of life for millions worldwide."
"9606553","ABSTRACT Multiphoton microscopy is one of the preferred techniques for high-resolution functional brain imaging because of its remarkable depth penetration in thick tissue. In standard configurations, such imaging involves scanning a femtosecond laser focus in 3D throughout a sample. The laser power is fixed during the scan and image information is contained in the time dependence of the detected fluorescence signal. Several problems can occur with this technique. First, in common cases where the sample contains extreme variations in brightness, for example between large somas and much finer dendritic processes, it is often impossible to capture the full range of signals without either saturating the detector when scanning over bright regions, or losing signal when scanning over dim regions. Second, when imaging time-varying signals from functional reporters such as GCaMP, large brightness variations occur that cannot be predicted in advance, forcing the user to use a low illumination to minimize the possibility of detector saturation, thus potentially compromising SNR. Third, when performing volumetric scans through an extended range of depths, a single laser power becomes either too weak at large depths or too strong at shallow depths.  We propose a simple solution to solve all these problems. The solution involves actively regulating the laser power pixel-by-pixel using feedback electronics. We have demonstrated that our technique can improve the dynamic range of two-photon microscopes by several orders of magnitude for moderately fast pixel times of 20?s, achieving an unprecedentedly high dynamic range (HDR) of 1011:1. Our goals for this project are the: 1) Development of ultrafast feedback electronics for video-rate HDR imaging. 2) Development of switched multiplexing technique for large-scale multi-region HDR imaging. 3) Application of multiphoton HDR imaging to anatomical and functional mouse brain imaging. Our goal is to enable comprehensive large-scale multiphoton imaging with unprecedented dynamic range in a simple manner that can be readily implementable by many labs at reasonable cost and with minimal hardware modifications."
"9551522","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adaptive plasticity is a phrase used to explain how cancer cells gain selective growth and survival capabilities through phenotypic changes in response to their environment. Adaptive plasticity is exemplified by epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) a process, which enables cancer cells to become migratory and invasive as well as having an increase in survival properties. This process can be reversed to a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), which is believed to favor tumor engraftment and growth of cancer cells at metastatic sites. EMT in cancer cells is linked with isoform switching of the transmembrane protein CD44 from expressing the CD44 variant isoform (CD44v) to expressing CD44 standard form (CD44s). In this context we found that treatment of BxPC3 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell line with gemcitabine induces EMT and a high level of expression of CD44s with a decrease in expression of CD44v isoforms. This suggests that an adverse effect of chemotherapy may drive EMT, enhancing invasiveness and rendering tumor cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Moreover, we were able to use flow cytometry to select out from a PDAC cell lines (CFPAC-1 and AsPC1) a subpopulation of cells expressing high levels of CD44s. Knockdown of CD44s, in these cells, caused them to undergo MET, to be less invasive and to become more responsive to chemotherapy. These studies suggest that chemotherapy or other environmental stresses may induce a CD44s phenotype that promotes survival and is more invasive; however optimal tumor regrowth following chemotherapy or growth after engraftment of micrometastases may require re-switching to a CD44v phenotype and down regulation of CD44s expression. We hypothesize that CD44s and its variant isoforms are key regulators of adaptive plasticity in pancreatic cancer cells. We further hypothesize that understanding the molecular basis for adaptive plasticity will provide new strategies for improving therapy. These studies represent new data from our laboratory and build on 20 years of research solely focused on the biology and treatment of pancreatic cancer.  To address these hypotheses we propose the following three objectives. Objective 1. Determine the functional relevance of CD44s and CD44v in PDAC. This objective will be addressed using isogenic matched cell line models in which expression of CD44s and CD44v isoforms are regulated. The effects on modulating expression of CD44v and CD44s will be assessed for phenotype, invasiveness, response to chemotherapy, tumor engraftment and growth. Objective 2. Determine the mechanism(s) that regulates CD44 isoform switching and CD44 expression. This objective will determine the potential role of EMT related transcriptional repressors Snail and Zeb1 in suppressing ESRP1 that is required for expression of CD44v isoforms and further identify the mechanisms that lead to the increased transcription of CD44s. Objective 3. Determine whether anti-CD44 antibody prevents CD44 isotype switching or expression level and whether this improves response to chemotherapy and reduces metastasis. These studies will provide important new insights related to adaptive plasticity and determine whether this knowledge can be used to counter act adverse effects of chemotherapy induced phenotypic switching. Inhibiting or reversing the switch towards an EMT phenotype may prove to be an important strategy for increasing the response to chemotherapy and patient survival."
"9472412","Research focused on child and adolescent health lags behind that conducted with adults, due in part to the difficulty of recruiting investigators into the field. The goal of this Multidisciplinary Training Program in Child and Adolescent Health is to address the need for well-trained pediatric researchers by attracting talented trainees, equipping them with the tools to succeed and retaining their commitment to child health research. We believe Northwestern University (NU) and the NU Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NUCATS) are uniquely poised to innovatively address these challenges. We propose two approaches, a post-doctoral training program for clinical and basic scientists and a Summer Immersion Program (SIP) to attract underrepresented minorities to child and adolescent health research careers. In the postdoctoral program, we will apply our established expertise in recruiting and training young scientists and clinicians in translational science focused on child health. Each year, two pediatricians and two engineers (or similar PhD scientists) will be selected for a two-year training program, with a total of eight trainees in the program at one time. A rigorous selection process will examine the likelihood that the proposed training will lead to a career in which scientific approaches and clinical insight will be combined to advance child and adolescent health. The program plan is innovative and includes robust mentoring teams for each trainee. Primary mentors will be supported, as appropriate, by additional mentors with expertise in complementary scientific approaches; in Research Design, Analysis and Methods (RAMP); and in Community Stakeholder involvement. The trainees will undergo a unique orientation and individual development planning process to help them effectively utilize the breadth of resources and opportunities available to them. Core training elements will include a course in fundamentals of child-health research and a peer-mentoring program that has been highly successful at NU. Team science and mentoring workshops will be provided by national experts, to support mentors and mentees in navigating their roles on the mentoring team. Specific programming will address retention of women in child and adolescent health research. In the second approach, the SIP program will encourage underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in child health research. Each year, four highly-qualified Masters' students at Chicago State University will be selected to spend 10 weeks with TL1 mentors, complemented by ongoing interaction with SIP leadership before, during and after the program. This TL1 program is based on our successful track record at NU of training engineers and clinician-scientists in translational research, and benefits from unique strengths at NU that include top-tier clinical resources in Lurie Children's Hospital and Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, strong and accelerating research programs at NU's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and Feinberg School of Medicine, and NUCATS."
"9458682","ADMINISTRATIVE CORE - CORE A: ABSTRACT The BIOCARD study is a longitudinal, observational study of 349 individuals who were cognitively normal and primarily middle aged (mean age=57.1) at enrollment. Our overall objectives are to further advance the study of preclinical AD by: (1) clarifying the pattern and rate of changes in AD biomarkers (including CSF, MRI, amyloid imaging and blood) and cognition that occur during the earliest phases of AD, (2) maximizing our data by working collaboratively with several research groups who have comparable data, and (3) providing a publicly accessible database, to include biological specimens, for researchers in the field. To accomplish these goals we established 7 Cores. The Administrative Core (Core A) is essential for the overall functioning and coordination of the project. The specific aims include: (1) oversight and integration of the Cores in the project, (2) facilitation of collaborative research with investigators outside of Johns Hopkins University (JHU), (3) assurance of sound fiscal management, (4) assurance that all aspects of the project comply with local and federal regulations, (5) coordinating external review of the project through meetings of the Scientific Advisory Board and the Resource Allocation Committee, and (6) communicating with the staff of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) consistent with the guidelines of the FOA."
"9472320","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant supports the enhancement of a recently launched two semester Interdisciplinary Medical Product Development (IMPD) senior design capstone course sequence in the Department of Bioengineering at UIC in two significant ways: (1) development of a Biomedical Clinical Immersion course to serve as a gateway to IMPD, and (2) acquisition of a Fused Deposition Modeling rapid prototype machine. Two complementary directions of proposed curricular innovation will be integrated: a truly interdisciplinary teachingof early product development that is based on an understanding and appreciation of user needs, and an iterative approach to advanced prototyping and testing of medical devices to meet regulations and standards. IMPD is modeled on the nationally recognized Interdisciplinary Product Development (IPD) program developed at UIC a decade ago starting with mechanical and industrial engineering. In IMPD, design teams are comprised of seniors in Bioengineering, MFA Industrial Design students, and MBA students, and the course is co-taught by faculty from all three colleges (Engineering, Architecture and Design, and Business). IMPD benefits from frequent feedback from clinician mentors assigned to each team that are selected based upon the project topic. In addition, the project is sponsored by an industry partner, which provides industry-perspective mentorship to each team. The IMPD program exposes students to the entire medical product development cycle, beginning in the earliest stages of needs assessment. The IMPD course does provide for clinical observation and engaging clinical input from the earliest stages; but, a Biomedical Clinical Immersion course will provide the depth to holistically understand the clinical environment, including process flow, workarounds, and inefficiencies. Proof of concept testing lies at the opposite end of the product development cycle, and necessarily relies upon a physical prototype. The process of iterative prototyping permits refinement of the concept such that it is appropriate in look, feel and function. Acquisition of a Fused Deposition Modeling rapid prototype machine will permit students to quickly actualize and respond to their CAD-based concept designs, and allow them to experience the entirety of the product development cycle in as real world scenario as possible."
"9481725","The overall goal of this proposed KL2 Program is to facilitate the recruitment, training, mentoring and retention of clinical and translational researchers from a broad range of health professions and diverse backgrounds. The program is designed to address some of the unmet needs and challenges for strengthening the clinical investigator pipeline that were outlined by the NIH Physician-Scientist Workforce working group. Its curricular activities were informed by a survey of the needs of young scientists across the Mount Sinai Health System. The proposed program: 1) takes a comprehensive approach to targeting and selecting KL2 candidates with special emphasis on underrepresented minorities and partnership with department chairs to help ensure retention; 2) provides multidisciplinary mentorship and individual coaching to identify strengths and weaknesses of scholars to inform individual development plans; 3) expands the training experiences outside of the Mount Sinai campus, including industry, community organizations and other CTSA hubs; 4) formalizes the training of research mentors at Mount Sinai and undertakes a concerted effort to expand the ranks of underrepresented minority mentor-role models; 5) emphasizes team sciences through courses that involve team-based technology product development and seminars on team building with management specialists; 6) facilitates transition to individual investigator status through grant writing workshops; and 7) includes the infrastructure for long-term tracking of our trainees to assess the outcomes of our training innovations and our contribution to the research workforce. The proposed KL2 program builds on the rich educational infrastructure and expertise of Mount Sinai and its new educational partner, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which provides, among other things, educational and research collaboration opportunities in engineering and computer science. The proposed program also enriches the experience of scholars through its integration with other components of this CTSA, including Research Expertise and Methods, Research Implementation and Participation and Translational Science Base. Mount Sinai is committed to evolving our already successful KL2 program to optimize the training of translational researchers and believe that we have an important role to play in providing the laboratory for the implementation and assessment of research training innovations that have the potential to more generally shape the future of scientific training and investigation."
"9551506","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         GRB7 is amplified and over-expressed in breast cancer with chromosome 17q11-12 amplification. GRB7 can interact with multiple signaling molecules and is implicated in breast cancer biology. GRB7 can facilitate HER-2 mediated signaling and tumor formation. Studies, including that of ours, have shown GRB7 protein overexpression, rather than that of HER-2, is an adverse prognostic factor in breast cancer. Moreover, GRB7 protein is the only adverse prognostic marker, from among 374 studied, in triple negative breast cancer.  We hypothesize that GRB7 directed signaling is functionally important in breast cancer with chromosome 17q11-12 amplification. Targeting GRB7 signaling therefore represents an important and novel therapeutic strategy for HER-2 positive and triple negative breast cancers that are otherwise clinically aggressive.  The objectives are: (1) to investigate the dependency of breast cancer cells on GRB7 signaling by determining if inhibition of GRB7 signaling functions leads to suppression of breast cancer cell growth; (2) to develop isogenic pairs of breast cancer cell lines with shRNA mediated GRB7 knockdown and perform Induced Essentiality screening with small molecule inhibitor libraries; (3) to perform screening with a siRNA library that covers the whole actionable kinome with cell spot microarrays and a novel reverse transfection technology to identify and validate targets whose knock down displays GRB7-dependent effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and/or migration/invasion; and (4) to investigate the functional involvement of candidate cell cycle kinase(s) in GRB7 signaling and their roles as therapeutic targets.  Our approaches are the following: GRB7 knock down has been achieved by transient siRNA transfection in multiple breast cancer cell lines with chromosome 17q11-12 amplification. GRB7 protein depletion decreases cell proliferation in cell lines irrespective of their sensitivityto currently available HER-2 targeted therapies. Stable GRB7 knock down has been achieved by shRNA expression in breast cancer cell lines and its effect on cell growth in culture and in orthotopic mouse xenograft models will be assessed. Stable GRB7 knock down creates a 'sensitized' cellular context to screen for therapeutic targets and molecules whose signaling functions depend on GRB7 expression. We will screen for signaling molecules whose inhibition is sensitized by GRB7 over-expression- i.e. induced essentiality. In addition, signaling molecules whose inhibition displays differential sensitivity according to their GRB7 status will unravel the functional complexities of GRB7 signaling in breast cancer. The novel cell spot microarray coupled with siRNA reverse transfection will be used to screen actionable targets of the whole human kinome. We are able to expand this cell based functional genetic screen to include more siRNA constructs, allow combinatorial siRNA analyses, and obtain multi-parametric phenotypic readouts and comparative analysis of multiple cell types simultaneously. We will also perform screening of small molecule inhibitor libraries that comprise of compounds that are well characterized and undergoing early clinical development. With screening of small molecule inhibitor and siRNA libraries made up by actionable targets, we are looking for candidates whose inhibition produces distinct phenotypes that depend on the GRB7 expression status. Screen positives will be validated with independent functional assays and in additional cell lines and animal models. Since screen positives are molecules with actionable features or compounds already undergoing early phase clinical development, they can be readily moved forwards in drug development expeditiously. Thorough investigation of these GRB7 dependent signaling molecules and therapeutic targets will produce new therapies and reveal why GRB7 expression predicts adverse prognosis. High throughout screening of actionable siRNA and small molecule inhibitor libraries represents a novel paradigm to elucidate the function of an adaptor molecule and, more importantly, to effectively produce clinically useful, non-toxic therapeutics specifically directed against an oncogenic signaling molecule that is otherwise difficult to target."
"9414977","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research background: Over the past four years, Dr. Gros has worked as a Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) Staff Psychologist, providing evidence-based psychotherapies to Veterans with depressive and anxiety disorders and completing related research projects to better understand and improve clinical outcomes in Veterans with these disorders. To date, Dr. Gros has authored 43 peer-reviewed publications and 32 conference presentations at meetings of national and international societies. Dr. Gros has also served as Co- Investigator on two DVA Merit Awards. Immediate and Long-Term Career Goals: Dr. Gros' long-term career goals involve improving the effectiveness, efficiency, dissemination, and implementation of evidence-based psychotherapy for Veterans with depressive and anxiety disorders. Consistent with these long-term goals, Dr. Gros' DVA Career Development Award (CDA) proposes to evaluate a single unified transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in Veterans with depressive/anxiety disorders to improve clinical outcomes and reduce comorbidity as compared to an evidence-based psychotherapy control condition of behavioral activation treatment (BAT). Primary Aims in Career and Mentorship Plan: In order to accomplish these goals, Dr. Gros' CDA also will provide vital trainings in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including advanced methodology, implementation, statistical evaluation, and grantsmanship. Specialized coursework, scheduled time with mentors, and hands-on trainings will be used to enhance Dr. Gros' background in each of these areas. Relevance of Research Plan: CBT is robustly effective in treating Veterans with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, CBT is underutilized due in large part to the complexity and number of protocols across disorders, as well as extensive training needed to apply them. These limitations have reduced Veterans' access to CBT, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes and quality of life. To address these concerns, world renowned experts in the CBT field have been calling for a new transdiagnostic approach to treatment in order to improve access to care by distilling the existing disorder-specific CBT protocols for emotional problems into an unified CBT protocol for the great majority of depressive/anxiety disorder presentations. Primary Aims in Research Plan: The proposed CDA research aims to: 1) compare the efficacy of transdiagnostic CBT on reducing mental health symptoms and improving quality of life to the BAT control condition, and 2) compare the feasibility and acceptability of the transdiagnostic CBT to the BAT control condition. Participant population: The participants of the proposed study will include 96 DVA patients with depressive/anxiety disorders. General inclusion criteria includes: 1) a principal diagnosis of a depressive/anxiety disorder; and 2) a willingness and competence to provide informed consent for research participation. Procedures to be used: A RCT of the transdiagnostic CBT and BAT control condition will be completed. Participation in the RCT will involve completion of: 1) consent documentation, 2) intake assessment, 3) random assignment to treatment condition, 4) weekly 50 minute appointments of individual psychotherapy for 12-16 weeks, and 5) self-report assessments of symptomatology and quality life at intake, one week post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: If successful, this proposed project will lead to reduced symptomatology, comorbidity, and improved quality of life and recovery in DVA patients with depressive/anxiety disorders by eventually improving access to and availability of evidence-based CBT through this new transdiagnostic CBT protocol."
"9429024","Abstract Despite the crucial importance of the inter-follicular epidermis (IFE) for the essential body barrier function, molecular characterization of the stem cells (SCs) within the basal layer has not been achieved. This impairs our ability to study the mechanisms that specifically control IFE SCs for proper homeostasis and wound healing and to understand how these mechanisms may be affected in skin disease and aging. The IFE SCs have been traditionally identified in vivo as DNA label retaining cells (LRCs) while transit amplifying (TA) or progenitor cells were considered non-LRCs. However, LRC and non-LRC markers to unambiguously test this model in vivo had been lacking. Using our H2B-GFP pulse-chase transgenic mouse system, we label IFE LRCs and non-LRCs, define mRNA expression profiles, and find that these cells are molecularly distinct. In our first set of preliminary data, we demonstrate that, contrary to the expectation that SC are frequently dividing cells, both of our IFE cellular subsets of LRCs (marked by Dlx1CreER) and of non-LRCs (marked by Slc1a3CreER) act as two independent SCs in long-term lineage tracing. Collectively, our data support a model in which the IFE is a heterogeneous tissue, being composed of molecularly distinct domains or territories, which are spatially patterned relative to each other and to skin landmarks. These territories are enriched in LRCs and non-LRCs, regenerate at different rates, and contain distinct SCs and differentiated cells that can be defined as molecularly discrete IFE cellular subsets. We provide LRC and non-LRC-enriched markers and genetic labeling tools that define novel IFE cellular subsets, which will enable us to rigorously examine the newly uncovered IFE heterogeneity. The specific objectives are to: (i) examine the organization of IFE territories throughout life, and determine relative SC potential of newly uncovered IFE cellular subsets; (ii) validate and refine markers of IFE heterogeneity from our newly uncovered undifferentiated and differentiated IFE cellular subsets; and (iii) unravel mechanism of IFE heterogeneity by focusing on two transcription factors we identified in our LRC versus non-LRC IFE subsets. Collectively, our data will constitute a key for understanding previously un-recognized cellular and molecular heterogeneity within the IFE and provide a new entry point into SC regulation in this essential, yet poorly understood skin compartment."
"9665074","Summary Intracellular protozoal diseases, including visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and malaria, are predominant causes of morbidity and mortality of children throughout tropical regions. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the roles of humoral responses during intracellular protozoan parasite infection and why effective long-lived humoral memory does not typically develop after infection with these pathogens. The interaction of nave B cells with T follicular helper cells (TFH) within the spleen, informed by the cytokine environment, is a crucial signaling exchange that establishes populations of effector and memory B cells. The specific subsets and effects of regulatory B cells on splenic structure and TFH function is unknown. Using our unique, naturally- occurring, canine model of VL that closely mimics human VL, we provide new evidence that pathological alterations in splenic follicular structure determine subsequent B and T cell dysfunction following Leishmania spp. infection. Using this model we identified mechanisms of Leishmania infection-induced IgDhi regulatory B cells; inhibiting macrophage reactive oxygen species production promoting T cell exhaustion via robust regulatory IL-10 production and expression of the checkpoint inhibitory receptor PD-L1, respectively. Our new data reveal novel mechanisms by which Leishmania parasites subvert host immunity and support our objective to; a) identify how specific B reg cell subsets inhibit production of long-lived humoral immunity and promote T cell exhaustion during progressive VL, b) understand why humoral immune memory is slow to develop in response to this disease, and c) identify mechanisms and pathways that can be therapeutically targeted to improve humoral immunity against intracellular protozoan parasites, including Leishmania. We will use the power of our natural canine VL model to establish the timing and cellular mechanisms of how regulatory B cells contribute to alter splenic structure and TFH function. We address these goals and test our hypothesis with experiments proposed in the following specific aims: 1) Determine the status of Leishmania-specific memory B cell subsets during controlled or progressive natural VL and if these cells prevent clinical VL, 2) Identify where within the spleen B regulatory cell interactions disrupt germinal cell function and T cell effector states in secondary lymphoid organs over time during natural VL, 3) Determine how PD-1 based T cell inhibitory mechanisms interact with regulatory B cells during infection to alter memory and overall immunity and clinical status. Completion of this proposed work will identify new translational opportunities to improve clinical outcomes of progressive VL through alteration of chronic inflammation, retention of functional intrafollicular germinal centers and recovery of memory B cells."
"9457443","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The midget and parasol ganglion cells are the most abundant output neurons in the primate retina, and are fundamental for our perception of color, form and motion. Midget (sustained) ganglion cells respond optimally to slow changes in light intensity, whereas parasol (transient) ganglion cells can detect more rapid fluctuations, a feature that enhances sensitivity to motion. The objective of this study is to determine how the various types of bipolar cells, the second- order neurons, process cone signals to generate these distinct temporal response properties. Since few functional recordings have been made from primate cone bipolar cells, the mechanisms that mediate temporal tuning remain unclear. Moreover, our preliminary data indicate that previously proposed models for temporal tuning, from work in lower-order mammals, may not directly apply to primates. In preliminary studies, we have found that, unlike other mammals, all macaque OFF cone bipolar cells receive input primarily through kainate- type glutamate receptors. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that heterogeneity in kainate receptor subunit composition, and kainate receptor auxiliary proteins, shapes the temporal response properties of OFF bipolar cells. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that selective expression of voltage-gated channels tunes specific OFF cone bipolar cell types to higher temporal frequencies. In Aim 3, we will determine whether a newly identified OFF bipolar cell type makes input to OFF parasol cells, and will test whether there are eccentricity-dependent changes in OFF midget ganglion cell circuitry. We will address these aims using a combination of immunohistochemistry, confocal and super-resolution microscopy, and patch-clamp electrophysiology. These studies will provide new insights into the functional mechanisms of temporal processing in the primate retina, and should also reveal new details regarding the circuitry of midget and parasol ganglion cells. Thus, this proposal addresses two explicit needs identified by the National Eye Institute which are; 1) to understand the structure, function and circuitry of retinal neurons and 2) to decode the electrical patterns used by retina neurons to transmit visual information. The macaque is an ideal model system for the human retina, and thus the results of this study will be invaluable for developing methods to restore or treat vision loss from retinal disease, and for interpreting tests of visual function."
"9470907","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ARDS is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. There are no specific therapies for ARDS other than protective mechanical ventilation and conservative fluid management and mortality remains high at 30-50%. Thus, there is a critical need for specific therapies that target fundamental mechanisms of ARDS. Increased lung epithelial permeability is a pathophysiologic hallmark of ARDS and is manifest clinically by pulmonary edema, impaired gas exchange and acute respiratory failure. We have identified cell free hemoglobin as a novel mediator of increased epithelial permeability in ARDS. Our preliminary data show that airspace levels of cell-free hemoglobin are high in ARDS and are associated with increased lung permeability and poor clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it is the Ferryl oxidized form of hemoglobin that is elevated in the airspaces in ARDS. In a clinical trial in severe sepsis, the leading cause of ARDS, treatment with an inhibitor of Ferryl hemoglobin, acetaminophen, decreased lipid peroxidation and attenuated acute kidney injury. In cultured lung epithelial cells, hemoglobin treatment induces epithelial barrier permeability through cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation. Furthermore, intratracheal administration of cell-free hemoglobin to the lungs of mice leads to generation of oxidized Ferryl hemoglobin and increased lung alveolar capillary barrier permeability. These findings support the overall hypothesis for the proposed studies, that formation of Ferryl-Hgb in the airspace in ARDS causes alveolar epithelial cell oxidative stress and increased epithelial permeability, contributing to the pathophysiology of ARDS. To test this hypothesis I have assembled a cross-disciplinary team of co-Investigators and consultants with expertise in clinical ARDS (Ware), Hgb redox chemistry (Roberts), primary alveolar epithelial cell isolation and culture (Guttentag), mitochondrial oxidative stress (Dikalov), human models of ARDS (Matthay) and advanced in vivo imaging techniques (West) whose expertise complements my own in cellular models of epithelial permeability and animal models of ARDS. We will utilize clinical samples of pulmonary edema fluid already collected from patients with ARDS and hydrostatic pulmonary edema along with mouse and epithelial cell culture studies to show that levels of Ferryl hemoglobin in the airspace are increased in human ARDS and cause increased lung epithelial permeability in mice and cultured epithelial cells (Aim 1). We will define the cellular and molecular mechanism of hemoglobin induced increases in epithelial permeability and cellular and mitochondrial oxidative stress in the epithelium (Aim 2). Finally we will test a therapy targeted at Ferryl hemoglobin (acetaminophen) in cell culture, in a clinically relevant model of ventilator induced lung injury in mice and in an isolated perfused human lung model (Aim 3). This proposal is highly innovative and addresses a clinically significant problem. Results from these studies will greatly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of lung epithelial permeability in acute lung injury and will pave the way for future novel targeted therapeutics in ARDS."
"9460503","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding of face recognition: why are there multiple neuronal codes for faces in the brain, and how they are transformed through a network of interconnected face-processing areas to support face recognition? Continued existence of this gap constitutes an important problem because of the social importance of faces and because, until it is filled, the neural mechanisms for object recognition remain largely incomprehensible. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to gain a mechanistic understanding of face-recognition in a highly evolved face-processing system similar to that of humans. The overall objective of this particular application is to identiy the rules and mechanisms of informational neuronal transformations between the cortical nodes of the face-processing network. The proposed work will test the central hypothesis that this network is organized as an information-processing hierarchy serving robust face-recognition, in which each processing level performs a face-specific transformation. It takes advantage of the functional organization of the model system that consists of spatially distinct, but interconnected nodes with unique functional specializations - and the fact that these nodes are readily identifiable with brain imaging due to their selectivity for a known visual object category, faces. The rationale of this proposal is that, after completion of this research, we will understand core operations of high-level object recognition at a computational, representational, and mechanistic level. Guided by strong preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) What visual features do face cells use to represent complex facial information? 2) How do face areas interact to generate high-dimensional facial codes? 3) What is the causal role of face areas for facial coding and face detection? Under the first aim, we will combine single unit electrophysiological recordings in three brain-imaging identified face areas with parametric visual stimulation to reveal the computational mechanisms single cells use to code facial information. Under the second aim, joint electrophysiological recordings from multiple areas will be analyzed to reveal how inter-areal interactions generate face-representations that differ across areas and change over time. Under aim 3, targeted inactivation will be used to reveal the causal role different face processing areas play for informational transformations and for face detection. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to directly show how an information processing network is organized to transform visual representations of a high-level object category and utilizes them for visual behavior. In doing so it will lift our understanding of visual object recognition to a new level. The research proposed is conceptually and methodologically innovative because it in order to take a systems perspective to the problem of object recognition, tracing transformations of information through a multi-node network and integrating, through a novel combination of methodologies, analyses of single cell mechanisms and population codes with causal interrogation of network function."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGAs) are potent antibiotics which have long been used as potent broad spectrum antibiotics, with targets including gram negative and gram?negative pathogens, and complex infectious diseases such as hospitalized CAPD and exacerbated CF. Significant limitations of the AGAs, however, are AGA?induced permanent hearing loss (ototoxicity), which is reported to affect up to 20% of the patient population, nephrotoxicity, and resistance due to AGA and target modifying mechanisms. Based on extensive preliminary results two series of compounds, paromomycin and apramycin derivatives, will be synthesized and optimized for their ability to inhibit gram positive and gram negative wild type and multidrug resistant bacteria, and to do so with a much reduced toxicity profile. To achieve these ends all synthetic compounds will screened for their ability to inhibit bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes, indicative of antibacterial activity and toxcity respectively, and for their activity against engineered bacterial strains carrying specific resistance determinants. The results of these assays will be used in a feedback loop to inform the design and synthesis of the next iteration of compounds. A select set of optimized compounds will be screened for ototoxicity in the mouse cochlear explant model and then in the guinea pig model of ototoxicity. The guinea model will also be used to evaluate nephrotoxicity and systemic toxicity. Antibacterial efficacy of the optimized compounds will be determined in mice. At the end of the study, the goal is to have a small validated set of advanced compounds that display broad and potent antibiotic activity against wild type and multidrug resistant gram positive and gram negative bacteria, with much reduced toxicity, suitable for further development."
"9567813","Many Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) veterans experience chronic pain, which is worsened by co-morbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Significantly, there is an unmet clinical need to provide effective treatments for chronic pain. One hurdle for the development of new therapies is a lack of understanding which neurotransmitters and brain circuits are responsible for the persistence of chronic pain. Thus, this career development application will provide the necessary training to develop an independent VA scientist capable of researching novel brain circuitry responsible for the development of stress-induced chronic pain.  OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to identify the brain circuitry responsible for persistent stress- induced pain and comorbid behaviors using targeted brain manipulations, including optogenetic techniques. The overarching hypothesis is that stress induces imbalanced signaling within the limbic brain circuitry to produce persistent pain hypersensitivity.  RESEARCH PLAN: This project will utilize two interrelated, independent specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that stress-induced increases corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex leads to persistent visceral and somatic pain-like behaviors. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that an imbalance in signaling between limbic brain regions, regulated by corticotropin-releasing factor and glutamatergic receptors, is responsible for chronic stress-induced hypersensitivity. We will use a combination of targeted stereotaxic surgeries, cannula implantations, drug microinfusions, and laser stimulation to modify nociceptive, anxiety-like, and depression-like behaviors in conscious, freely moving rats.  TRAINING PLAN: Through his mentoring team and consultants, the candidate will receive training on how to conduct the optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies needed to address the research plan. Additionally, the candidate will take formal courses to promote his professional development, including responsible conduct of research, statistical analysis, and laboratory management. With formal mentorship to improve his written and oral communication, the candidate will be able to present the findings of this research at national and international meetings and publish the results in quality journals.  ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: The research in Aim 1 will demonstrate that stress-induces increases in corticotropin-releasing factor expression within the medial prefrontal cortex leading to enhanced visceral and somatic sensitivity, which signals through corticotropin-releasing factor receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis to produce the behaviors. Specific Aim 2 will show using optogenetic activation that activation of amygdala terminals or inhibition of medial prefrontal cortex terminals in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis will produce visceral and somatic hypersensitivity in non-stressed rats. The experiments will also demonstrate that inhibiting amygdala signaling (corticotropin-releasing factor) while stimulating medial prefrontal cortex signaling (glutamate) in chronically stressed rats will inhibit pain-like behaviors. Completion of these Specific Aims, along with the proposed mentoring and training, will ensure that the candidate develops his research skills to submit a future VA Merit grant and eventually becomes a life-long VA Research Career Scientist.  SIGNIFICANCE TO VETERANS HEALTH: Scientifically, the results from this project will identify a novel stress-associated brain circuit, along with the specific neurotransmitters, that modulates chronic pain. Identification of the mechanisms and circuitry involved in chronic stress-induced pain could lead to new targets for therapies to treat veterans experiencing chronic pain, which is a significant unmet healthcare burden. Professionally, this career development award will produce an independent scientist with the capability of investigating chronic pain mechanisms to provide additional tools to improve the quality-of-life for veterans."
"9537574","ABSTRACT (Project 3: Maier, Chorover, Neilson, Molina-Freaner, Barton)  Mine tailings are wastes leftover following the crushing of ores and extraction of metals such as copper during the mining process. This waste is devoid of the properties that make soils a suitable habitat for plants including soil structure, organic matter, nutrients and microorganisms. Of particular concern are legacy mine tailings which are often abandoned and are characteristically highly acidic with elevated levels of toxic metals such as arsenic and lead. Often these metals are associated with very small tailings particles that are easily windborne. These tailings deposits, which range from several to thousands of acres in size, can remain barren for decades or longer resulting in wind and water erosion into the surrounding environment especially in arid environments. Thus, these tailings have the potential to impact both human and environmental health in areas surrounding such waste sites. This project seeks to develop an alternative revegetation technology called ?compost-assisted phytostabilization? to allow lower-cost, long-term remediation of mine tailings, a major component of mine waste. Legacy mine tailings present toxic habitats for plant and microbial growth, preventing natural revegetation of these sites. The knowledge gap that impedes successful implementation of compost-assisted phytostabilization is a lack of understanding of how microbial and plant communities mediate the transition of mine tailings from plant-suppressing, acid-generating wastes to plant-sustaining substrates. The overall goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the progression in microbial community development and plant-microbe interactions that allows this transition to take place. Our objectives are to: 1) define the type of microbes and associated functions that are responsible for acidification of legacy mine tailings; 2) identify key components of the nutrient cycling and plant growth promoting microbial communities that are present in stable plant ?fertility islands? on mine tailings at our Superfund field site, but absent from areas where plant establishment is failing; and 3) identify mechanisms of root-microbe-metal interactions in established plant fertility islands that immobilize contaminant metals during phytostabilization of mine tailings. This project will improve understanding of how components of the microbial community drive the success or failure of phytostabilization. Such information is essential to close the knowledge gap that prevents successful mine-tailing remediation of abandoned mine lands which jeopardize the health of neighboring communities and ecosystems. This research will also be concurrently translated to major mining companies to improve mine-tailing remediation practices."
"9458111","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transduction of cutaneous stimuli has been previously thought to be solely a function of sensory fibers. It is now recognized that production of growth factors and neuroactivators (e.g., NGF, ATP, ACh, glutamate) by epidermal keratinocytes can have a profound effect on this process. To unravel these complex interactions and advance our understanding of the mechanisms regulating neural-keratinocyte communication, we developed optogenetic mouse models in which light activated channelrhodopsin (ChR2) is targeted to cutaneous sensory neurons. Light stimulation of the skin of these mice was found to elicit a robust nocifensive behavioral response. Electrophysiological analysis of this activation using a skin-nerve-ganglia and spinal cord ex vivo preparation showed preferential activation of C-fiber nociceptors. Thus, blue-laser light penetrates the epidermis and activates ChR2 at levels that depolarize peripheral nerve terminals. Interestingly, light activation of some neurons did not elicit response properties identical to those obtained using direct mechanical or thermal stimulation of the skin. We hypothesized this lack of a full response reflected a missing stimulus from the skin. We therefore isolated mice in which ChR2 was targeted exclusively to K14 keratin expressing keratinocytes. Remarkably, light stimulation of keratinocytes expressing ChR2 evoked changes in behavioral and electrophysiologic response properties of cutaneous sensory neurons. We also found that different subtypes of cutaneous afferents are activated at different levels suggesting heterogeneity in skin-neural communication. Using these new genetic models we propose three specific aims to advance these findings: Aim 1 experiments will examine how light-induced release of neuroactivators (e.g., ATP) from ChR2- expressing keratinocytes activates subtypes of primary sensory afferents. Aim 2 will determine how light activation of ChR2 or halorhodopsin expressed by subtypes of sensory afferents or keratinocytes affects afferent response properties. We will also determine how this activation compares to mechanical and/or thermal stimulation of the skin. Aim 3 experiments will determine the contribution of changes in keratinocytes and sensory neurons to thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in a model of inflammatory pain. These studies will determine if hyperalgesia is caused by changes in primary afferents, skin keratinocytes or both. The ability to control activation of either keratinocytes or sensory afferents will provide new insights into how the skin and sensory nervous system communicate under normal and inflamed conditions."
"9457302","Summary: Project 4 Sali We aim to identify and structurally describe key states on the self-assembly pathways of the A?, PrP, and tau polypeptides, with a broader goal to contribute towards understanding and modulating self-assembly of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Despite numerous studies, only a few high-resolution structures of states on the biologically relevant aggregation pathways have been determined, and none of them for the key oligomeric states. The essential reasons include the sparseness, noise, and ambiguity of data from any single technique, amplified by the presence of multiple structural states in the compositionally and conformationally heterogeneous samples. To overcome these challenges, integrative structure determination that simultaneously considers data from a variety of different experimental methods will be adapted and used. This approach is implemented in our Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP), an open source software package that provides programmatic support for developing and distributing integrative structure modeling protocols. Here, we will build upon this technical foundation to address the specific problem of mapping protein self- assemblies. The Specific Aims are: (1) Develop computational methods for integrative structural modeling of oligomeric and polymeric self-assemblies of proteins; (2) Determine the structures of key states on the A?, PrP, and tau self-assembly pathways; (3) Predict small-molecule, peptide, and peptide-mimetic modulators of A?, PrP, and tau self-assembly."
"9451299","Project Summary The long-term goal of our work is to understand the molecular mechanisms through which G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are activated and attenuated. These receptors are the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome, and a major target for pharmaceutical drugs. We primarily study rhodopsin and its affiliate proteins. Although structural details about these proteins are now well known, the dynamic events involved in their interactions and regulation are not. The driving force behind the current proposal is the fact that we still do not know how the retinal ligands that modulate rhodopsin activity enter and leave the receptor, or why interactions of rhodopsin with its signaling partners transducin and arrestin affect these events. Aim 1 will test our new hypothesis that rhodopsin behaves like a traditional ligand binding GPCR, with its ability to bind different ligands being governed by conformational selection. Specifically, we will pursue our exciting discovery that under some conditions, the agonist, all-trans retinal (ATR), binds to the receptor in equilibrium. We will also determine if this potential retinal equilibrium binding is altered in several disease causing rhodopsin mutations. Aim 2 focuses on using and improving novel rhodopsin-based fluorescent biosensors we have recently developed. Our ultimate goal is to use these sensors to address new research questions and to screen small molecule libraries to identify novel, non-retinal ligands that bind rhodopsin either orthosterically or allosterically and act as agonists or antagonists. We feel these goals are important for vision research ? the stability of the retinal linkage varies widely among different opsins and is a factor in some visual disease states. Aberrations in the ability of the eye to deal with the large fluxes of retinal under bright light conditions is thought to be a major contributing factor to diseases like atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD), one of the leading causes of vision loss in people over 60. Thus, a better understanding of the processes underlying retinal binding and release is fundamentally important. We also think identifying new compounds that modulate rhodopsin activity will have significant impact. Although rhodopsin was the first GPCR ever identified, there are still no small molecule drugs that bind rhodopsin with high affinity and modify its behavior. If our hypothesis is correct and retinal binding and release sometimes occurs in dynamic equilibrium, it may be possible to treat rhodopsin as a ?druggable? GPCR, and identify compounds that can modulate its activity. We think that realizing this goal is long overdue and thus our proposal is very appropriate for the R21 funding mechanism."

"9543295","ABSTRACT: PROJECT 5  Hazardous waste sites contain complex mixtures of a wide variety of toxic chemicals that contaminate and linger in the environment. The acute toxicities of numerous Superfund (SF) chemicals have been extensively investigated; however, further studies are needed to determine their chronic effects on human health. Several SF chemicals (e.g. naphthalene, PCBs, and CCl4), which are found in environmental samples from the Yurok Tribe of the Klamath River basin, and in California air, have been shown to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cultured cells. Furthermore, in animal models, long-term exposure to CCl4 leads to ER stress in tissues, resulting in fibrosis and organ damage. Thus, the central hypothesis for this project is that chronic exposure to xenobiotics leads to ER stress that then contributes to chronic inflammation, tissue fibrosis and eventual organ failure.  Based on the novel concept that the magnitude of ER stress is proportional to the amount of chronic exposure to chemicals, and monitoring ER stress will help predict resulting biological effects, the long term goal of this project is to develop a high-content and medium throughput bioassay to test the potential of SF chemicals to induce ER stress (Aim IIIA), and a biomarker of ER stress-associated biological effects for bio-fluid analysis (Aim IIIB). Toward these objectives, cell-based assays (Aim I) will be used to understand the mechanisms by which exposure to environmental toxins leads to ER stress. In addition, in animal models (Aim II, with Project 4), Project 5 will evaluate the effects of chronic exposure to hazardous chemicals on ER stress, and test if seric oxylipids are surrogate biomarkers for ER stress (with Cores A and B). The methodology developed and data obtained from the cell cultures and animal models will be directly translated in developing biomarker assays (Aim IIIA and B; with Projects 2 and 3, and Cores A and B). Finally, research findings will be utilized to serve the community at large by testing field samples collected from the Klamath River basin, the Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada foothills in California, and at or around SF-sites across the U.S. (Aim IIIC with Project 1, Cores B, C and D), as well as transferring to the scientists of the Yurok Tribe Environmental Program (with Core E).  Accordingly, the overall goals of this project are to: 1) test lipid mediators as potential diagnostic biomarkers for the magnitude of ER stress response that often contributes to organ damage, 2) develop fast, inexpensive and reliable new cell-based bioassays to detect, assess and quantitate the effects of hazardous substances on ER stress, 3) provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of chronic exposure to SF chemicals on ER stress and fibrotic diseases, 4) develop biomarkers assays for bio-fluids for the quantification of tissue-specific effects of xenobiotics on ER stress, and 5) translate our findings by assessing risk on human health, by analyzing field samples."

The Core aims to catalyze basic science, clinical and translational research in AD by participating in collaborations with subject-matter researchers, in which we develop efficient study designs, and implement and develop optimal analytic methods; as well as through collaborative software development, data management and web-based collaboration and communication methods. The Core aims to innovate in study design and analytic methods, aiming for validity, unbiasedness, and optimal use of time, subjects, and other resources in clinical trials and observational studies. In data management, we have already transitioned from the Center's CBASE system to the multi-center LAVA Clinical Research Management System, for all UDS data management tasks. LAVA will be customized in the coming period to handle the entirety of data collected in the Clinical and Neuropathology Cores, as well as summary descriptive and indexing data from the Neuroimaging Cores. We will continue to collaborate in and support an innovative move across several centers to implement shared software development based on LAVA. The Core aims to educate researchers at all levels, including undergraduates, doctoral students, and post-doctoral fellows in Biostatistics and Epidemiology, MD fellows in Neurology and allied fields, and faculty level clinician scientists. This education encompasses informal instruction on statistical principles of experimental design and data analysis, formal mentoring on research projects, and close collaboration with the Outreach and Admin Cores on Web based programs. Statistics provides consultation for MADRC and MADRC-affiliated Research and Pilot Projects, from the initial conception of the study goals, endpoints and designs, to their monitoring and final analyses. Data Management interacts with each component of the Center. The collaboration is particularly close with the Clinical Core, which enters, verifies and maintains systematic data collected regularly on all LC subjects into the LAVA database, including the UDS set of test results. We then submit the UDS data to NACC. We also assist MADRC investigators with database queries, data extraction and statistical analyses. There is a similar relation with the Neuropathology Core, which submits biomarker and autopsy data; we forward autopsy findings to NACC. We plan to receive, manage and store information from the new Neuroimaging Core. The Data and Statistics Core functions as the glue that binds other Cores together, and fulfills the Administrative Core's mandate of ensuring a smooth functioning research center. It is our overall aim to serve both as a resource for ongoing activities in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases and as a leader in both research and technical development activities."
"9552678","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        The development of epithelial cancers in multiple tissues, including the skin, is characterized by abnormalities that are both intrinsic to the cell as well as outside the cell in the extracellular environment. During the most recent funding cycle of this Merit Review, we characterized the mutational spectrum of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the second most common cancer in the country, long- associated with sunlight exposure and widespread impacts on the U.S. veteran population. Deep sequencing of 100 SCCs and 100 patient-matched normal skin specimens identified highly recurrent mutations in the COL11A1 gene (52% of SCCs), which encodes a secreted collagen chain involved in epithelial-stromal interactions as well as novel ultraviolet (UV)-signature mutations in the intracellular, kinetochore gene, KNSTRN (19% of SCCs). A major role for mutant extracellular collagen chains and mutant kinetochore proteins has not been widely appreciated in cancer before and their presence in SCC may shed light on fundamental cancer processes. This competing renewal will therefore characterize the role of these genes in epidermal tumor progression.  First, we will determine the function of recurrently mutated collagen genes in epidermal tumorigenesis. We found collagen chain mutations, concentrated at glycine or proline substitutions in the Gly-X-Y motif (with X and Y commonly proline) alpha helical collagen sequence, in 70% of SCCs, with mutation of COL11A1 the most common. In inherited monogenic human disorders, such as dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), comparable mutations in COL7A1 produce dominant-negative collagens that disrupt epithelial-stromal cohesion, suggesting a model in which tumors secrete mutant collagens to induce neoplasia-enabling abnormalities in the surrounding stroma. To explore this possibility, we will generate human epidermal tissue with defined mutant collagens in vivo then examine the resulting functional impact on epidermal invasion and tumorigenesis. Aim I will thus test a model in which secreted mutant collagens disrupt native extracellular matrix to facilitate neoplastic progression.  Second, we will define the identity and function of Kinastrin-interacting proteins as well as characterize recurrently mutated kinetochore genes in epidermal tumor progression. We observed that the KinastrinS24F UV-signature hotspot mutant prevalent in SCC accelerates epidermal tumorigenesis in vivo. In doing so, it exerts impacts characteristic of cancer, specifically increased cell division and genomic instability. These impacts are distinct and separable, however, suggesting separate mechanisms of action for each effect. To explore this, we will identify the protein interactome of both wild-type and UV-hotspot mutant KinastrinS24F proteins by vicinal protein labeling and mass spectrometry. Kinastrin-interacting proteins will then be functionally disrupted and the resulting impacts on KinastrinS24F-enhanced tumorigenesis will be determined. Also, given that 77% of SCCs were found to have mutations in additional core kinetochore genes, we also plan to disrupt selected kinetochore genes and study their impact on epidermal tumorigenesis. Aim II will thus test a model in which mutant Kinastrin interacts with discrete sets of proteins to enhance tumor progression and in which mutations in specific other kinetochore genes enable carcinogenesis.  At the end of proposed funding, we plan to have gained further insight into mechanisms of epidermal tumor progression as a foundation for future strategies for cancer prevention and treatment."

"9431039","The paradigm has long held that the epithelial Na channel ENaC, in conjunction with paracellular Cl- absorption, is the major path for salt absorption in the collecting duct whereas NCC is the main salt absorbing transporter in the DCT. Studies over the last decade have identified several new players in transcellular chloride and/or sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct (CD), including the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger Slc26a4 (pendrin), the Na+- dependent Cl-/HCO3- exchanger Slc4a8 (NDCBE), and the chloride transporter/channel Slc26a11 (KBAT). Unlike mice with single deletion of NCC or pendrin, simultaneous deletion of pendrin and NCC causes sharp increases in salt excretion, pointing to cross compensation between NCC and pendrin and their crucial role in salt absorption. No transcellular chloride-absorbing pathway has been identified in medullary collecting duct. New studies from our laboratory demonstrate that Slc26a11 (KBAT) is expressed on the apical membrane of A- intercalated cells in CCD, OMCD and iIMCD and plays an important role in salt absorption. The schematic diagrams in Figs. 2, 6 and 7 depict the interaction of KBAT and pendrin with other ion transporters in the CCD. Preliminary results: KBAT expression is enhanced in response to furosemide treatment, NCC or pendrin deletion, and salt loading, raising the possibility that KBAT plays an important role in salt absorption in the setting of enhanced delivery of salt to the collecting duct. We have generated mice with kidney specific [(or global)] ablation of KBAT, which show significant salt wasting in response to the loop diuretics or following increased dietary salt intake. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that KBAT plays an important role in salt absorption in the entire collecting duct, cross compensates for NCC or pendrin inactivation and/or inhibition and mitigates the salt loss in response to enhanced salt delivery to the collecting duct. As a result, we predict that KBAT inactivation will result in excess salt wasting consequent to diuretic therapy, in the setting of NCC or pendrin inhibition/inactivation, and in response to salt loading, the latter reflecting a unique role for this transporter in salt absorption in salt replete states [and in salt/DOCA hypertension]. Lastly, we hypothesize that KBAT and pendrin work in tandem with ENaC and/or NDCBE [(the global KO of the latter has been generated in our lab)] to reabsorb salt in CD. Innovation: The proposed research will elucidate the role of KBAT and pendrin as major players in salt reabsorption in distal nephron and as novel targets for diuretic therapy. Approach: A combination of genetically engineered mouse models, metabolic balance studies, tubule microperfusion, systemic blood pressure measurement by telemetry and molecular studies will be employed to ascertain the role of KBAT and pendrin in salt reabsorption and identify their sodium absorbing partners in the collecting duct. Insight into the role of KBAT and pendrin will significantly enhance our understanding of the role of these transporters in salt reabsorption and blood pressure homeostasis. The proposed studies will further lay the ground for development of inhibitors of KBAT and pendrin as novel diuretics in fluid overloaded states."
"9451301","Previously we have demonstrated that Src-PLD1-PKC?-cPLA2 signaling is involved in the modulation of retinal neovascularization. Our studies have also demonstrated that activation of Pak1-cofilin signaling axis is required for retinal neovascularization. Furthermore, we have shown that besides VEGFA, VEGFC via CREB- mediated activation of DLL4-NOTCH1 signaling plays an important role in the enhancement of HRMVEC migration, proliferation, sprouting and tube formation in vitro in a cell culture model and retinal neovascularization in vivo in an OIR model. During the course of these studies, we found that both VEGFA and hypoxia stimulate PKC? very robustly and depletion of its levels completely blocks the migrating and sprouting capacity of HRMVECs in response to VEGFA. We have also observed that both VEGFA and hypoxia induce Flt4 expression profoundly and this response requires PKC?-mediated JunB induction. Furthermore, both VEGFA and hypoxia triggered the induction of expression of CDC6, a regulatory component of pre-replication complex (pre-RC) and involved in loading the mini chromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7) onto the DNA, which plays a rate-limiting step in replication. In addition, down regulation of CDC6 levels completely abolished VEGFA-induced DNA synthesis. Based on these novel discoveries, we propose that PKC? via enhancing EC migration and sprouting and CDC6 via enhancing EC proliferation play an integral role in the modulation retinal neovascularization. To test this central hypothesis, we will address the following four specific aims. Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that PKC? mediates hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization. Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that JunB mediates hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization. Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that PKC?-JunB signaling axis targets Flt4 induction in mediating retinal neovascularization. Aim 4. To test the hypothesis that CDC6 plays an essential role in retinal neovascularization. The results of the proposed experiments may provide novel information in regard to the molecular mechanisms underling pathological retinal neovascularization, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic compounds against this ocular disease."

"9463344","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Striated muscles represent the pinnacle of cytoskeletal organization among cells, with highly ordered arrays of actin and myosin filaments in tightly arranged sarcomeres, all poised to respond to electrochemical signals with cell-wide coordinated contraction. Genetic defects in sarcomeric proteins result in debilitating myopathies of heart and skeletal muscle. Understanding how these complex cytoskeletal structures normally assemble will be vital to therapeutic resolution of these diseases. Formins are ubiquitous actin-organizing proteins that play a critical but poorly understood role in directing sarcomere formation. In mice, the formin FHOD3 is required for mature sarcomere formation in heart muscle cells required for embryonic development, and a naturally occurring variant of the FHOD3 gene in humans is tied to an increased incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the most common cause of sudden cardiac-related deaths in young adults. A critical barrier to understanding how FHOD3 functions is that loss of the formin likely has immediate (short- term) as well as indirect (long-term) consequences that cannot currently be resolved in mammalian systems. To understand how FHOD3 and other formins contribute to sarcomere organization, we are employing the powerful genetic model system Caenorhabditis elegans. Sarcomere assembly in this roundworm is also promoted by an FHOD3-related formin FHOD-1, and a second formin CYK-1. Using this model, we will address three fundamental questions: 1) Do formins direct the assembly of the actin component of sarcomeres?  Using worms with conditional formin mutations, we will test whether an acute loss of formin activity blocks actin filament assembly in developing sarcomeres. 2) Is formin-dependent actin filament nucleation needed for sarcomere assembly?  We will design mutations that disrupt the in vitro nucleating activites of FHOD-1 and CYK-1, and determine whether these mutations block the ability of these formins to promote sarcomere formation in vivo. 3) How does formin loss affect non-actin components of sarcomeres?  Muscle myosin heavy chain IIA expression depends on FHOD-1 activity. We will dissect the mechanism of this regulation as an archetype of how formin activity can control the assembly of non-actin sarcomeric components in vivo. With these experiments, we will reveal the mechanisms by which these highly conserved proteins direct the core process of sarcomere formation in striated muscle, which is key to understanding and treating diseases of these complicated and vital cells."
"9468242","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality in the U.S. Among CVDs, heart failure (HF) is a sig- nificant public health burden contributing not only to human suffering, but also to increasing healthcare expend- itures. CVDs arise in the setting of complex gene-environment interactions; the underlying genetics within an in- dividual influences how environmental and hormonal stimuli and stresses affect cardiac function and cause path- ology. The cardiomyocyte circadian clock is a genetically-programmed intrinsic cell-autonomous molecular mechanism that allows the heart to anticipate environmental stimuli and stresses and subsequently facilitates responses essential for maintaining cardiac function. Disruption of the circadian clock mechanism in mice and humans (e.g., through genetic polymorphisms or environmental alterations such as shift work, sleep disturbance, or eating behavior modulation) negatively impact cardiometabolic health. Furthermore, germline deletion of BMAL1, a core transcription factor component of the clock mechanism, yields an age onset dilated cardiomyo- pathy and reduced lifespan. We recently found that BMAL1 deletion specifically from cardiomyocytes (CBK mouse) recapitulates this pathologic phenotype, exposing an essential role for the clock in the heart. However, the mechanism by which cardiomyocyte circadian clock disruption leads to cardiomyopathy is unknown. Multiple endocrine system components are circadian. Evidence is emerging that cell autonomous cir- cadian clocks not only drive the temporal secretion of hormones, but also modulate time-of-day-dependent target tissue sensitivity to these hormones. In doing so, circadian clocks add a new layer to homeostasis; not only do the level of, and the sensitivity to, a stimulus play an important role, but also the timing. Circulating levels of the pituitary hormone, growth hormone (GH), exhibit notable circadian rhythm in humans. In contrast, nothing is known about rhythms in GH sensitivity. Chronic GH elevation yields cardiomegaly and HF. GH exerts many of its biological actions by inducing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1); a mouse model of cardiomyocyte-specific IGF-1 overexpression results in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our recent preliminary data suggest time-of-day- dependent oscillation of GH sensitivity in the heart, which depends on the cardiomyocyte circadian clock. More- over, CBK hearts exhibit greater GH sensitivity, with elevated cardiac IGF-1 gene expression, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and HF. Together, these observations lead us to hypothesize that the cardiomyocyte circa- dian clock modulates GH sensitivity, and that disruption of this mechanism confers local IGF-1-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and HF via augmented GH sensitivity. Accordingly, we will test the hypotheses that: Aim 1. Cardiomyocyte circadian clock modulation of GH sensitivity is essential for maintenance of cardiac function. We will determine whether: 1A. The cardiomyocyte circadian clock modulates sensitivity of the heart to GH in a time-of-day-dependent manner (physiology); 1B. Genetic disruption of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock imbalances the GH/IGF-1 signaling axis, thereby precipitating cardiomyopathy (pathology). Aim 2. Disruption of circadian behaviors/environmental parameters (e.g., fasting/feeding and light/dark cycles) augments cardiac GH/IGF-1 signaling, thereby predisposing to contractile dysfunction. We will determine whether: 2A. Manipulation of circadian behavior (e.g., fasting/feeding cycles) or environment (e.g., light/dark cycle) impact GH sensitivity and GH/IGF-1 signaling in the heart; 2B. Restoration of GH/IGF-1 signaling in the heart following environmental/behavioral manipulations attenuates susceptibility to contractile dysfunction. Our studies will identify mechanisms linking cardiomyocyte circadian clock dysfunction to augmented cardiac GH/IGF-1 signaling. As age-associated CBK cardiomyopathy has similarity with that seen in GH excess, our studies may foster the novel concept that both GH excess and enhanced GH sensitivity un- derlie cardiac dysfunction induced by common circadian perturbations (e.g., diet, light exposure, sleep), and provide sound rationale for future therapeutic strategies targeting the GH/IGF-1 signaling axis in HF."
"9567496","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been an increasingly common and complicated treatment issue for veteran and non-veteran patients over the past decade. One of the most difficult management issues is that of recurrent CDI. ~20% of patients who are successfully treated with either metronidazole or vancomycin will have a recurrent episode. Those who have already had a recurrent episode have ~50% chance of third diarrheal episode and some patients will have recurrent CDI for months or years. In addition, recurrent CDI has had a major impact on healthcare facilities because of frequent readmission rates to acute care facilities. Several host factors have been implicated as risks for recurrent CDI. However, there has been relatively little attention paid to pathogen or bacterial factors that might influence the risk of recurrence. The increase in rates of CDI and complications such as recurrent CDI over the past decade has coincided with the emergence of the epidemic C. difficile BI/027/NAP1 strain. Several potential virulence factors expressed by this strain have been proposed, but recent evidence suggests that binary toxin (CDT) produced by this strain and other clinically important (e.g., BK/078/NAP7) strains may play a critical adjunctive role in CDI pathogenesis. C. difficile binary toxin (CDT) is unrelated to the large, single unit glycosylating toxins, toxin A and B. This 2-component (binary) toxin acts by ADP-ribosylation of the cytoskeletal protein, actin, resulting in microtubular structural changes and epithelial cell membrane protrusions which increase adherence and colonization of C. difficile. Our research aims are designed to test the hypothesis that binary toxin increases the risk of recurrent CDI by two experimental lines of investigation. First, we will use the hamster model of CDI to demonstrate the effect of binary toxin by using isogenic mutants of C. difficile in which the binary gene toxin is knocked out. Second, we will use a newly developed immunoassay for binary toxin to test patient stool specimens and correlate the presence of fecal binary toxin with clinical recurrence of CDI. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1. Establish a reproducible hamster model of CDI recurrence.  Aim 1a) Construct binary toxin mutants in the epidemic-associated BI and BK strains (CDTneg) for the baseline experiments in the hamster model  Aim 1b) Establish a reproducible recurrence rate in the hamster model using binary toxin mutants (CDTneg) & confirm increased recurrence rates using respective parent (CDTpos) strains 2. Determine the mechanism of increased CDI recurrence due to binary toxin Aim 2a) Determine the mechanism in vitro using a human intestinal epithelial cell line Aim 2b) Determine the mechanism in vivo in hamsters 3.

Metastatic breast cancer is uniformly fatal. Objective: Our goal is to identify new therapeutic approaches to prevent mortality from breast cancer metastasis. We seek novel approaches to exploit the established contribution of the Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway to breast tumor growth and dissemination. The principle COX-2 product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) exerts biological effects by binding to the E series of G protein-coupled prostaglandin receptors EP1-4. Results: We have made significant progress towards elucidating the unique role of individual EP receptors on malignant and host immune cells. EP1 suppresses while EP4 promotes metastasis. Our most important finding is that EP4 supports the survival of breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) with heightened tumorigenic, metastatic and chemotherapy resistant properties that contribute to relapse and mortality. EP4 also subverts innate antitumor immunity by inhibiting Natural Killer (NK) cells and inducing immune suppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) but the role of NK and MDSC in control of BCSC is not known. Our central hypothesis is that EP4 promotes metastasis by directly supporting BCSC and indirectly by suppressing antitumor immunity. Systemic targeting of multiple EP4-positive cells will result in additive, if not synergistic therapeutic responses. BCSC, expressing high levels of EP4 will be inhibited directly by EP4 blockade. EP4 inhibitors will protect anti-tumor NK cells from PGE2-mediated immune suppression and will prevent the induction of MDSC that otherwise directly support BCSC survival and prevent effective anti- tumor immunity. Methods: Using a combination of novel pharmacologic EP inhibitors and genetic approaches in orthotopic, xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models of metastatic breast cancer, we will determine the mechanism by which EP4 promotes and EP1 inhibits BCSC. Specific Aims: (1) Determine the effect of EP4/COX-2 targeting on BCSC. We will determine the mechanism by which EP4 supports BCSC, identify the relevant signaling pathways and will determine how EP4 is regulated in BCSC. (2) Determine the effect of EP4/COX-2 targeting on NK effector functions. Little is known regarding the role of innate immunity in the control of BCSC. We will characterize the role of NK cells in the recognition and killing of BCSC and will determine how EP4 regulates these interactions. (3) Determine the effect of EP4 targeting on MDSC and TAM. We will determine if EP4 blockade neutralizes the deleterious immune suppressive effects of MDSC and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). We will determine if MDSC directly support BCSC through an EP4-regulated mechanism that is independent of effects on innate or adaptive immunity. We will identify a clinically relevant combination therapy that may target cancer stem cells as well as non-stem cell populations. Impact: We will identify EP4 as a new therapeutic target, expressed on host cells and BCSC responsible for relapse and breast cancer mortality. EP4 targeting will overcome immune suppression leading to effective tumor control. Our results will inform the design of clinical trias under development in collaboration with RaQualia/AskAt to determine if administration of an EP4 antagonist reduces breast cancer mortality in female and male Veterans and in the general population with breast cancer."
"9462779","Core C: DMS Core Abstract:  The Data Management and Statistics (DMS) Core facilitates research and collaborations with NACC initiatives and others by providing high quality data management and methodological support. The University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (PITT-ADRC) has compiled a database that includes information about more than 4000 participants collected over 25 years. The DMS Core works with PITT-ADRC personnel to maximize data completeness and accuracy by developing systems with sophisticated quality control measures for capturing and computerizing data and for facilitating the work of Core and Project personnel, e.g., developing and implementing a Scheduling and Tracking System for the Clinical Core, a Participant Lookup System used by the Neuropathology and Clinical Cores, and a Specimen Tracking System for the Neurogenetics Core. DMS Core personnel also support authorized users of the PITT-ADRC database by preparing reports, creating datasets used for analyses, providing programming and analytical consultation and support, and serving as Honest Broker to obtain protected data for authorized investigators.  To contribute to the educational mission of the PITT-ADRC, and to encourage wider dissemination of PITT- ADRC data, the DMS Core proposes two new initiatives in this funding period. The first is to continue developing the SHared Alzheimer's REgistry (SHARE)] database that contains a subset of the extensive data collected about participants, focusing on our strengths of neuropsychological and detailed psychiatric assessments - the latter being unique to the PITT-ADRC. The second is to develop a system that will allow users with approved access to query the SQL server database to facilitate and expand its use."
"9633987","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): D2 dopamine receptors (D2R) are significantly downregulated in drug abusers of all types. However, both the functional consequences of D2R downregulation for drug abuse, and the molecular mechanisms that mediate drug-induced loss of D2R in vivo remain unresolved. Dopamine receptor-mediated signaling is regulated by numerous processes. One way is by endocytosis, whereby receptors are removed from the cell surface after activation. Following endocytosis, distinct dopamine receptors are sorted differentially: the D1Rs are recycled, while the D2Rs, are degraded. We have identified a protein, GASP1, that is responsible for the targeting of the D2R for degradation after endocytosis. We went on to propose that the balance of D1R-Gs signaling versus D2R-Gi signaling in circuits important to drug abuse becomes disrupted due to downregulation of D2R under conditions of high dopamine tone, and thereby promotes changes in plasticity and behavior. In support of this hypothesis, genetic disruption of GASP1, prevents cocaine induced downregulation of D2Rs and attenuates the development of locomotor sensitization to cocaine in mice. Here, we will examine how altering the balance of D2R and D1R signaling impacts sensitivity to both the locomotor (Aim 1) and rewarding (Aim 2) effects of cocaine. We will then assess whether changes in the balance of dopamine receptor signaling in selected neurons of the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, basolateral amygdala, or medial pre-frontal cortex are either necessary or sufficient to affect these behaviors (Aim 3). We will accomplish this, in part, with novel transgenic tools we have generated, including conditional and non-conditional GASP1 knock out (KO) mice, and a knock-in mouse expressing a D2R that does not bind GASP1. We will also approach the question of the role of D2R downregulation in altering behavior using commercially available, and therapeutically important, dopaminergic ligands. Although the pharmacology of these ligands have been studied for some time, the innovation in our approach lies in our examination of not only classical pharmacological properties, such as ligand affinity and selectivity, but also the effects of these ligands on both endocytic and post-endocytic receptor trafficking."
"9459367","Vitamin A is an essential nutrient for all mammals. Many biological processes, including and foremost vision, are crucially dependent on its adequate supply for proper function. Alterations of vitamin A metabolism can result in a wide spectrum of ocular defects and lead to blindness. Retinol (vitamin A alcohol) is the predominant circulating vitamin A form in the fasting state. In times of need (i.e. in the absence of dietary vitamin A intake), in order to distribute vitamin A to the target peripheral tissues, retinol is released in the bloodstream from the liver, the main body storage site of the vitamin, bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP). Inside the cells, retinol binds specific intracellular carriers, namely cellular retinol-binding proteins, and it serves as a precursor for the active vitamin A forms: retinaldehyde, critical for vision, and retinoic acid, the ligand for specific nuclear receptors that regulate the transcription of hundreds of target genes. How retinol is released from the retinol-RBP complex and internalized by the cell has been subject of debate for decades. STRA6, the putative plasma membrane receptor for RBP, was identified in 2007. However, its mechanism of action has remained elusive, not least due to the absence of any structural information. Here we present the structure of STRA6 determined to 4.2  resolution by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. STRA6 is a dimer, with each protomer contributing nine transmembrane and a horizontal intramembrane helix that is positioned at the core of the dimer interface. Unexpectedly, the C-terminus of each protomer is tightly bound to calmodulin in a compact, non-canonical arrangement. The structure suggests possible sites for interaction with extracellular and intracellular carriers for retinol, and modes for internalization of retinol. The atomic model of STRA6 provides a template to guide our understanding at a molecular level on how this protein may function, and to further investigate its physiological role."
"9506711","We propose to continue our research group?s work to identify and validate hormonal markers that predict risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Although the estrogen pathway plays a critical role in breast carcinogenesis, accruing evidence suggests measurement of the classic estrogens only, as done in prior epidemiologic studies (including our own) may miss a sizeable component of estrogenic activity that is etiologically relevant to risk. Further, the insulin pathway is another critical, but relatively understudied, hormonal pathway that may impact breast cancer risk. Using a prospective nested case-control design, we plan to analyze blood samples collected from the 32,826 participants in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) who provided a blood sample in 1989-90 and, for 18,743 of these women, a second sample in 1999-2000. Specifically, we propose to evaluate the independent associations of 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC; a recently identified endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator) as well as an estrogen bioassay (that assesses estrogen pathway activation) in relation to breast cancer risk. We also will evaluate several new aspects of the relationship between plasma c-peptide (reflecting insulin secretion) and breast cancer risk. With 26 years of follow-up and two blood samples in a subset of women, we will evaluate the importance of timing of c-peptide exposure in breast carcinogenesis. Further, we will assess whether the c-peptide/breast cancer relationship varies by breast tumor expression of insulin receptor or several markers of PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway activation. Previous work, by not accounting for these tumor molecular characteristics, may have underestimated the etiologic importance of insulin in breast cancer risk and hence opportunities for prevention. We also will evaluate if c-peptide (and secondarily the novel estrogen related markers) improve the Gail and Rosner-Colditz risk prediction models, and validate the addition of multiple biomarkers (i.e., the plasma hormones, a genetic risk score and mammographic density) to these models in the prospective Mayo Mammography Health Study (MMHS) and Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS). The MMHS and MCCS have risk factor and biomarker information that is comparable to that in the NHS. In addition to providing one or two blood samples, NHS cohort members have provided detailed exposure and disease information biennially (including data on most known or probable breast cancer risk factors) since 1976, and, for about 70% of breast cancer cases, we have collected formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue, thus allowing molecular analyses of the tumor. The recently funded NHS UM1 grant will provide cohort follow-up, breast cancer documentation, and important covariate data, increasing the cost-effectiveness of the proposed project. This project, by working across the translational research spectrum from discovery of novel hormonal biomarkers to practical application of well confirmed biomarkers in risk prediction models, should add considerable insight into breast cancer etiology and ways to better identify high risk women who may benefit from risk reduction efforts (e.g., chemoprevention)."
"9470911","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to determine the role of natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) in mitigating acute lung injury. Diseases such as pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are characterized by movement of fluid, protein and cells from the pulmonary circulation to the interstitial and alveola space. This transudation of vascular fluid impairs gas exchange and initiates a cascade of inflammatory events that leads to acute lung failure. Cell signaling pathways that regulate fluid and cellular transudation across the pulmonary vascular membrane play critical roles in determining the extent of lung damage that occurs and the time it takes for the lung to recover. The natriuretic peptides (NP) are a family of proteins that play critically important roles in maintaining appropriate amounts of fluid in the circulation. NPs are released from the heart in response to increased blood volume and act to increase the permeability of blood vessels, thereby facilitating transudation of fluid, solutes and proteins from the intravascular to the interstitial space of systemic vascular beds. In the pulmonary circulation, however, NPs appear to protect against increased acute lung injury and pulmonary edema formation. In fact, numerous studies have shown that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) blunts acute lung injury in animal models and clinical studies. This differential effect of NPs on vascular permeability in the systemic and pulmonary vascular beds may be explained by differences in effects of the NP-receptors. Previous studies by other investigators suggest that enhancement of vascular permeability is mediated by NPR-A. However, recent studies from our laboratory suggest that the protective effects of NPs on acute lung injury are mediated by NPR-C. This proposal will test the hypothesis that NPR-C protects against acute lung injury by determining if lung injury is worse in mice lacking NPR-C and if NPs fail to protect against lung injury in NPR-C deficient mice. The proposal will also determine if barrier function in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells can be altered by increasing or decreasing NPR-C expression. Other studies aim to elucidate downstream signaling pathways responsible for the protective effects of NPR-C by determining if the protective effect of NPR-C is mediated by activation of G-inhibitory protein (Gai) and downstream modulation of cAMP. Finally, animal studies will be performed to determine if increased expression of NPR-C in vivo can protect against acute lung injury. Pulmonary edema formation is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in severe cases of acute respiratory failure. Identification of receptors and their associated signal transduction pathways responsible for maintenance of intact pulmonary endothelial barrier function is vital to furthering our understanding of pulmonary permeability and developing new therapies for patients with acute lung injury."
"9453379","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hereditary cancer syndromes are caused by a germline mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene and illustrate the potential of genomic information to tailor medical care. Lynch Syndrome is the most common hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndrome affecting 1.2 million people in the United States. Its prevalence is similar to the more well-known Hereditary Breast and Ovar- ian Cancer Syndrome. Lynch Syndrome is caused by a mutation in one of four mismatch repair genes. Lifetime colorectal can- cer risk in Lynch Syndrome is dependent on causative gene and is highly variable, ranging between 10-80%, an 8-fold differ- ence. At present, colorectal cancer management strategies in Lynch Syndrome are uniform, consisting of a lifetime of annual to biennial invasive screening tests and prophylactic risk-reducing surgery. However, given the variability in gene-dependent cancer risk, the patient burden associated with noted intensive clinical management, and the potential for over/under-utiliza- tion, there is a critical need for evidence-based determination of gene-dependent colorectal cancer clinical management in Lynch Syndrome. The overall goal of this National Cancer Institute (NCI) K07 Career Development Award is to identify opti- mal gene-dependent colorectal cancer prevention and treatment strategies in Lynch Syndrome, using decision analysis, a meth- odologic pillar of health services research. Aims 1 and 2 generate pivotal inputs, gene-dependent colorectal cancer risk and utilization of recommended care, respectively, for the development of a Markov Model in Aim 3 that will determine optimal colorectal cancer clinical management in Lynch Syndrome by gene. Results from this study will help ensure the appropriate use of clinical care for those with Lynch Syndrome, moving the field closer to the promise of Precision Medicine and fulfilling the NCI's mandate to ?take the genome to the clinic.? Dr. Sharaf is a gastroenterologist and budding health services researcher with a clinical focus on cancer genetics. His career goal is to become an independently-funded physician-scientist with exper- tise in cancer-related decision analysis. The proposed K07 Award will give him experience in the conduct of meta-analysis and large database analysis. These methodologies are fundamental for devising precise inputs for Markov models and for Markov model calibration and validation. He will also learn the conduct of Markov-modeling itself. In total, this health-services skill- set is versatile and can be applied to a variety of diseases. His long-term goal is to lead a cancer-focused Evidence-based Prac- tice Center. This NCI K07 Award will produce preliminary data for R01 applications that validate the Markov Model devel- oped in Aim 3 and expand it to explore gender-specific colorectal cancer risk and gene-specific management for endometrial and ovarian cancers (also Lynch-related), to ultimately set the stage for comparative modeling with the NCI's Cancer Interven- tion and Surveillance Modeling Network to enable national health policy recommendations for the gene-dependent clinical management of Lynch Syndrome."
"9543286","ABSTRACT: CORE B The Bioanalytical and Statistics Core B is a centralized resource comprised of eight investigators with complementary expertise and substantial collaborative experience in understanding the impact of hazardous environmental substances on human health. Along with Core A (Analytical), Core B shares the goal of detecting biomarkers of exposure to and effect of hazardous chemicals in humans and the environment. The Core's purpose is to provide integrated, high-quality bioanalytical and statistical services to the UC Davis ? NIEHS Superfund Research Program. The bioanalysis component provides a broad suite of assays, developed from the past 25 years of SRP support, to assess the presence of hazardous chemicals and/or effects of these materials on selected biological pathways. Core B inherits mature bioanalytical methods from Project 3 (Immunoassays) and the previous Project 5 (Cell-Based Assays). More than 25 immunoassays are available for various hazardous chemicals. Cell-based assays assess chemical interaction with a variety of receptors as biomarkers of effect. Most of these assays are already part of the EPA Tox21 screening program. Enzyme assays for specific pathways are also be provided by the Core. These bioanalytical methods are integral to Project 1 (Bioremediation) as they aim to identify toxic samples of human or ecosystem health concern to Core C (Community Engagement). Project 1 and Core A (Analytical) will identify toxic components of samples testing positive in bioanalysis methods, then immunoassays in this Core will be transferred to the community to build their capacity to assess the occurrence of the identified toxicant to help them determine their exposures. Projects 3 (Immunoassays), 4 (MOS and Cardiac Toxicity) and 5 (Exposure-induced ER Stress) are developing methods for Core B and as such benefit from experience provided by Core personnel that will result in valid, robust tools for exposure assessment.  Core B includes four PhD-level statisticians with substantial relevant experience in collaborative multidisciplinary research. These investigators have worked with the Center's Projects and Cores to refine their proposals and to identify the research and educational activities requiring specialized statistical expertise. To facilitate effective, economical and continuous support, primary and secondary statistical consultants have been assigned to each Center Project or Core. Assignments were specified to promote an effective alignment of specialized statistical skills with the particular needs of individual Projects and Cores.  The Core's quality assurance and management plans allow it to identify and respond to emerging opportunities or challenges confronting the Center, maximizing the reliability, utility and impact of the UCD SRC."
"9378724","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Recently, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) were discovered to transport microRNAs to cells, leading to altered gene expression. HDL-miRNA cargo and its delivery to target cells can be altered by different disease states and may be responsible for some disease sequelae. A common disease sequela of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is cardiovascular (CV) disease, which is increased two-fold, but underlying mechanisms are unclear. A potential mechanism is delivery of altered HDL-miRNA cargo to cells that promote vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Currently, nothing is known about HDL-miRNA cargo and its transfer in RA.  The overarching hypothesis is that in RA altered HDL-miRNA cargo transfer modulates the responses of cells that promote vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, which are common in RA and occur early in CV disease development. The rationale for the proposed research is that miRNAs are powerful gene expression regulators, and several miRNAs are altered in both RA and CV disease. HDL interacts with only a small proportion of cells, facilitating a unique accumulation of miRNAs. Moreover, HDL is capable of targeted miRNA delivery specifically to cells of the immune system and endothelial cells.  Building on preliminary  data, Aim 1 will define the HDL-miRNA cargo in RA by comparing the cargo of patients with RA without coronary artery disease (CAD), patients with RA with CAD, and control subjects, and by determining which miRNAs are associated with inflammation and endothelial function in RA. Aim 2 will define the differential transfer (RA vs control) of HDL- miRNAs to macrophages and their impact on macrophages inflammatory cytokine expression and on plaque inflammation and atherosclerosis. Aim 3 will define the differential transfer (RA vs control) of HDL-miRNAs to endothelial cells and their impact on adhesion molecule expression and nitric oxide bioavailability, and on atherosclerosis.  The proposed research is significant because it mechanistically addresses how cellular functions, which are important in the pathogenesis of CV disease, are altered through a novel mechanism (HDL-miRNA transfer) that could be modified. Moreover, this proposal is innovative because it will be the first to examine HDL-miRNAs in RA and has wide implications for future investigations that are not limited to the development of CV disease in RA. This study is high impact because it could identify fundamental, targetable mechanisms underlying early vascular changes which promote CV disease in RA, and could lead to targeted miRNA therapeutics."
"9527532","PROJECT SUMMARY  Candidate: My long-term career goal is to be an independent patient-oriented researcher who will improve outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU) by investigating questions and developing interventions at the intersection of sleep physiology, circadian biology, and critical illness. I have proposed career development activities that will prepare me to successfully conduct a series of investigations focused on understanding ICU circadian rhythm abnormalities and the associated effects on ICU sleep disruption, delirium, and broader critical illness outcomes. I have relevant clinical training in critical care and sleep medicine. I have gained initial patient-oriented research experience by conducting several studies related to sleep disruption in the ICU. In this K23 application, I am proposing specific training in circadian biology with a focus on (1) circadian rhythm measurement, (2) circadian entrainment interventions, and (3) longitudinal data analysis. Completion of these training activities will bridge current knowledge gaps and set up future success as an independent investigator.  Mentors and Environment: I will be mentored by Drs. Henry Klar Yaggi, Margaret Pisani, and Nancy Redeker, a team of experienced, committed experts in the fields of sleep medicine, critical care medicine, circadian measurement, ICU delirium, and patient-oriented research. This team has demonstrated collaborative success, and each member brings unique expertise. I will also work with advisors Dr. Kenneth Wright (circadian biology expert) and Dr. Terrence Murphy (analytics expert). My department Chairperson (Dr. Gary Desir) and Section Chief (Dr. Naftali Kaminski) have provided assurance that I will dedicate at least 75% of my time to career development activities. We will recruit study subjects from the Yale-New Haven Hospital Medical ICU which is a high volume ICU with sufficient patients to make this project feasible. Our section's Translational Research Core and Medical ICU Biorepository will support this project.  Mentored Research Project: Delirium affects 50-80% of medical ICU patients. Prevention and treatment strategies are limited, and delirium is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality. Because ICU sleep disruption is likely to be a contributor to the development of ICU delirium, sleep promotion is recommended for delirium treatment and prevention. Currently, there is a lack of investigation regarding the potentially significant contribution of circadian abnormalities to the problem of ICU sleep disruption and consequent delirium. Circadian abnormalities are potentially modifiable, and thus constitute a novel therapeutic target for ICU delirium. This project will prospectively study ICU patients (N=100) with detailed circadian measures. We will examine the impact of ICU light levels on circadian abnormalities and examine the association between circadian abnormalities and days of delirium. In addition, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (N=50) to assess the feasibility of providing daytime bright light to ICU patients to promote circadian entrainment."

This proposal will enable Dr. Singh to expand his translational research program, integrate fellows and junior faculty in to the program, and provide protected time so that the can mentor additional MD fellows. The proposal also provides time and infrastructure to help Dr. Singh enhance his own mentoring skills. The two research projects described involve face-to-face interactions with patients Project 1 exploits preliminary findings which show that infecting P. aeruginosa strains evolve to produce genetically diverse but clonally-related populations within CF lungs, and that the relative abundance of subpopulations change as patients are treated with antibiotics. This is important because subpopulations that increase during treatment have phenotypes that enable them to resist treatment in vivo, while those that decrease lack resistance functions. Studying these subpopulations enable us to test novel hypotheses about the mechanisms enabling bacteria to withstand antibiotics in chronic infections. Project 2 exploits preliminary findings that show that upper airway contamination may confound DNA-based measurements of lung microbiota. Accurately identifying the bacteria causing CF infections is among the most important tasks in CF infection research. We propose using the novel 2-scope method, along with advanced analytic methods, to test the hypotheses that some of the taxa identified in upper airway samples from CF children using DNA-based methods are oropharyngeal contaminants, or are derived from non viable cells."

"9456555","Project Summary Sexual minority women in the United States are more likely to drink alcohol, engage in heavy drinking, and experience alcohol-related problems than are heterosexual women. Yet, to date, no evidence-based intervention or prevention efforts have been developed to reduce alcohol consumption in female sexual minority community settings. The proposed research seeks to narrow the disparity in alcohol intervention research by examining an innovative gamified personalized normative feedback (PNF) intervention to reduce drinking among members of a local sexual minority women community found to frequent Facebook and overestimate norms related to peers? general alcohol use and drinking to cope with sexual minority stigma. Our newly developed GANDR (Gamified Alcohol Norm Discovery and Readjustment) PNF format takes the well- established core components of a PNF alcohol intervention and delivers these components within an inviting, Facebook-connected, social game. This intervention format is designed to be more appealing, engaging, believable, positively received, and thus, effective than standard web-based PNF and can be culturally tailored to appeal to a number of different populations, including those typically hard to recruit into alcohol interventions. GANDR LA, the version developed for sexual minority women residing in Los Angeles County, delivers PNF on alcohol use and stigma-coping behaviors within the context of an online game about sexual minority stereotypes which incorporates users? Facebook photos to increase believability and a point-based reward system to increase motivation and engagement. In addition, to decrease defensive reactions and increase appeal, feedback topics are ostensibly selected by chance in GANDR LA with treatment PNF on alcohol use and stigma-coping behaviors provided alongside feedback on control topics of high interest to community members (e.g., activism, relationships, etc.). Additional appeal and credibility are gained through GANDR LA?s sponsorship and promotion by a collaborating sexual minority community non-profit organization viewed as a trusted source for health and social information by members of the target community. After documenting sexual minority community norms (AIM 1) through an initial round of play (N=1275), a sub-sample of 675 sexual minority female drinkers will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 unique sequences of feedback (i.e., Alcohol & Stigma-Coping, Alcohol & Control, or Control topics only) during 3 intervention rounds taking place over a 6-month period. The randomized feedback sequences and multiple rounds of play will allow us to determine whether PNF on alcohol use corrects drinking norms, and reduces sexual minority women?s alcohol consumption and negative consequences relative to PNF on control topics (AIM 2: H1), examine whether providing PNF on stigma-coping behaviors in addition to alcohol use further reduces alcohol use and consequences beyond standard alcohol PNF (AIM 2: H2), and identify mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness (AIM 3)."
"9463499","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper development of the cortex, the command center of the brain, entails extensive production of neurons. This is largely achieved through the robust asymmetric division of radial glial progenitor cells (RGPCs) residing in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the developing cortex. While excellent progress has been made over the past twenty years in our understanding of RGPC division and neurogenesis in the developing cortex, our knowledge of the precise regulation and function of the centrosome, a key subcellular organelle for microtubule organization, cell division and ciliogenesis, during cortical neurogenesis remains limited. The goal of this application is to fill this knowledge gap, which wil also be crucial for understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of microcephaly, a neuro-developmental disorder that is characterized by small brain size as a result of deficient neuron production in the developing cortex. To date, at least eight autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) loci and seven genes have been identified for autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH). Remarkably, all the defined MCPH genes encode centrosomal proteins, underscoring the unique importance of proper centrosome regulation and function in the production of normal neuron populations in the developing cortex. The central hypothesis is that the mature centrosome is essential for maintaining RGPCs in the VZ - a progenitor cell niche - and ensuring their proper division and survival in the developing cortex. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of the strong published and preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory. Guided by preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Reveal centrosome properties and behavior in interphase and mitotic RGPCs; 2) Define the functions of the centrosome in RGPCs; and, 3) Explore the mechanisms that regulate centrosome behavior in RGPCs. The experimental focus of this application is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the behavior, function and regulation of the centrosome in RGPCs as they proceed through the cell cycle to produce neurons and link it to microcephaly, using state-of-the- art imaging and mouse genetic approaches. As of this writing, few such studies have been reported. Accomplishing the aims in this project will not only provide important insights into RGPC division and cortical neurogenesis, but also help to define the cellular basis of microcephaly caused by genetic abnormalities, and thereby provide new ideas for early diagnosis and treatment."
"9552686","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Microvascular thrombosis and inflammation are interrelated in a variety of illnesses including sepsis, the body's inflammatory response to an infection. Sepsis is the most common admission diagnosis in intensive care units in the VA system and the leading cause of death in adult intensive care units in the United States. Veterans with sepsis and organ dysfunction have >50% mortality and microvascular thrombosis is implicated in organ dysfunction in sepsis. Thus, understanding the mechanisms responsible for microvascular thrombosis has major clinical significance to the VA health care system. Platelets are increasingly recognized to be important mediators of the inflammatory response, in addition to their well-established role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Recent work from this laboratory demonstrates that endotoxin, a major component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, promotes microvascular platelet thrombus formation in vivo via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on platelets. Endotoxin and platelet TLR4 promote release of histones, nuclear proteins that may also link inflammation, platelet activation and thrombosis. Our preliminary data show that histones promote microvascular thrombosis, they activate platelets and they induce endothelial cells to release von Willebrand factor (VWF). This proposal will address the mechanisms by which platelet TLR4 and histones promote microvascular thrombosis. The central hypothesis is that platelet TLR4 mediates microvascular thrombosis in endotoxemia via microparticles and histone-induced VWF release. The proposal will utilize in vivo and in vitro techniques; in vivo it will utilize two intravital microscopy modls well established in our lab and others. These models allow assessment of the kinetics of microvascular thrombosis and platelet- endothelial adhesive interactions in real-time. In vitro experiments involve assessment of platelet adhesion to cultured endothelial cells and immobilized substrates under flow and platelet aggregation. Two aims are proposed: Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms by which platelet TLR4 promotes microvascular thrombosis in endotoxemia. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms by which histones promote microvascular thrombosis. Completion of the proposed experiments will broaden understanding of the links between inflammation and microvascular thrombosis in sepsis, and will provide the basis for future work aimed at preventing microvascular thrombosis in inflammation. The long-term goal is to develop optimal therapeutic approaches for patients with sepsis and other inflammatory diseases."
"9462145","Abstract Uveitis is the sixth leading cause of blindness in the United States, causing ~10% of new cases of blindness, often in the prime of life. Scleritis and cicatrizing conjunctivitis related to pemphigoid add to the burden of ocular inflammatory disease. Advances in characterizing the clinical epidemiology of these diseases have begun to be achieved in recent years, but the evidence base guiding therapy still is limited. Conduct of the Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Eye Diseases (SITE) Cohort Study was a major step toward understanding uveitis and its treatments better. In the process of assembling a database to assess the risks of death and cancer in association with the immunosuppressive drugs used commonly in the management of ocular inflammation, our research group assembled a rich database (17,907 distinct patients followed over 169,194 visits) providing a valuable resource to characterize the clinical epidemiology of ocular inflammatory disease. Our team's efforts in assessing the clinical epidemiology of uveitis and ocular inflammation already has provided a major part of the available evidence-based guidance to patients and clinicians. In this proposal, following up on our work regarding remission of intermediate uveitis and primary anterior uveitis, we will study remission in cases of chronic anterior uveitis, scleritis, and the cicatrizing conjunctivitis of mucous membrane pemphigoid. Remission is the ideal goal of clinical management, but little information presently is available regarding this outcome to guide clinical decision-making. In addition, cataract is a major cause of visual loss in ocular inflammatory diseases, and while cataract surgery often is effective, the relatively young patients affected lose accommodation for the rest of their lives. In a manner similar to our past work on the risk of intraocular pressure elevation, we will estimate the risk of cataract causing reduction in visual acuity to worse than 20/40 (as well as cataract surgery for confirmatory purposes). For each outcome, we will evaluate modifiable and unmodifiable risk factors, addressing questions such as whether there is a dose beyond which topical corticosteroids induce a high risk of cataract, and whether statins increase remission of uveitis. A predictive ?points? model will be generated to predict the incidence of remission or of cataract under alternative scenarios for anterior uveitis (the most common form of uveitis). These objectives are responsive to the Strategic Plan and goals of the National Eye Institute, to support applied clinical research concerning blinding eye diseases and preservation of sight, especially the goal ?Establish the causes and etiology of uveitis and improve methods for its diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.?"

"9462148","Fear- and anxiety-driven behaviors result from interactions in a distributed network of functionally specialized areas of the cortex in which the amygdala plays an essential role by connecting sensory stimuli with their emotional meaning. To avoid detection, mice freeze in place when a looming visual stimulus mimics an approaching object. Alternatively, when detected by a predator the best option for survival may be to escape guided by a cognitive spatial map. Spatial maps are derived from landmark- and path integration-signals accumulated in the cortex from object features and optic flow patterns while navigating through the environment. The cortical network by which this is achieved involves inputs from the visual `where' and `what' streams to the postrhinal area (POR)66 of the parahippocampal cortex, whose output flows through the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus. Our findings in mice show that POR is the only visual area with strong reciprocal connections with the amygdala, suggesting that POR processes information about emotionally salient objects and guides stimulus-appropriate actions. In direct support for this notion, we have found that POR carries shape, object-motion and self-motion signals. Our results further show that POR contains type 2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2)-positive and M2-negative modules of which only the M2-negative interpatches receive input from the amygdala. This suggests that interpatches, which in V1 are packed with motion selective cells33, are preferentially tuned by affective inputs from the amygdala. To test this hypothesis we propose to determine the connectional network between POR and the amygdala. Further, we propose to use single unit recordings in POR in awake head-fixed mice, and optogenetic manipulations of inputs from the amygdala, to examine whether the gain of responses to dynamically changing cues and static object features in M2-positive and M2-negative modules is differentially modulated. We expect to find that the amygdala selectively influences responses to object-motion in M2-negative interpatches rather than responses to shape-features represented in M2-postivite patches. If the expectations are confirmed, we will conclude that the amygdala selectively increases the saliency of coherently moving object elements, improves their recognition and optimizes the route13 of escape from of a predator pouncing from a hideout."
"9467563","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular O2 sensing is an important biological process in health and disease. The ability to detect and respond to hypoxia is required for embryonic development, for transition from placental to lung respiration at birth, and for systemic oxygen homeostasis throughout life. In previous funding cycles we discovered that mitochondria regulate the signaling of hypoxia to the cell through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from complex III, which then activate cellular protective and adaptive responses. We also developed genetic tools for assessing subcellular redox signaling and for modifying ROS generation from complex III. Inhibition of hypoxia-induced mitochondrial ROS signals by genetic deletion of the Risked Iron-Sulfur Protein (RISP) or expression of an H2O2 scavenger in the mitochondrial intermembrane space abrogated hypoxia responses in diverse cell types. Unexpectedly, deletion of RISP in the adult mouse heart induced profound remodeling characterized by a ~2.5-fold increase in heart weight and thickening of the ventricular walls, with no evidence of cellular hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte diameter, cell morphology, and mitochondrial ultrastructure were unchanged, while immunostaining for markers of cellular proliferation (Ki67) revealed profuse distributions of labeled cells, consistent with the generatio of new cardiomyocytes. Gene array analysis during remodeling identified activation of pathways involving cytoskeletal reorganization but no signature characteristic of cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesize that ROS signals are generated by cardiac mitochondria in response to the decrease in myocardial PO2 that occurs as the neonatal heart transitions from a fetal glycolytic program into the adult oxidative phenotype. We postulate that these ROS signals trigger the cell cycle arrest that develops by postnatal day 7. Deletion of RISP, which is required for hypoxia-induced ROS signaling, abrogates the ROS signaling and permits adult cardiomyocytes to re-enter the cell cycle. We will test these hypotheses using genetic models to manipulate mitochondrial ROS generation and signaling, identify early genes involved in the activation of this response, and determine the cellular mechanisms underlying the regulation of proliferative arrest by heart mitochondria. Finally, we will test whether reactivation of proliferation in hearts damaged by ischemia-reperfusion can be induced by modulating complex III function, allowing rescue of function through the generation of new cardiomyocytes. The results of these studies could provide a major advance in our understanding of how cell proliferation in the heart is controlled, and carry profound potential clinical significance in terms of the treatment of ischemi injury in the heart."
"9537563","PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall Center: Maier, Lantz)  The University of Arizona Superfund Research Program (UA SRP) is investigating the human and environmental risks associated with metal mining. A majority of metal mining takes place in the Western United States and other arid and semi-arid parts of the world. A central challenge for arid environments is that human exposure routes and the fate and cleanup of mining contamination are different than for areas that receive more rainfall. This has led to a large knowledge gap in regard to health and environmental effects of mine waste systems. Our Center will address two major issues within this overall gap. The first is the lack of understanding of mining waste behavior and containment and the relative impacts of airborne and waterborne spread of mine waste into arid environments. Mine wastes, in particular legacy mine tailings, generate dust- borne toxic metals (for example, arsenic and lead). These wastes also generate acid mine drainage, resulting in contamination of groundwater which is often the primary potable water source for surrounding communities. The second knowledge gap is a lack of understanding of the human health consequences of inhalation of mine dusts, specifically regarding the development of chronic lung diseases. The UA SRP has an unparalleled group of scientists to address these knowledge gaps. The three UA SRP environmental projects are focused on developing new technologies for site cleanup and on characterizing surface (dust) and subsurface (water) transport and fate of metals associated with mining waste both before and after cleanup. The two biomedical projects center around defining the importance of inhalation exposures and health impacts of metal toxicants in mine wastes, focusing on arsenic and its effects on lung disease. Results will be used to build conceptual and quantitative models to describe mechanisms of metal toxicity and movement from waste areas into neighboring communities or ecosystems. Together, our environmental and biomedical researchers will use these models to: 1) develop exposure assessment tools that can be used to evaluate the risk for communities that neighbor mine waste or smelter sites; 2) evaluate the effectiveness of new surface and subsurface cleanup technologies; and 3) provide critical information on how arsenic, one of the most prevalent toxicants in mine waste, exerts its effects. Project teams work seamlessly with Research Translation, Community Engagement, and Training Cores to support the dynamic translation of this research to communities adjacent to Superfund sites, federal (EPA, ATSDR) and state (AZ Dept. Environmental Quality, AZ Dept. Health Services) stakeholders, and the mining industry. To further its impact, the UA SRP will continue to develop complementary initiatives, such as the Center for Environmentally Sustainable Mining, an industry-academic cooperative to move research results into the field in real time. The principle guiding the UA SRP is that its research should be innovative in advancing individual scientific fields. More importantly, it should transform industry-wide practices in mining to improve environment/ecosystem preservation and protect human health."
"9504767","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF."
"9450449","This project will determine the effect of aging on alveolar macrophages (AMs) and their interaction with M.tb.  We will address how alterations in AM biology during aging impact the increased risk of the elderly to airborne  infection, a greatly underexplored area. AMs are classified as alternatively activated macrophages or, more  generally, immunoregulatory macrophages that enable clearance of aerosolized particulates while maintaining  optimal gas exchange. The studies herein are based on the emerging concept that with aging chronic low-  grade inflammation (inflammaging) occurs in the lung which alters AM phenotype and function. Our central  hypothesis is that chronic lung inflammation during aging is associated with a unique inflammatory signature  which paradoxically leads to early control of M.tb in AMs, while setting the stage for subsequent enhanced  growth and bacterial dissemination. We put forth the novel hypothesis that this occurs through uncontrolled  activation of a specific macrophage immunoregulatory network resulting in enhanced cellular immigration to  the lungs, AM activation and pathology. The consequences of the different inflammatory sequences in the  young vs. old is that in the young, the immunoregulatory signature results in establishment of latency with  stable granulomas containing fewer M.tb and immune cells. In contrast, in the elderly the long-term effects of  the chronic inflammation are establishment of latency with unstable granulomas containing more M.tb and  activated immune cells that drive reactivation. We have developed a new three stage model to be explored in 3  specific aims: 1) Define age-related phenotype and immune function of AMs (Stage 1). Expression of specific  receptors, inflammatory modulators and oxidants will be compared in adult/elderly human and young/old  mouse AMs. We will define the initial signaling pathways that regulate cytokine production and determine if old  age increases recruitment and retention of activated AMs in the lung. 2) Determine AM uptake and control of  M.tb in old age while initiating an aberrant inflammatory signaling network (Stages 2 and 3). We will compare  phagocytosis, oxidative responses, trafficking and intracellular growth of M.tb in AMs in old vs. young age. We  will also characterize an alternative NF-??1-mediated signaling pathway in AMs from the elderly which, during  M.tb infection, leads to increased IL-10, and activation of an IFN-?/? autocrine feedback loop that sustains IL-  10 and CCL2 production. 3) Define the impact of the AM aberrant inflammatory signaling network during the  course of infection in old mice, including reactivation (Stage 3). We will determine activity of the aberrant  signaling network during the course of in vivo infection of old mice. We will also assess the importance of  specific signaling network components on enhanced M.tb growth in old mice using blockers. The project fully  integrates with and informs the other projects and cores. The proposed studies are innovative in that they  provide the first comprehensive, model-driven, comparative and mechanistic analyses of the effects of aging  on human and mouse AM function in old age."
"9474831","SUMMARY ? PROJECT 1 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive, incurable tumor. SCLC phenotypic heterogeneity has been associated with disease aggressiveness, yet there have been no clinical advances based on patient tumor stratification, and the uniform standard-of-care, based on combination chemo-radiation therapy unchanged for over half a century, remains largely ineffective. Recently, several groups including ourselves have independently identified phenotypic cell subpopulations in SCLC across a variety of experimental systems including human cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and primary tumors, as well as tumors from SCLC genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Yet, there is no global understanding of SCLC phenotypic diversity across systems that could enable integration of findings, leverage GEMMs for translational purposes, and produce insights into its impact on treatment evasion. In this Project, we propose to address this challenge by developing a global blueprint of SCLC phenotypic space, clarifying the bias imposed to this space by genomic alterations, and understanding phenotype transition or selection dynamics in response to drugs. In Aim 1 we develop a workflow to infer SCLC phenotypic heterogeneity from bulk-level transcriptomics data, which we then validate experimentally at the single-cell level. We define a gene ontology metric to identify biological similarities and differences between phenotypes across model systems. The resulting phenotype map will inform studies aimed at connecting model systems to patients. In Aim 2, we propose to link the SCLC phenotypic heterogeneity space to genomic alterations, by statistical correlations validated with experiments that mechanistically induce cells to switch phenotypes through gene manipulation. Since in the clinic SCLC biopsies or surgery are rarely performed beyond initial diagnosis, we then propose liquid biopsies of circulating, cell-free DNA as a clinical proxy for the primary tumor, allowing a connection between these genomic alterations and phenotypic diversity of SCLC tumors. By bridging this gap, predictions about patient response to specific treatments could eventually be made. In Aim 3, we investigate the relative role of transitions vs. selection in supporting SCLC phenotypic plasticity and drug treatment evasion. To this end, we use DNA barcoding and information theory techniques to quantify rates of diversification of SCLC phenotypes in response to drug treatment. Specifically, we map trajectories of cells within the SCLC phenotype space as cells adapt and evade treatment. In summary, we propose to develop a comprehensive view of SCLC phenotypic heterogeneity, linking transcriptomic, genomic, and functional features of SCLC cells across diverse experimental model systems and patient primary tumor specimens. We will link these observations to clinically measurable variables, and develop a unified map of phenotypic response dynamics in response to therapy, providing possible novel avenues to SCLC treatment strategies."
"9462796","Project 3: The Role of ApoE in Neuroplasticity and A? Clearance using iPS Cell-Derived Astrocytes Project Summary/Abstract This proposal aims to utilize patient iPS cell-derived astrocytes to investigate the role of apolipoprotein E (apoE) on AD risk at the molecular level. While mouse models have greatly improved our understanding of AD pathogenesis, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which apoE influences human neuronal function and degeneration remain largely unknown. ADRC patient-derived astrocyte will be used to determine how APOE genotype affects astrocyte function and using a novel human astrocyte/neuronal co-culture, determine the role of apoE isoforms on synapse formation/plasticity and to investigate how synaptic vulnerability to A? and tau is influenced. Recent studies suggest that apoE may also influence astrocyte-mediated A? clearance. We will therefore determine whether the different apoE isoforms alter the rate of A? phagocytosis by human astrocytes and influence the neuron-neuron transmission of tau. The proposed studies will utilize 12 lines of patient- derived iPS cells provided by the ADRC iPS Cell Core (6-APOE ?3/?3 and 6-APOE ?4/?4). In collaboration with the iPS Cell Core, we will also use CRISPR-mediated genome editing to convert an APOE ?4/?4 iPS cell line into an isogenic APOE ?3/?3 line to allow us to compare genetically homogenous human astrocytes that differs only by the APOE allele. Lastly, iPS cell-derived astrocytes will be transplanted into xenotransplantation- compatible Rag-5xfAD and Rag-tau mice to examine the effects of apoE on amyloid and tau pathology in vivo."

"9459737","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to >350,000 deaths annually globally, and is the most common etiology leading to liver transplantation in the U.S. An estimated 174,000 veterans have HCV infection, and the VA is the largest provider of HCV care. Although there are new and exciting HCV treatments, due to resistance and access issues, therapy is not likely to eradicate HCV infection completely. Thus, a vaccine is needed. In addition, people with HCV infection may continue to develop hepatocellular carcinoma. In persistent HCV infection, proliferation and activation of virus-specific T cells is delayed and inefficient, and immune responses to HBV vaccination and bacterial and schistosomal infections are repressed. This suggests that HCV infection suppresses T cell function, although the mechanism for this is unknown. Recent data showed that HCV RNA is released from hepatocytes in infectious exosomes that can transfer HCV RNA to T cells. Since HCV does not replicate in T cells, it is unclear why viral RNA is transferred to these cells. We found that HCV genomic RNA is processed into a viral short RNA sequence (vsRNA) that reduces expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase type E (PTPRE). PTPRE knockdown inhibits phosphorylation and activation of the lymphocyte-specific Src kinase (LCK). Mutating the HCV vsRNA sequence restored LCK phosphorylation and subsequent TCR stimulation. Targeting HCV RNA to a different T cell receptor (CXCR4) restored TCR signaling and PTPRE protein expression, but reduced expression of CXCR4. Thus, HCV appears to exploit the cellular microRNA machinery to process its genome into vsRNAs that reduce PTPRE expression and inhibit TCR-mediated signaling. Based on our recent studies, we hypothesize that, in lymphocytes and hepatocytes, HCV vsRNAs target expression of multiple genes that influence T cell function and viral replication, and thus offer new insights into immune evasion, potential targets for antiviral therapies, and (since they block T-cell responsiveness) better vaccine strategies. Since major knowledge gaps remain concerning HCV vsRNAs we explore key questions in three specific aims. First, we will characterize HCV RNA structures that target PTPRE and examine cellular factors that mediate vsRNA biogenesis. We hypothesize that HCV vsRNA uses non-canonical miRNA mechanisms to generate the vsRNA. Secondly, we will characterize the mechanism(s) by which HCV vsRNAs are delivered to T cells, potentially identifying novel therapeutic targets. We hypothesize that transfer may involve exosomes released into plasma by infected hepatocytes. Finally, we will demonstrate the relevance of the HCV vsRNA we previously identified in human HCV infection. Our preliminary data show that PTPRE and TCR signaling are reduced during HCV infection, and restored following curative therapy. The level of PTPRE reduction correlated directly with the HCV vsRNA sequence. The higher the percent complementarity with the PTPRE 3'UTR present in the patient's isolate, the greater the reduction in PTPRE expression. In the proposal we should show that HCV vs-RNA regulates T cell and likely hepatocyte function in vivo. This information will be critical for understanding the pathogenesis of HCV and highlight a novel mechanism that could be targeted for the treatment and prevention of this global viral pathogen, and potentially numerous other pathogens."
"9501716","Abstract Chemotherapy is the major treatment option for cancer patients. However, systemic toxicity from these drugs can significantly impact patient's quality of life and overall survival. Prevention and effective management of side effects of chemotherapy drugs represents a significant bottleneck in oncology today. Many drugs in Phase I trials have been abandoned and many patients have been denied hope from promising treatment regimens because of the associated adverse systemic side effects (4). Furthermore, toxicity from FDA-approved drugs, like interleukin-2, have prevented their use despite having efficacy. To address these limitations of chemotherapy, we propose a transformative technology where the chemotherapy drug is intra-arterially infused from a drug- eluting stent (DES) and captured along the venous outflow of the tumor using an intravascular drug-capturing device (DCD). We believe that by using the DES/DCD pair system, the tumor site will receive highly localized chemotherapy while systemic presence of the excessive drug molecules will be minimized or eliminated (Fig. 1). This strategy can be applied to many cancers, i.e., internal iliac vein/artery for pelvic tumors, bronchial artery/pulmonary vein for lung cancers, internal mammary vein/artery for breast cancer. In this proposal, we will focus on liver cancer because of our liver angiography experience, the liver has a dual blood supply, liver vasculature is large enough to accommodate stent placements and lower cost of imaging, experimentation and maintaining rabbits. As proof of principle, we will use liver cancer as a model to demonstrate the efficacy of this novel strategy, by delivering DNA-targeting anti-cancer drug doxorubicin, which naturally fluoresces at 480 nm allowing easy detection and quantification. Our preliminary data demonstrates exciting results showing our capability in fabrication of anti-thrombotic biomaterials that can selectively release and capture drug molecules. In addition, we have rich experience in catheter-based delivery of biomaterials for a number of in vivo applications, which will ensure successful completion of the proposed project. First we will develop the DES (Aim 1), then develop the DCD (Aim 2) and finally test the drug release and capture concept in rat and rabbit animal models (Aim 3). Successful development of such a system will represent a paradigm shift in the oncology community by improving patient's quality of life, potentially prolonging survival, resurrecting failed Phase I trials from drug toxicity, increasing the use of FDA-approved previously toxic drugs, and opening up new clinical trials to test much higher doses. The proposed idea of drug release and capture represents a platform technology and may have unparalleled impact in other diseases. For example, the system can be designed to isolate exposure to thrombolytic therapy or immunosuppressants."
"9537570","ABSTRACT (Community Engagement Core: Chief, Field, Maier, Moreno Ramrez) The UA Superfund Research Program (UA SRP) is focused on the health and environmental impacts of metal mining. The interface between mining and public health is one with urgent need of innovative solutions at the community level. The UA SRP's Community Engagement Core (CEC) has developed extensive experience working with communities throughout Arizona and Northern Mexico. In this renewal, we will continue our successful work with Hispanic stakeholders and expand our efforts to include Native American communities that are impacted by mining. The CEC will work to deliver community-engaged science-based information to affected community stakeholders so they can become active players in understanding and making informed decisions on health issues related to mining. The CEC will provide a platform for community stakeholders to influence and potentially participate in the science that the UA SRP is conducting to maintain the relevance of the research to the community concerns. An evaluation component has also been woven throughout our activities to allow quantitative and qualitative measurements of success and lessons-learned to optimize the usefulness of our work. The CEC fills an existing gap in Hispanic and Native American participation in mining issues that impact their communities. Our partners in this effort will include local communities, government agencies, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and the mining industry. The objectives of UA SRP's CEC are to: 1) Engage Native American groups and Mexican communities in health and environmental research related to mining, which includes incorporating them in the design and implementation of projects as well as development of innovative mitigation strategies to decrease risks identified; 2) Build stakeholder capacity: a) by implementing state-wide environmental health training as well as evaluation metrics targeting Hispanic community health workers (promotoras de salud) and Native American community health representatives; b) work with Tribal Community Colleges to create and implement educational modules focused on the mining process and its social and environmental impacts to supplement existing STEM curricula and build a cadre of STEM focused higher education students; 3) Involve impacted individuals and groups living adjacent to Superfund and other contaminated sites in Arizona through multilingual/cultural workshops, specialized meetings, informational brochures, and cutting-edge communication tools. These tools will incorporate quantitative and qualitative mechanisms to assess efficacy and; 4) Assist in the outreach and administration of two centers initiated by the UA SRP, the Dean Carter Binational Center for Environmental Health Sciences and the Center for Environmentally Sustainable Mining both of which have components of community training and outreach on issues related to environmentally and socially-responsible mining.

"9447231","PI: Hamid, Rizwan, MD, Ph.D. Role of bone marrow cells in pathogenesis and therapy of heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term objective of this project is to devise better treatment options for autosomal dominant Heritable Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (HPAH), a rare genetic disorder of lungs. HPAH is a lethal disorder without effective treatment options. The predominant cause of HPAH is mutations in BMPR2 gene. HPAH is a progressive, fatal disease characterized by small pulmonary arterial remodeling involving vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells, which obliterate the vascular lumen. These remodeled vessels are always surrounded by large numbers of bone marrow-derived cells (BMC) however, we do not fully understand the exact role of these cells in HPAH pathogenesis. We have recently shown that transplant of Bmpr2 mutant BMCs caused PAH in control (Ctrl) mice and transplant of Ctrl BMC in Bmpr2 mutant mice resulted in attenuation of PAH. These data indicate that counter to what was previously thought, BMCs may have a causal role in PAH. However we do not know the key cell type in the total BM population that is important, we do not know mechanistically how the lineage-committed BMC in the lungs contribute to HPAH and further more and importantly the extent of the therapeutic potential of these cells in reversing the HPAH lung phenotype. We hypothesize that specific mutant BMC populations cause HPAH, and specific WT BMCs play a role in disease attenuation and recovery. We propose to explore these hypotheses in 3 specific aims. 1) Test the hypothesis that specific BMC populations have a causal role in HPAH. 2) Investigate the hypothesis that BM cell transplantation can prevent or reverse established HPAH. 3) Determine the mechanism by which lineage committed BMC populations contribute to the pathogenesis of HPAH. Our proposal sits at the intersection of lung biology and BMC biology and is a collaborative effort between lung biologists, stem-cell biologists, and clinicians and will produce a synergistic effect that is not easily matched by a single investigator. The rationale for the proposed research is that better understanding of the role of BMCs in HPAH will lead to not only significantly improved insight into disease pathogenesis but also whether BMCs are a useful therapeutic option?an important point considering that effective long-term treatment options for HPAH are severely limited. While this proposal is translational in scope it also presents an innovative paradigm that integrates stem cell biology with lung biology. It is our expectation that we will: 1) develop a better understanding of the role of BMC in HPAH; 2) determine the full therapeutic potential of BMCs in HPAH."
"9475085","Project 3 Abstract  Cancer is an evolutionary process where a single cell grows into a visible tumor after it has acquired multiple driver alterations and has created, or finds itself within, a permissive microenvironment. We will study fundamental parameters of evolution (mutation, drift, selection, MDS), and microenvironmental features to better understand their roles in colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes. The innovation is that MDS-based microenvironmental-aware biomarkers are direct measures of evolution. Such evolution-based biomarkers reflect fundamental mechanisms for understanding what aspects of evolution most impact survival. To fully characterize tumor evolution it is necessary to measure both how tumor cells evolve and the host ecology.  In Aim 1, mutations detected by whole genome sequencing of 4 regions of 200 stage II and III CRCs with long-term follow-up will be classified as public (clonal) and private (subclonal). CRCs will then be subclassified with newly developed algorithms that can quantify selection (positive, neutral, negative) based on subclonal mutation frequencies, where selection preferentially increases (positive) or decreases (negative) subclonal mutation frequency. The same studies will be performed on small numbers of mouse and elephant tumors to test whether neoplastic MDS parameters differ between species. In Aim 2, we will scan microscope sections from the exact same regions sequenced in Aim 1, using a unique automated computational image analysis platformthat can identify cells and quantify tumor microenvironments with respect to lymphocytes and stromal cells. In particular, we will quantify potential immunoediting by the host, using lymphocyte colocalization (Morisita index), lymphocyte density and Immunoscore, because prior studies indicate such host responses lead to significantly better outcomes. To determine if host ecological heterogeneity reflects responses to specific tumor subclones, we will overlay private mutation distributions on the same microscope slides. A correlation between a specific subclone with a specific microenvironment is consistent with selection. No correlation between specific ecological niches and tumor subclones is more consistent with neutral evolution, where all subclones are equally well-adapted and subject to the same selection. We will combine tumor evolution and the host reaction into a single evolution-ecology (Evo-Eco) index that summarizes the underlying evolutionary struggle. For example, patients with aggressive tumors (positive selection) and supportive environments are likely to have poorer outcomes relative to patients with tumorsunder negative selection and repressive environments. We will validate any promising Evo-Eco index on a validation cohort of ~100 more CRCs in Aim 3. Data from this Project will be also analyzed in Project 1, and compared with the normal crypts in Project 2 to determine if and how MDS parameters change in neoplasia. If successful, these studies will advance the measurement and understanding of MDS parameters in human cancer, and could yield improved CRC predictive biomarkers."
"9475084","Abstract: Somatic Cell Evolution in Small Human Replicative Units  This Project studies fundamental parameters of evolution (mutation, drift, and selection MDS) in normal human and animal cells. Although MDS underlies somatic cell evolution, very little is understood about these parameters because they are difficult to study in humans. We will translate methods from evolutionary biology into systems biology. We will study MDS in distinct, small replicative units (intestinal crypts). The compartmentalization of cells into small replicative units can modify evolution because selection and drift (random cell turnover) is limited to immediately adjacent cells. The advantages of analyzing small replicative units are that experimentally they large enough to measure with conventional methods yet small enough to simulate in detail. Characterizing somatic cell evolution in replicative units can lead to better understanding of tumor evolution because selection or drift occurs between neighboring cells.  We will better characterize MDS in crypts based on our existing published (Shibata, Graham) human crypt simulations. These simulations have already inferred stem cell numbers and dynamics based on smaller amounts of data. The new sequencing data are a richer resource because more MDS parameters are encoded by mutations (mutation rates and mechanisms, dN/dS, passenger versus driver, neoantigen accumulation). The sequencing data is augmented by crypt epigenetic and expression data to more fully characterize normal somatic cell evolution. We will sample 8 colon and small intestinal crypts from 40 different aged individuals. For each crypt, we will measure mutations (whole genome sequencing), epigenetic alterations (ATAC-seq), and expression (NanoString). We will also measure APC+/- crypts to determine whether somatic cell evolution changes after a gatekeeper mutation. We will also measure crypt somatic cell evolution in mouse and elephant crypts to determine if their evolution differs.  We will also determine the DNA damage and stress response in fibroblasts from 57 different mammalian species. We will determine de novo mutation rates across the same 57 mammalian cell lines through expansion of single fibroblast cells followed by deep sequencing. We will correlate mutation rates with cancer rates in the same mammalian species as determined in Project 1. Finally, using prioritized candidate gene lists generated in Project 1, we will perform gene editing experiments on the top 5 genes from different species most likely to contribute to their evolution of cancer resistance.  The significance of these studies is a better characterization of basic MDS evolution parameters. The species studies will provide perspective on whether MDS parameters are fixed or can vary with age or species, identifying which parameters are more amenable for intervention. A complete systems biology solution of normal human crypts will facilitate further efforts with much larger groups of somatic cells. This Project will lay the groundwork for future work to impact patient care through evolutionary-based solutions to cancer."
"9474832","PROJECT SUMMARY ? PROJECT 2  Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine subtype of lung cancer. SCLC patients have a very low 5-year survival, in large part because SCLC tumors can become rapidly resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy and because of a lack of targeted therapies. Emerging evidence supports the idea that, while SCLC tumors seem homogeneous when examined under a microscope, these tumors contain a significant level of intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Indeed, recent observations by our group and others have identified distinct cellular phenotypes in SCLC, including in primary human tumors, in cell lines derived from human tumors, and in tumors from genetically-engineered mouse models. Importantly, data from our group as well as from Project 1 investigators indicate that these cellular phenotypes contribute to SCLC development and potentially response to therapy. The specific goal of this proposal is to elucidate how different cellular subpopulations within SCLC tumors drive SCLC dynamics, growth, survival, and aggressiveness as an ecosystem. To accomplish this goal, we will focus on better understanding the nature of SCLC phenotypic subtypes and how these populations functionally interact with each other and with noncancerous cells in the tumor microenvironment.  Specifically, we have previously identified stem-like tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) in SCLC tumors and found that these cells are neuroendocrine and strongly tumorigenic. We have also characterized cell populations derived from these TPCs with distinct phenotypes, including non-neuroendocrine subpopulations that can promote the growth and the spread of the neuroendocrine TPCs. Leveraging these findings as well as our unique genetic mouse models that allow dissection of SCLC phenotype evolution, we will use a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches to investigate how these different SCLC cell types contribute to tumor growth, in relationship with the tumor microenvironment. We will build and use mathematical modeling to predict key interactions between SCLC subpopulations with distinct phenotypes and to uncover fragility/intervention points that could be used for treatment. Modeling will also be a key factor driving experimental design. As part of this design, we will determine how cell-cell interactions in SCLC tumors affect the division and survival rates of the different subpopulations; we will also determine phenotype transition rates between different subpopulations to capture SCLC dynamics and plasticity. Finally, we will elucidate the role of secretory factors released by these SCLC subpopulations in driving survival, growth, phenotype composition, and metastasis of SCLC tumors. These experiments will elucidate basic mechanisms of SCLC development and progression and may ultimately lead to novel therapeutic approaches by identifying key interactions of SCLC subpopulations."

"9457462","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients suffering from ocular injury and inflammation are at risk for development of chronic uncontrolled immune activation and tissue injury. Many of these conditions are commonly treated with non-specific anti- inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids, which non-discriminately suppress host immunity, including both pathogenic and regulatory cells of the immune system. There is thus a pressing need for developing more effective and safe immunomodulatory strategies which not only downregulate specific pathogenic immune cells, but importantly also promote regulatory immune cells, namely myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Interestingly, non-hematopoietic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) have shown significant immunomodulatory promise. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that BM- MSC can indeed promote MDSC and Treg function, and can be used to reestablish immune quiescence in ocular inflammation. However, very little is known regarding the mechanisms by which BM-MSC promote the function of these immunoregulatory cells. We specifically hypothesize that BM-MSC (i) skew differentiation of immature myeloid progenitor cells toward MDSC and away from macrophages; and (ii) provide direct support for Treg function via both cell-to-cell contact and paracrine mechanisms. To validate these hypotheses, we propose to pursue two specific aims: In Aim 1, we will define the mechanisms by which BM-MSC promote generation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and control ocular inflammation. We will specifically investigate i) which functional subset of MDSC is promoted by BM-MSC; and ii) determine BM-MSC-expressed factors that promote MDSC generation. In Aim 2 we plan to determine the mechanisms by which BM-MSC directly enhance regulatory T cell function. In particular, we will investigate i) how BM-MSC-secreted hepatocyte growth factor promotes Treg function; and ii) the BMMSC cell surface-expressed molecules that promote Treg function through cell-cell interactions. The methodology we propose has been designed to utilize our laboratory's expertise in immunological assays along with a well-characterized murine cornea model of transplant-induced ocular inflammation and immunity. We anticipate that delineation of the mechanisms by which BM-MSC control ocular inflammation will identify critical immunomodulatory factors which can be utilized to develop new therapeutic strategies. The overall impact of this research will be significant, given the high prevalence of ocular inflammatory disorders and the potential benefit of therapeutic strategies that promote immunoregulatory cells while also inhibiting pathogenic immune cells."
"9458783","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regulatory mechanisms responsible for limiting thrombus development are critical for maintaining normal hemostasis. New findings showing that TFPI? binds coagulation factor V(a) and inhibits prothrombinase assembly highlights that out understanding of the initiation of coagulation is evolving. Work from my laboratory has laid the groundwork for deciphering the mechanistic bases that may underpin how TFPI? mediates these anticoagulant effects. We hypothesize that through molecular mimicry, TFPI? uses key structural regions of the FV B-domain that remain following partial cleavage of the procofactor during the early phases of thrombus development. These include basic (BR) and acidic (AR) regions that are key auto-inhibitory elements responsible for keeping FV in an inactive procofactor state. The objectives of this proposal are to decipher these molecular processes, examine how they influence FV(a) activation and function, provide evidence its biologically relevant and identify which pool of FV (plasma or platelet-derived) contributes to these effects. A further goal is to better understand the molecular bases by which TFPI? modulate naturally occurring forms of FV including FV-East Texas and FV-Amsterdam, recently identified spliced forms of FV found in plasma that are missing a large portion of the B-domain. These new angles of thinking about FV activation, its biology, and regulation opens up several unexplored lines of experimentation. In the first aim, we will characterize the structural/functional determinants that maintain the FV procofactor state and determine whether TFPI? employs these molecular surfaces to dampen cofactor function. New biochemical and structural approaches (via collaborations) will be pursued to provide detailed insight into these molecular interactions. In the second aim, we will investigate the biochemical properties of naturally occurring forms of FV that lack the BR and characterize their interaction with TFPI?. We hypothesize that TFPI? utilizes a different set of structural determinants to bind different forms of FV(a) and the comple mediates its anticoagulant effects through multiple mechanisms. In the last aim, we will address the physiologic relevance of the FVAR-TFPI? interaction, determine how it may regulate thrombus development in vivo, and investigate whether this is mediated by plasma and/or platelet forms of FV. We hypothesize partially cleaved forms of FV are abundant at the site of the developing thrombus and that they are targets for TFPI?. We speculate that disruption of this regulatory mechanism results in altered kinetics of thrombus growth. We will test these innovative ideas using biochemical, kinetic, biophysical, structural and in vivo approaches employing a host of custom FV reagents. Knowledge gained from this proposal will move the field forward by providing an exceptional level of molecular detail on the structural and functiona regulation of FV released at the site of vascular injury. Because FV/Va has such a profound impact on thrombin generation, studies in this application will have important implications in developing new ways to modulate hemostasis to control bleeding or limit thrombosis."

"9543086","Fibrosis is the histological manifestation of chronic kidney disease (CKD). While the kidney can fully regenerate and repair following acute kidney injury (AKI), injury response can also follow a maladapative path in fibrosis resulting in epithelial atrophy, accumulation of myofibroblasts, collagen and inflammatory cells. A key bottleneck to progress in our understanding of regeneration and differentiation has been the limited insight into cell-specific genome wide gene expression changes. A revolution in cellular measurement technology is under way. For the first time, we have the ability to monitor genome-wide gene regulation in thousands of individual cells in a single experiment, using single cell ?omic? studies. Such experiments allow us to discover new cell types and states, trace the origin of cells and identify underlying cell- specific gene expression changes therefore, this method shall enable us to understand reparative and maladaptive regeneration in fibrosis. The primary goal of this proposal is to explore the hypothesis that the Notch pathway plays an important role in the development of chronic kidney disease and kidney fibrosis."
"9481831","Dose Reduction in Pediatric Molecular Imaging Project Summary The radiation exposure resulting from medical imaging has become a public safety concern. Nuclear medicine imaging provides potentially life-saving information regarding physiological processes. Such imaging is particularly valuable in children and infants wherein the rapid and unequivocal diagnosis of developmental or pathological concerns is essential for the health of these patients. Our overall objective is to reduce pediatric patient absorbed dose while maintaining and even improving the diagnostic quality of nuclear medicine images. Dose reduction for pediatric patients is particularly important since such patients are at increased risk owing to the enhanced radiosensitivity of their tissues and the longer time-period over which stochastic radiation effects may manifest. We will accomplish this overall objective by: 1. Optimizing image acquisition, reconstruction, and processing methods to achieve the best image quality at the lowest possible administered activity; 2. Collecting imaging-based pharmacokinetic data for agents commonly used in pediatric patients; 3. We will develop online tools that compare dose and image quality for patients of different weights and heights at different administered activities with dose and image quality metrics obtained using the current consensus guidelines and; 4., investigate the sensitivity of the results obtained in aims 1 and 3 to changes in instrumentation. Collectively, these aims will substantially impact dosing of pediatric patients for molecular imaging procedures. Aims 1 and 2 will provide the data needed to evaluate whether consensus guidelines lead to dose reduction for all pediatric patients. We already demonstrated in the prior grant period that optimal dose reduction (i.e., reduction that preserves diagnostic image quality) requires an accounting of both patient height and weight. Aim 3 will provide the tools to enable professional organizations to rigorously evaluate and likely refine or provide alternatives to consensus dose guidelines. Any guideline or dose- reduction effort that endeavors to maintain diagnostic image quality will be susceptible to imaging instrumentation variability. In Aim 4, we examine the impact of this variability on both already established consensus guidelines and also on the optimization scheme that we propose to develop via aims 1-3. By using state-of-the-art computational simulation, image quality evaluation, and radiation dosimetry tools (many of which were developed by the investigators), the work proposed in this grant application will apply dose reduction methods in a much more rigorous and scientifically validated manner. We expect that completion of the proposed studies will allow the molecular imaging community to introduce and, consistent with the realities of clinical practice, implement pediatric dose-reduction approaches that substantially improve upon current guidelines and that also point to future technological advances that could yield even greater dose-reduction while simultaneously improving diagnostic image quality."
"9505453","PROJECT SUMMARY Project Summary: This proposal describes a five-year training program that will ultimately develop Dr. Kara Mould into an independent academic basic science investigator. Her long-term career goal is to advance the field of macrophage biology through the elucidation of targets for lung repair and the treatment of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome or inflammatory lung diseases. During this K08 Award, Dr. Mould will gain specific career development training and mentorship closely aligned with an innovative research plan. She proposes to study the affect of arginine metabolism on alveolar macrophage programming in models of acute lung injury. Given its applicability to multiple pulmonary disorders and potential applicability to repair of injury in other organs, this work is directly relevant to the NHLBI. Candidate: Dr. Mould is a board-certified Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine physician at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She is in the final year of fellowship training, having elected to complete an optional year of dedicated research. Her previous record of academic excellence, basic science research, and scientific publications demonstrates a firm commitment to a career as an academic clinician-scientist. Training: The proposed career development plan augments Dr. Mould's prior mentored research during her undergraduate, medical, residency, and fellowship training. She proposes to meet her short-term objectives through an integrated combination of intensive mentoring by internationally renowned experts in macrophage biology and didactic and hands-on experiences in (i) Immunology, (ii) metabolic programming of immune cells (iii) bioinformatics, (iv) scientific writing and presentation, and (v) laboratory leadership. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Mould has established close working relationships with highly experienced mentors and collaborators who contribute expertise in macrophage and lung biology (Drs. Henson and Janssen), metabolomics (Dr. D'Alessandro), bioinformatics (Dr. Fingerlin), human lung and epithelial biology (Dr. Mason), endothelial biology (Dr. Petrache), and career development of clinician-scientists (Drs. Douglas, Eickelberg, and Voelker.) The proposed activities will be based at National Jewish Health with support from the University of Colorado, both renowned respiratory medical centers and world-class research institutions. Research Project: The primary objective of this proposal is to identify the mechanism by which alveolar macrophages are programmed to resolve inflammation and promote repair of the injured lung. Specifically, our study will test the hypothesis that the metabolic enzyme, arginase 1, is a critical checkpoint for both inflammatory and reparative programming of alveolar macrophages. This will be tested using a well- established murine model of lung injury and primary cells isolated from diseased human lungs or non-diseased controls. In doing so, the specific contribution of arginine metabolism to macrophage programming and pathways that regulate recovery from inflammatory lung diseases will be elucidated."
"9295660","SUMMARY. A key inflammatory output of the inflammasome, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1?), is one of the earliest and most important alarms to infection. Preliminary data by the candidate, Dr. Christopher LaRock, shows IL-1?-inhibiting immunotherapies for the treatment of autoinflammatory disease are associated with significantly increased reports of severe infections by group A Streptococcus (GAS). Through invasive infections like necrotizing fasciitis and complications like toxic shock syndrome, glomeruloronephritis, and rheumatic heart disease, GAS is one of the top ten causes of infection related mortality in the world. Yet comparatively mild infections like pharyngitis also make GAS one of the world's most common pathogens. Ultimately, the ability of GAS to invade tissue and cause the most severe diseases is limited by IL-1?; removal of this barrier with therapeutic anti-inflammatories thereby increases the risk of infection by GAS more so than for any other pathogen. While revealing a serious adverse effect that has a poor prognosis if not caught early, this observation also provides fundamental insights into molecular pathogenesis of GAS. That is, hyper-activation of IL-1? occurs independently of the inflammasome. Mechanistically, this occurs because the streptococcal protease SpeB can directly process IL-1? into a mature, signaling-competent form that establishes a hyper-inflammatory state. These findings therefore represent a paradigm where IL-1? and the inflammasome do not necessarily have overlapping functions in immunity. The research directions defined in this K22 proposal examine the biochemical activation of IL-1? by SpeB, the signaling activity that results, and how this inflammation controls GAS in murine models of invasive skin infection and pharyngitis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved gives insight into the pathogenesis of GAS that can lead to new therapeutic strategies, and insight into the inflammation that occurs during infections by several other leading bacterial pathogens. Accomplishing this requires a multi-pronged approach, benefiting from Dr. LaRock's graduate research on the inflammasome, and further developed during his tailored postdoctoral training that integrates animal models of infection, bacteriology of Gram-positive pathogens, and protease biochemistry. This K22 award provides the means to pursue this novel, important research direction and generate the preliminary data to support future junior faculty and R01 grant applications examining the molecular mechanisms of GAS pathogenesis and more broadly, the regulation of IL-1? during other diseases."
"9552697","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Of the challenges that face Parkinson's disease (PD) research, few are more pressing than early detection of preclinical disease. Currently no method exists to diagnose PD before the irreversible deterioration of the brain. The lack of useful biomarkers is also a roadblock for studies of disease-modifying therapies, leading to the strong consensus that a major initiative to develop PD biomarkers is essential. Sense of smell is among the first casualties of PD, with olfactory loss occurring in up to 90% of patients. Furthermore, an association between impaired olfaction and subsequent PD diagnosis has been found in prospective population-based studies, suggesting that olfactory dysfunction is a very early sign of idiopathic PD. Although interest in using olfaction as a biomarker for PD has increased substantially in recent years, the mechanism of olfactory loss and its cause-and-effect relationship to ?-synucleinopathy, a major pathological hallmark of PD, remain unclear. This knowledge gap has created a major roadblock to diagnostic and therapeutic progress. Thus, it is critical that we understand the olfactory system neuroanatomical changes that lead to loss of smell in both the preclinical and symptomatic phases of PD, since an understanding of this pathway in well-defined animal models would significantly impact our knowledge of the mechanisms for loss of dopaminergic neurons, and at the same time provide a means for rapid and objective assessment of disease risk. Our over-arching hypothesis is that olfactory damage in PD is an early event based on specific neuroanatomical changes with measurable functional impact, and is directly linked to upstream ?-synuclein toxicity. We will assess the olfactory system by capitalizing on a well-established murine genetic model of PD, namely ?-synuclein aggregate deposition in mThy1-hSNCA transgenic mice, and emphasizing experiments during the prodromal stage. This model is highly relevant to the etiology of olfactory dysfunction in human PD owing to its construct and face validity with PD in humans. Moreover, we will achieve high-level definition of olfactory system injury by exploiting: i) tagged odorant receptor-expressing transgenic mice (M72- or P2-IRES- tau-LacZ) for precise tracking of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and their stereotypic olfactory sensory map, ii) thy1-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) transgenic mice for analyzing mitral cells, their neural circuitry and archicortical projections, and iii) advanced non-invasive functional neuroimaging (fMRI, MEMRI, and GT-tMRI). By combining these incisive modalities with behavioral, biochemical, and histological assessments, we will elucidate the neuroanatomical substrate for early olfactory loss in PD, while also addressing the role of synucleinopathy in PD-associated olfactory dysfunction. Three aims are proposed: Aim 1 - To understand the role of post-synaptic ?-synuclein toxicity in structural and functional changes in the olfactory sensory neurons and their stereotypic olfactory sensory map leading to impaired sense of smell in PD. Aim 2 - To elucidate how abnormal ?-synuclein aggregates induce structural changes in the olfactory bulb mitral cells, their neural circuitry and modulatory interneurons, leading to impaired sense of smell in PD. Aim 3 - To elucidate how abnormal ?-synuclein aggregates alter archicortical projections and targets of mitral cells leading to impaire odor identification and discrimination in PD. These studies are significant, as the results will enhance understanding of the mechanisms of olfactory loss in PD and its relationship to pathologic ?-synuclein. Our results will in turn provide clues to new therapies, as well as biomarkers useful for early detection, prognostication, and monitoring of either disease progression or outcomes of disease-modifying therapies. Our approaches are innovative, since they exploit incisive genetic and cutting-edge analytic tools, and the study is highly feasible due to the team's expertise in olfaction, PD, neurodegeneration, oxidative stress, neurobehavioral testing, and advanced imaging technologies."
"9475325","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Step asymmetry post-stroke (i.e., limp) substantially affects the quality of life of stroke survivors because it impairs patients' mobility, thereby limiing their daily activities and increasing their dependency on others. Consequently, a primary interest for patients, clinicians, and researchers is to correct the step asymmetry in stroke survivors. Promising studies show that patients can re-learn to walk symmetrically if their step asymmetry is exaggerated with a split-belt treadmill that moves the legs at different speeds. While these results are encouraging, gait improvements are highly contextual and do not persist when walking over ground. To address this critical issue for gait rehabilitation, the PI is proposing a combination of computational and experimental approaches to identify key factors regulating the generalization of locomotor learning after stroke. The PI's central hypothesis is that inherent features from one's movement (e.g., kinematic errors and walking speed) regulate the generalization of locomotor learning. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of the PI's preliminary data showing more generalization of treadmill learning to over ground walking when kinematic errors or walking speed during split-belt adaptation are similar to those naturally experienced. In the proposed computational approach, model inputs are errors that subjects experience during split-belt walking (for example, unexpected leg motions disturbing one's balance), model outputs are actions to correct these errors (for example, a larger step to prevent falling). The mathematical relationship between inputs and outputs is used to predict the effect of error size (Aim 1) and walking speed (Aim 2) on the generalization of learning in an individual basis. Once factors mediating the generalization of learning are identified, they can be harnessed to develop interventions that improve the gait of stroke survivors during real-life situations. PI qualifications: the PI is a prolific and creative bioengineer. Her first class trainng in physics, biomechanics, and neuroscience, in addition to her strong interest in rehabilitation make her the adequate individual for doing the proposed work. Her studies in human motor control are well recognized (>700 citations; h-index 11) in a relatively short, but highly productive academic career. Through this award she will receive mentorship from two extraordinary investigators with complementary expertise: Michael Boninger, MD, PhD. (clinical rehabilitation) and Reza Shadmehr, PhD (computational motor control). They will serve as primary co-mentors. In addition the PI will receive mentorship from an expert panel of collaborators including Dr. Subashan Perera (biostatistics), Dr. Steven Graham (neurology), Dr. Julie Fiez (neuropsychology) and Dr. Skidmore (post-stroke rehabilitation). Thus, this award will provide the mentorship and career development allowing the PI to become an independent researcher able to compete for R01-level funding to study gait deficits post-stroke through computational modeling."
"9512549","Objective: The main goal of this application is to study the mechanism whereby the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) modulates the permeability of the BBB under physiological conditions and after an ischemic stroke. Methods In Aim I we will test the hypothesis that under non-ischemic conditions astrocytic LRP1 preserves the integrity of the basement membrane-astrocyte (BM-A) interface by promoting the recruitment of integrins to the membrane of perivascular astrocytic end- feet processes and their binding to its ligands in the basement membrane (BM). In Aim II we propose that this function is lost under ischemic conditions when the cleavage of the extracellular domain of LRP1 from perivascular astrocytes activates a cell-signaling pathway that increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In Aim III we will study in an animal model of ischemic stroke whether inhibition of LRP1 cleavage from perivascular astrocytes with the receptor-associated protein (RAP) prevents the harmful effects of endogenous tPA and/or rtPA on the permeability of the BBB. Research Plan In the first Aim of this application we will use astrocytic cell cultures and a cell adhesion assay. In the second Aim we will use astrocytic cultures, an in vitro model of the blood- brain barrier, real-time PCR, confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation assays. In the third Aim we will use a nanocarrier that we engineered to selectively deliver its content to the BBB in the ischemic tissue and an animal model of cerebral ischemia. "
"9558327","ABSTRACT Tumor-derived circulating exosomes has been emerging in fundamental cancer research, clinical diagnosis and monitoring of treatment responses. However, the specific preparation of enriched, distinct exosome populations is still challenging. Currently, the most common procedure for purifying exosomes involves a series of high-speed ultracentrifugation steps in order to remove cell debris and pellet exosomes. Commercially available exosome isolation kits still need a benchtop centrifuge before the chemical precipitation of exosomal molecular contents. The isolation protocols are tedious and time-consuming (? 10 h) with relatively low yield and recovery purity (? 25%). In order to substantially improve isolation performance and throughput, Clara Diagnostics Inc. proposes to develop a microfluidic-based isolation platform as a research tool for automated, high-specific and high throughput processing of tumor-exosomes and subtypes from a wide variety of biofluids, in response to NIH PA-17-302 SBIR Phase I Funding Opportunity. Currently, there is no any microfluidic-based exosome isolation platform commercially available, although microfluidic technology has proved unmatched capability for exosome processing and molecular profiling. Clara Diagnostics Inc. aims to fulfill this gap by developing the first microdevice product which enables the automated, high-throughput and continuous processing of 96 samples on demand. The implementation of magnetic anisotropic oscillation in 96-channel microfluidic device enables ultra-fast mixing of beads with biofluids while using high flow rates. The single channel processing speed is ~30 ?L/min with a throughput of 96 channels. Note that conventional ultracentrifugation or differential centrifugation processes total blood plasma volume of ~12 mL in 10 h or 6 samples per run. Our proposed platform can process 96 samples with total processing volume of ~1,728 mL in 10 h, which is ~ 144-fold increase. Together with the high-throughput operation and high-specificity to tumor- exosomes and subtypes, we will deliver a generic, enabling platform for preparing enriched, distinct exosome subpopulations from a wide variety of biofluids, such as blood serum, plasma, urine, saliva, cell culture medium, malignant ascites, and milk. This product as a research tool can process sample volumes from 96 channels in microliter for on-chip analysis to milliliter preparation for variable downstream benchtop measurements and therapeutic applications (e.g., mass spectrometry, PCR, and sequencing, and delivery carrier). In strong contrast to current commercial exosome isolation kits, the proposed microfluidic platform will present a new-generation of product that offers unmatched sample processing capabilities for exosome research and immensely accelerates cancer research and clinical development of liquid-biopsy."

"9462760","Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to assess the bone repair potential of human bone marrow cells transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the cDNA for BMP-2. There are a number of difficult bone repair scenarios for which there is no consistently satisfactory solution including: fracture nonunion, acute fractures with extensive bone loss, revision total joint arthroplasty and pseudarthrosis of the spine. Traditionally, autologous bone graft has been the gold standard but there is a limited supply of this bone and there are concerns regarding the morbidity associated with graft harvest. Recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are FDA approved for use in spinal fusion and treatment of fresh tibial fractures. However, BMPs have had mixed success in humans and are associated with side effects including soft tissue edema and heterotopic ossification. Orthopaedic surgeons have been searching for alternative tissue engineering strategies to enhance bone repair. Our plan is to develop regional gene therapy using transduced bone marrow cells as one aspect of a comprehensive tissue engineering strategy to enhance bone repair. It has been demonstrated in animal models that gene therapy with BMP producing bone marrow cells created via lentiviral gene transfer has the potential to treat either medium or large bone defects or when the biological environment of the host is severely compromised. In this proposal we plan to test our hypothesis that human bone marrow cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to overexpress BMP-2 have the potential to enhance bone repair in humans. Human bone marrow cells will be harvested from the intramedullary canals of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The cells will be transduced with a lentiviral vector (LV-TSTA-iC9/BMP-2) that contains the cDNA for BMP-2 and an inducible suicide gene (iCaspase 9) and then implanted in a critical sized femoral defect model in nude rats. We propose the following aims to accomplish the goal including: 1) compare the efficacy of regional gene therapy after bone repair with freshly isolated or cultured expanded human bone marrow cells; 2) establish a ?cellular dose? of transduced cells that can be scaled up for use in humans; and 3) determine the local and systemic biodistribution of BMP transduced human cells and assess for organ toxicity, vector genotoxicity and heterotopic ossification. The data obtained from this proposal will provide critical information with respect to adapting this regional gene therapy strategy as a treatment regimen in humans."

"9462698","PROJECT 1 PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology can be observed in the brain many years or even decades before the onset of the resulting dementia providing a window of opportunity where intervention may have the greatest chance of success. Observed alterations in this prodromal stage involve multiple distinguishable neural networks in the brain, including the medial temporal and parietal lobe networks. Particularly, increased hippocampal activation observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) appears to contribute to memory dysfunction and may therefore potentially be used as a marker for the early development of AD pathology. However, it remains unclear if this hippocampal sub region specific dysfunction is associated with other fMRI changes commonly observed in the early stages of the disease, such as parietal network changes or functional connectivity changes between medial temporal and parietal lobe networks. Additionally, it remains unclear how these fMRI changes relate to established biomarkers of AD pathology such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of A?, tau and p-tau. Finally, it remains unclear if hippocampal, parietal or functional connectivity changes can be observed in cognitively normal individuals who have a significant memory concern and may represent an even earlier phase along the AD continuum. The current project proposes to directly address these questions in a high-resolution neuroimaging study of hippocampal and parietal network function, examining functional connectivity between these networks and their association with CSF measures of A?, tau and p-tau in subjects along the prodromal continuum of AD. Targeted fMRI activation tasks will be employed designed to tax hippocampal sub region specific function and parietal network function. High-resolution resting state fMRI will be employed to assess connectivity changes between hippocampal and parietal networks. CSF samples will be collected to assess the relationship between these network changes and CSF measures of A?, tau and p-tau. These methods will be employed in four groups of subjects: (1) cognitively normal subjects with subjective memory concerns (SMC), (2) subjects with early MCI (EMCI), (3) late MCI (LMCI), and (4) healthy control subjects. Together the proposed studies will provide insight into the functional brain changes associated with hippocampal and parietal network dysfunction and functional connectivity between these networks in LMCI and EMCI subjects, compared to controls, and determine whether SMC subjects display similar abnormalities. These studies will thus shed light on the relationship between changes in these neural networks, cognitive performance and the accumulation of AD pathology in the brain in subjects across the early spectrum of disease. Finally, this work may provide evidence of whether fMRI measures of hippocampal network dysfunction can serve as a marker for the early development of AD pathology."
"9543294","ABSTRACT: PROJECT 4 Many Superfund (SF) chemicals (e.g., PAHs, PCBs, Chlorinated solvents) have been reported to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in several cell types. Preliminary studies suggest that most of the ROS induced by SF chemicals originates from the mitochondria and that CCl4-induced cardiomyocyte cell death is partly caused by impaired proteasome activity. The hypothesis that chronic exposure to xenobiotics leads to cellular dysfunction and cell death mainly via mitochondrial oxidative stress (MOS) will be tested. MOS results in excessive production of ROS, increased levels of oxidized mitochondrial proteins, lipids, and DNA, decreased ATP levels, and depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential. Project 4 will further explore whether MOS- related increases in ROS levels affects several cellular pathways, including cellular proteostasis, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function, and fibrosis. Moreover, preliminary data generated by the research team suggests that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) produce cardiotoxicity by MOS and impaired proteostasis. Since NSAIDs, such as diclofenac, are designed to be bioactive and bioaccumulate in animals, such as fish, it is very likely that these compounds would pose a larger problem than many current SF chemicals in the near future. Among the project aims is to investigate the effects of drug (diclofenac)-SF chemical mixtures. These hypotheses will be tested in cell cultures and chronic animal models. The research team will develop cell-based assays to evaluate the mechanistic basis of xenobiotics effects on MOS and proteostasis (with Core A, Core B and Project 5). This project will evaluate the effects of chronic exposure to xenobiotics on increased MOS, apoptosis, fibrosis, heart damage and associated alterations of plasma oxidized protein levels (with Core A, and B), and develop methods to monitor MOS and impaired proteostasis from chronic exposure to chemicals (with Project 1, 2 and 3 as well as Core A and B). The long term goal of this work is to develop a high-content and medium throughput bioassay to test the potentials of SF chemicals to cause MOS and proteostasis, and obtain a biomarker of MOS associated biological effects for bio-fluid analysis. Overall, this project will investigate a novel hypothesis that current SF chemicals, as well as potential future SF chemicals, cause cellular dysfunction mainly via MOS."
"9463627","Recent US health care payment policies have focused on improving quality of care while constraining costs. One prominent example is the formation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). ACOs are networks of health care providers that take on responsibility for managing the health of a group of patients across the full continuum of health care settings and providers, and are held financially accountable for providing high-quality and low-cost care. ACOs are one of the most important and far-reaching recent changes to health care, with exponential growth over the past four years, covering over 28 million lives by 2016. Early evidence lends support to the premise that ACOs can improve quality while constraining costs. However, there is concern that ACOs could widen existing health care disparities. On one hand, socially vulnerable groups (such as racial and ethnic minorities and patients living in impoverished neighborhoods) have much to gain from ACOs, as they have a higher prevalence of many chronic health conditions, receive worse quality of care, and experience worse health outcomes. On the other hand, ACOs face a number of challenges in meeting the needs of vulnerable populations. First, early ACOs may be located in areas with lower poverty rates. Providers forming ACOs tend to be large, financially well-off group practices, systematically excluding providers who serve a disproportionate share of vulnerable patients, and resulting in poor access of vulnerable patients to ACO providers. Second, because many vulnerable patients are chronically ill, high-cost patients whose outcomes could worsen quality and cost metrics used to evaluate ACOs, ACO physicians may avoid caring for them, resulting in reduced attribution of vulnerable patients to ACO providers. Third, ACOs may be ill equipped to provide high-quality care to vulnerable groups because of the diverse needs of these complex patients, resulting in increased disparities in patient outcomes. It is unknown whether ACOs will effectively serve vulnerable patients and there is increasing concern that ACO implementation will worsen disparities. Our aims are to: (1) examine physician participation in ACOs in relation to the proportion of vulnerable patients in a region or practice; (2) examine changes in share of vulnerable patients in physicians' patient panels in relation to ACO participation; (3) examine the effect of ACOs on disparities in quality (including preventive care, chronic disease management, unnecessary ER visits, hospitalizations, and readmissions) and costs of care (Medicare payments); and (4) explore heterogeneity in the effects of ACOs on disparities in care across physician groups that differ in practice characteristics. We do so using a unique dataset with detailed information on provider participation in Medicare ACOs, merged with national Medicare claims data measuring quality of care and costs for both enrollees and non-enrollees. Results from this study will provide empirical evidence of the effect of ACOs on disparities in care and provide guidance on how to alter current ACO policy to reduce disparities in order to maximize the positive effects of reform payment."
"9461588","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gladstone seeks to increase diversity in biomedical research by providing eight summer research opportunities for undergraduate students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. Our program, Promoting Underrepresented Minority Advancement in the Sciences (PUMAS) aims 1) to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students who receive baccalaureate degrees in science and 2) expand and diversify the future graduate school student population. Our ultimate goal is to increase the number of well-trained URM biomedical research scientists. The PUMAS program will recruit two types of undergraduates. First, we will recruit students attending 4-year colleges and universities from our Gladstone Summer Scholars (GSS) high school internship program. GSS students have already experienced one summer experience working in Gladstone laboratories; therefore PUMAS will reengage these already targeted URM students who have completed their first year of undergraduate work to pursue their passion for biomedical research. Second, we will recruit students attending community college who intend to transfer to a 4-year university. We will partner with the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), Transfer Alliance Project (TAP) to identify URM students at community colleges in the San Francisco/Bay Area. We will seek students who have completed most of their math and science requirements and are looking to transfer to a science program at a 4-year school. For eight weeks, PUMAS participants will be paired with a scientific mentor at Gladstone to work on a specific research project. They will spend 80% of their time conducting biomedical research, including independent research activities, one-on-one mentoring, laboratory meetings, scientific lectures, seminars, journal clubs, and other academic and professional development activities. They will spend 20% of their time participating in supplementary educational activities. This includes weekly workshops on topics such as preparing graduate school applications, primer on grad school life, and a series of public speaking practice sessions geared towards improving student's scientific communication skills. PUMAS students will also participate in a 20-hr Laboratory Skills Bootcamp and a three-class series on the responsible conduct of research. The PUMAS program will culminate with a poster session in which students describe their work, hypothesis and results to the scientific community at Gladstone and UCSF. A student's passion for a scientific career must be cultivated both during and after a laboratory internship experience. Thus, Gladstone will continue to engage students in a variety of follow-up activities, such as securing a successive summer research experience at Gladstone or at other institutions and assisting students with applications for competitive fellowships in both college and graduate school. Ultimately, the aim is to increase the number of URM students pursuing biomedical research as a career. (End of Abstract)"
"9417001","Vascular complications due to diabetes mellitus (DM) are the result of sustained vascular injury with insufficient vascular repair. In chronic diabetes, vascular reparative mechanism can be lost resulting in development of microvascular complications (MVC), such as diabetic retinopathy (DR). We assessed the reparative function of progenitor cells that circulate in the peripheral blood of diabetic individuals and found that the vascular wall-derived progenitor cells, endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs), were depleted in diabetics with MVC. Bone marrow- derived progenitor cells, CD45+CD34+ were dysfunctional in diabetics with MVC. We found that human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived ECFCs displayed the ability to form functional and durable blood vessels in vivo and conferred therapeutic revascularization by connecting with and remaining integrated with host rodent vessels long term. We characterized a mesoderm subset (SSEA5-KNA+ cells) generated from hiPSCs that gives rise to ECFCs. Finally, we used hiPSCs to generate CD34+CD45+ cells and tested the impact of co- administration of these cells with ECFCs within the vitreous. The addition of CD34+CD45+ cells with ECFCs resulted in the enhanced survival, function and reparative ability of the ECFCs. This beneficial effect was mediated by reducing retinal oxidative stress and inflammation.  These novel and paradigm shifting findings led us to hypothesize: the hiPSC-derived- mesoderm subset (SSEA5-KNA+) can be utilized for long term revascularization of vasodegenerative capillaries and their reparative action can be further enhanced by coinjection of CD34+CD45+ cells that provide anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.  Three aims will test this hypothesis: Aim1: To determine whether hiPSC-derived SSEA5- KNA+ cells generated from either healthy donors or diabetic donors can give rise to ECFCs and pericytes to repair retinal vessels in mouse models of DR. Aim 2: To generate CD34+CD45+ cells from diabetic or control iPSCs and examine whether they enhance the function of SSEA5- KNA+ cells when co-injected into mouse models of DR. Aim 3: Our hypothesis predicts that hiPSC-derived SSEA5-KNA+ cells and CD34+CD45+ cells in combination can optimally support vascular repair in a Western diet-induced type 2 diabetic primate model of DR. The outcome of this work will provide a paradigm-changing approach for autologous cell therapy by optimizing the use of hiPSC-derived cells to enable highly efficient production of vascular cells for tissue/organ-based vascular repair."
"9457159","My primary research interests address chronic inflammatory lung diseases and the impact that environmental exposures play in the compromise of lung innate defense against pathologic lung injury. Utilizing pre-clinical mouse models and state-of-the-art molecular, biochemical, and cellular approaches, I collaborate closely with pulmonologists who practice at the VA to conduct relevant pre-clinical research that can be used to address current clinical concerns. Listed below is a summary of my VA- funded research project: Malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde adducts and lung injury. Alcohol abuse causing increased susceptibility to pneumonia has been known for over 200 years. Hospitalized individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) have a 3-fold risk of mortality from pneumonia. Alcohol modulates both the innate and adaptive immune systems of the lung resulting in increased susceptibility and decreased resolution of infection. Because the majority (>90%) individuals with AUDs smoke cigarettes, we have chosen to take the public health relevant approach of studying the combination lung injury effects of both cigarettes and alcohol. In our previous funding cycle, we identified that the lungs represent a unique environment for the formation of stable malondialdehyde- acetaldehyde protein adducts (MAA adducts), but only under conditions of combined cigarette smoke and alcohol exposure. These MAA adducts cause airway epithelial cell cilia slowing and impair the innate pathogen clearance from the lung. Our published and preliminary data demonstrate that surfactant protein D (SPD) is a major lung protein that gets adducted when lung aldehyde concentrations are elevated during combined smoke and alcohol exposure. Using human samples derived from the NIAAA-supported Colorado Pulmonary Alcohol Research Consortium, we have found that MAA adducts are detected in the lung lavage macrophages and fluid only in individuals with AUDs who also smoke. We have observed that the AUD smokers have decreased lung mucosal sIgA and that MAA adduct treatment of airway epithelium blocks transcytotic processing of sIgA mucosal secretion. Because of these important and novel observations, we now propose to extend our research on the pathogenesis of the MAA adduct to lung macrophages, mucosal sIgA, and SPD. Our overall hypothesis is that MAA adducts uniquely form in the lungs of individuals who consume both alcohol and smoke cigarettes, leading to alterations in innate lung defense. We will investigate this hypothesis through 3 aims: Aim 1: MAA adducted lung SPD (MAA-SPD) binds to lung macrophages via scavenger receptor A leading to alterations in macrophage function; Aim 2: MAA-SPD prevents sIgA mucosal secretion in lung by altering epithelial cell processing of dimerized IgA; and Aim 3: MAA adduction of SPD decreases its anti- microbial action (Funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs Merit Award: VA I01 BX003635; 2016-2020)."
"9619480","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Almost nothing is known about the gut mycobiome in health or disease. Recently, we made the novel observation that peptide YY (PYY), a gut hormone classically recognized for its role in satiety, is abundantly expressed and packaged in discrete dense core granules of Paneth cells (PC) and secreted luminally, suggesting a previously unrecognized role as an antimicrobial peptide (AMP). PYY is remarkably similar in structure and charge distribution to a class of AMPs typified by the amphibian magainin-2 peptide. Unlike magainin-2, PYY is not anti-bacterial; instead PYY specifically targets the virulent (hyphal), but not commensal yeast forms, of gut fungi, specifically Candida albicans. Thus, PYY could play a key role in maintaining fungal commensalism in the healthy gut. Interestingly, Paneth cell dysfunction has been reported in patients with ileal Crohn's disease (iCD), which has been linked to several genetic variants, immune and inflammatory stress, and other factors. Moreover, genetic variants and immune factors can inhibit PYY's bioconversion to a more active, hydrolyzed form. Altogether, these factors can promote fungal virulence that contributes to the pathogenesis of iCD and may explain the observed increases in fungal load and positive anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae serum antibodies (or ASCA) that are often associated with risk and severity of iCD. Thus, the proposed studies will not only provide key insights into mechanisms and mediators of host-fungal interactions in the gut, but also potentially transform our understanding of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) and identify those patients mostly likely to benefit from measures to restore fungal commensalism.  This multi-PI proposal involves two investigators with complementary expertise in the study of IBD, host- microbe interactions (Chang, UChicago), and fungal commensalism and virulence (particularly C.albicans) (Noble, UCSF). All clinical studies and sample acquisition will be performed at the University of Chicago and Northwestern Medical Center. The proposal will apply human subjects research, advances in experimental systems and technologies, and multi-omic approaches to address the hypothesis that PC-PYY dysfunction in iCD, from impaired PYY expression, secretion, and/or bioconversion, promotes increased fungal load and virulence, contributing to immune activation, inflammation, and disease. Specific mechanisms involved in the regulation, processing and actions of PC-PYY in health and IBD will be explored using experimental models derived from patients themselves and PYY-null mice. Finally, the ability to reverse fungal pathology to restore states of commensalism will PYY will be examined. Thus, the innovation of this study lies not only in the discovery, but the promise it brings to developing precision medicine tools and approaches for iCD patients and other human disorders caused by fungal pathogens."
"9673578","PROJECT SUMMARY The parasitic infection schistosomiasis afflicts 200 million people worldwide and is clinically treated by a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). Despite the fact that PZQ has served as a stalwart anthelmintic for decades, the molecular basis of action of this clinical agent is not understood. This lack of mechanistic information impedes the rational design of alternative therapeutics and is worrisome in the face of emergence of schistosome strains exhibiting refractoriness to PZQ exposure. New approaches for studying the effectors engaged by PZQ in vivo are therefore needed. In this R21 application, we advance a new approach for resolving the mechanism of action of PZQ and for establishing a novel platform for antischistosomal drug discovery. This builds on the observation that PZQ evokes a complete axis duplication during regenerating of free-living planarian flatworms yielding viable, two- headed animals with integrated nervous systems. This stark visual phenotype is interrogable by chemical and genetic (in vivo RNAi) screening in the planarian system, approaches which demonstrate that PZQ action is opposed by serotonergic (5-HT) signaling. These data advance the simple hypothesis that PZQ acts a ligand of flatworm 5-HT receptors. Here, we have established methodology to test this hypothesis and to define the pharmacophore of schistosome 5-HT receptors. As these receptors control flatworm motility, we predict agents that engage these receptors, including customized ergot derivatives, will yield novel antischistosomals. This work therefore aligns with the R21 remit for bringing a completely new approach to problems: exemplified in this case as a new model system for antiparasitic drug discovery that has potential to reveal how PZQ works, a roadblock that that has eluded definition for 30 years.

"9454444","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although prevention scientists have documented effective interventions to prevent adult substance abuse, antisocial behavior, and risky sexual behavior, these interventions have not been applied to optimize return on investment and thus have not yet been fully embraced by communities. This application proposes to map the relations between early risk profiles (and preventive intervention) and adult health and financial outcomes. Past studies have estimated these relations with regression coefficients that satisfy scholars but provide insufficient information to enable practitioners and policy makers to target children for intervention by age and risk profile. The proposed studies will identify the government service outcomes and financial costs associated with various risk profiles by age and the likely return on investment for the Fast Track intervention, which has been documented to prevent antisocial behavior and substance use problems. We propose interviews and administrative data collection at ages 30-34 with participants in each of two ongoing longitudinal studies that have followed children with detailed measurement of risk factors from kindergarten into adulthood, the Child Development Project (n=585, retention=90%) and the Fast Track randomized controlled trial (n=1199, retention=81%). We will pursue three aims: 1) Model the relation between early risk and adult health outcomes at different levels, qualities, and ages of risk, to identify optimal intervention timing and targets; 2) Map the relation between risk profile and adult service utilization and ultimate public costs in adulthood, to monetize the possible returns on prevention investment; and 3) Evaluate the impact of the Fast Track intervention on adult health and financial outcomes, by subgroups. The findings will provide a template for an emerging Science of Investing in Children to improve public health and protect public resources."
"9457229","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neutrophils, the most abundant circulating white blood cells in the human body, patrol the capillary networks of the lung monitoring the airspace. Here they provide the first line of defense against invading pathogens and toxin exposures. While neutrophil migration is essential for pathogen elimination in the lung, inadvertent targeting of these cells to the airspace can result in life threatening lung damage. The long term goal of this research is to identify the molecular pathways utilized during TREM-1 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1) dependent neutrophil migration into the airspace and leverage this information to develop therapeutic tools to prevent neutrophil-driven lung injury. TREM-1, initially discovered on human neutrophils and monocytes, serves as a critical amplifier of immune signaling. We recently discovered that neutrophil TREM-1 is required for transepithelial migration into the lung following gram negative infection. In addition to its established role in te amplification of inflammatory signaling, these findings identified a novel role for TREM-1 in neutrophil migration. During our characterization of human neutrophil migration, we identified a novel TREM-1 splice variant (TREM-1sv) protein stored in primary and secondary granules. This splice isoform is released during transepithelial migration. We also found in pilot studies that inhibition of extracellular ROS attenuates neutrophil transepithelial migration, and TREM-1 deficient neutrophils have reduced mitochondrial ROS production. In addition to a membrane isoform of TREM-1, a soluble form of the receptor has been described in human disease. However, the origin and function of this soluble molecule remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that neutrophil mitochondrial ROS and TREM-1sv modulate TREM-1 dependent transepithelial migration in the lung and that mitochondrial ROS is required for TREM-1 mediated migration. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims. 1. Determine if mitochondrial ROS is required for TREM-1 mediated neutrophil transepithelial migration. The goal of these studies is to investigate if pharmacologic and genetic modulation of mitochondrial ROS alters transepithelial migration. 2. Determine if TREM-1sv regulates ROS-driven neutrophil transepithelial migration. The goal of these studies is to determine if exogenous TREM-1 modulates the ability of neutrophils to cross the epithelial barrier either by altering neutrophil epithelial interactions or by abrogating mitochondrial ROS production. 3. Test the efficacy of TREM-1sv as a therapy to decrease neutrophil transepithelial migration in vivo. The goal of these studies is to determine if exogenous TREM-1sv can inhibit neutrophil migration into the airspace and decrease local inflammation."
"9457300","Summary: Project 2 Stubbs  Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with amyloid deposits, aggregates of misfolded proteins  characterized by -strands extending roughly perpendicular to the axes of long, unbranched fibrils. Examples  include Alzheimer's disease associated with the peptide A, Parkinson's disease associated with the  protein ?-synuclein, a number of diseases including Alzheimer's and chronic traumatic encephalopathy associated with  the protein tau, and Creuzfeldt-Jakob and others associated with the mammalian prion protein PrP.  These diseases have in common the property of self-propagation of the aberrant peptide fold, as originally  recognized in the mammalian prions derived from PrP. The structural and self-propagating properties of the  amyloid form of PrP are shared by other pathological amyloids, and these diseases are essentially all prion  diseases. Molecular structure and structural transitions are thus the key to understanding these diseases, and  eventually to designing diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.  Knowledge of the amyloid structure will provide information about the precursor oligomers that have in many  cases been identified as the toxic species, and share structural features with the fibrils. Knowledge of the  amyloid structure combined with information about the oligomers (Projects 3, 4) will also increase  understanding of the interconversion pathways that include the toxic species.  The overall goal of this project is to determine the structures of amyloids associated with some of the most  devastating neurodegenerative diseases. Amyloids are not conducive to crystallographic or solution NMR  studies, so the primary approaches are fiber diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy, well suited to relatively  disordered filamentous assemblies such as amyloids. Model restraints will also come from other methods.  The specific aims address A, tau, and PrP. Structural and biological differences between synthetic and brain-  derived A have been identified but not yet characterized. Tau and PrP studies will address the minimal  requirement for a self-propagating amyloid. Sample assays for self-propagation in vivo will be correlated with  the structural studies."

To fulfil this goal, CTRC addresses the following set of objectives using clearly-defined criteria and mechanisms to: (1) review new clinical research proposals for scientific rationale, appropriate design, and feasibility; (2) prioritize clinical research proposals using uniform and objective metrics in consultation with Winship?s cancer disease-site working groups and with Winship?s research programs to ensure alignment with Winship?s overall strategic objectives; (3) review and monitor the progress of active clinical studies for accrual and scientific validity, and to terminate protocols which are not meeting accrual targets and/or where new scientific evidence renders the study irrelevant; (4) determine and assign level of potential risk to patients enrolled on study that will inform the rigor and frequency of review by Winship?s Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC); and (5) provide a platform for educating the next generation of clinical researchers on the best practices in the design and conduct of cancer clinical trials. The CTRC functions as a distinct, independent body from the Winship Clinical Trials Office (CTO) and the DSMC. Significant changes instituted to enhance the function of the CTRC in response to suggestions emanating from the last CCSG competitive renewal include: (1) enactment of review guidelines to assess the ability of new studies to meet accrual targets, with special attention to potential eligibility conflict with ongoing clinical trials; (2) adding a requirement that new study proposals address scientific questions relevant to Winship?s overall mission and objectives of its research programs; (3) adding a requirement for institutional (investigator-initiated) proposals to undergo biostatistics review prior to submission for CTRC review and to include a co-investigator from Winship?s Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource (BBISR); (4) requiring a risk level determination at the time of scientific review for all treatment trials; (5) instituting a regular biennial survey of Winship members to obtain feedback on CTRC function and value added to Winship?s clinical research activities; and (6) recognizing outstanding CTRC members (excluding co-chairs) based on specific metrics including meeting attendance and protocol review."
"9475552","Project Summary Sensory systems must be plastic in order to allow learning throughout the lifespan; however, brain regions involved in processing sensory information undergo a significant decline in plasticity during both normal aging and in concert with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, olfactory deficits are estimated to affect more than half of the elderly population in the United States. One promising feature of the olfactory system, however, is its extensive capability for lifelong plasticity. In rodents, the olfactory bulb (OB) is one of the most plastic areas of the adult brain due to ongoing neurogenesis. Adult-born granule cells (abGCs) are the most numerous population of adult-born neurons, and during their maturation, they develop synapses with existing cells and integrate into the OB circuit. However, there is still limited information about the development of abGCs? responses to stimuli in vivo. This project aims to use longitudinal in vivo multiphoton calcium imaging of individual abGCs? odor-evoked responses to characterize (1) when abGCs first become responsive to olfactory stimuli and how the responses of individual neurons change over time as the cells mature and (2) how this process may be modified in the context of olfactory learning. Preliminary data indicates that on a population level, abGCs are more responsive to odors early during their development. This supports the hypothesis that abGCs? initially broad representations may be refined to enhance their selectivity for particular odors as they mature. Analyzing the odor response profiles of identified cells over time will allow the investigation of the timecourse of an individual cell?s odor response magnitude, stability and odor selectivity on a single cell level. In addition, training mice in an operant behavioral task during the critical period of a cohort of abGCs will provide insight into the effects of odor exposure and odor-reward associations on the stability and prevalence of abGC responses. Together, these experiments will provide important insights into the process by which adult-born neurons integrate into an existing circuit and possible mechanisms by which this process may be modified by learning in order to enhance sensory processing."
"9462745","MINORITY RECRUITMENT SATELLITE PROGRAM (CORE F)- PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the Minority Recruitment Satellite Program (MRSP) is to ensure that communities of color fully benefit from the knowledge generated by Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers and other NIH funded Alzheimer's research. We will achieve this goal by using evidence-based culturally tailored methods to disseminate information and translate new knowledge to health care professionals, trainees and the lay community with an emphasis on reaching underrepresented minorities who are at greater risk for AD and other dementias. The MRSP Core is also responsible for the recruitment and retention of African American participants for the Wisconsin ADRC Clinical Core and other affiliated studies. The activities of the MRSP represent a collaborative initiative involving the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health(UWSMPH) Section of Geriatrics and Gerontology, the UWSMPH Collaborative Center on Health Equity, the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Association Chapter Network (WAACN), the Alzheimer's and Dementia Alliance of Wisconsin (ADAW, the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), Wisconsin Geriatric Education Center (WGEC), and the Community-Academic Aging Research Network (CAARN) and the Wisconsin Institute for Healthy Aging (WIHA). The MRSP works closely with the Outreach, Recruitment and Education (ORE) Core to reach beyond the walls of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (UW SMPH) to engage communities across the state. The MRSP is fully integrated into the Clinical, Neuroimaging, Neuropathology, Biomarker and Biostatistics and Data Management Cores as well as the ORE Core (MRSP). Working together, we have been able to identify and resolve the barriers to research participation to create a solid foundation for the recruitment and retention of a diverse study population. Our successful recruitment efforts rely on the formation and maintenance of strong mutually beneficial relationships with individuals and organizations promoting the health and well-being of the Black community. We have made major contributions to NAPA's primary goal to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025 by increasing participation of African Americans in clinical trials and the study of preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD at the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). These efforts will be expanded during this renewal and new programs will be added to support our specific aims."
"9537575","ABSTRACT (Project 4: Lantz, Boitano, Zhang)  Inhalable dusts in the Southwest US, especially those found downwind of legacy mine tailings and smelters, can contain high levels of arsenic and other contaminants. It is well established that arsenic exposure occurring via ingestion can result in adverse health effects that prominently include lung disease. Around legacy mines, such as the Iron King Mine and Humboldt Smelter Superfund site, arsenic exposures can occur via inhalation of aerosolized dusts from the mine tailings or abandoned smelter. Our previous work with ingested arsenic has demonstrated that exposure can affect airway structure/function in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, data indicate that arsenic exposure compromises the barrier integrity of the airway epithelium by inducing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Such loss of airway epithelial barrier function can lead to reduced innate immunity, increased inflammation, increased exposure of underlying tissue to airway insults, increased airway infection and ultimately, lung disease. While inhalation of arsenic-containing dusts represents a more direct exposure on the airways, and thus, the potential for similar or exacerbated lung dysfunction, the consequences of such inhalation is not known. We will determine the impact of real world and synthetic arsenic-containing dust particulates on airway epithelial health and lung function. Our integrated approach uses high capacity in vitro toxicity evaluation to inform on dust particulates that will be used in well-established primary culture mechanistic in vitro and in vivo models of airway function. Our hypothesis is that arsenic exposure by inhalation leads to EMT that permanently reduces airway epithelial barrier function and increases the risk of airway/lung disease. These alterations are in part mediated through induction/modulation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) and dual oxidase (DUOX) activity leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We will test our hypotheses with the following three Specific Aims: Aim 1) Use integrative, dissection, and synergistic approaches to determine mining-associated dust toxicity on airway epithelial cells. Aim 2) Determine if exposure of mining dusts results in airway EMT. Aim 3) Determine if alteration in NOX/DUOX is necessary and sufficient to affect airway EMT following mining dust exposure. Successful completion of these studies will establish a mechanistic understanding of the contribution of arsenic (or other metals) in real world dusts (such as those found in mining communities) to lung disease"
"9462139","ABSTRACT Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) convey visual signals to the brain in the form of action potentials, the initiation and axonal propagation of which depend on the activation of RGC voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs). In photoreceptor degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), inner retinal neurons including RGCs in many cases remain intact and capable of generating action potential responses. RGCs thus represent a logical target for approaches aimed at restoring vision in advanced-stage AMD and related retinal diseases, by bypassing the nonfunctioning rod and cone photoreceptors and establishing direct RGC responsiveness to light. In a recent study of dorsal root ganglion cells (a non-retinal neuron widely studied as a model action-potential-generating cell type) and in hippocampal slice preparations, we have shown that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with a cell-targeting biomolecule enable robust light-induced NaV activation and resulting action potential generation. Essential features of the cell-targeted AuNP technique are: (i) functionalization of the light-absorbing AuNPs to localize them at or near the NaVs; (ii) upon the AuNP?s plasmon absorption of a millisecond/submillisecond light flash, AuNP radiation of the light energy as a nondamaging pulse of heat that creates a localized, transient, depolarizing capacitive current across the plasma membrane; and (iii) resulting activation, i.e., channel opening, of neighboring NaVs and thus action potential initiation by this depolarization. In this application we propose exploratory research to apply this AuNP approach to RGCs in the living eye of the rat. The project?s goal is to establish AuNP treatment conditions that achieve robust AuNP-mediated RGC photo-responsiveness in vivo. In rats for which rod and cone photoreceptor signaling to RGCs has been suppressed pharmacologically, we will intra-vitreally deliver AuNP conjugates designed for binding to the immediate vicinity of the RGC NaVs. Following treatment with the AuNP conjugates, we will employ in vivo recording of electroretinographic (ERG) signals associated with RGC activity, and of visual evoked potentials (VEPs), to analyze properties of RGC electrophysiological responses to AuNP photo-excitation. The research will involve variation of the size/structure of the AuNP, of the AuNP- conjugated RGC-targeting component, and of the duration and energy [(intensity) x (duration)] of AuNP- excitatory flashes. Accompanying the in vivo experiments will be all-optical stimulation/recording of AuNP- mediated action potentials in isolated rat retina, and histological analysis of retinas treated in vivo and in vitro with AuNPs. Results of the in vitro retina experiments will guide the selection of in vivo treatment conditions to be systematically investigated and facilitate interpretation of the in vivo data. Leading the research will be David R. Pepperberg, PhD (Univ. of Illinois at Chicago) and Francisco Bezanilla, PhD (Univ. of Chicago)."
"9465411","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          This study aims to:  (1) develop new markers for response to tuberculosis (TB) treatment through expression profiling or analysis of patterns of RNA expression in human blood as quantified by microarray technology and (2) determine whether small regulatory RNA (sRNA) secreted by M tuberculosis act to suppress expression of host-protective genes in macrophages through RNA interference (RNAi). New markers for response to TB treatment. Specific disease states may produce signature RNA patterns not seen in other conditions and the pathogen-specific component of human expression may distinguish between infections. Identifying expression that is specific to TB requires a clinically-relevant comparison group. To avoid over-estimating test accuracy, biomarkers should be developed in the patients likely to be tested in practice with an intention-to-test approach. The first step of this project will identify and validate a TB expression panel by comparison with patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in cohorts of subjects in the U.S. and Uganda. The second step will test whether expression of the TB panel in blood resolves with successful treatment of active TB. We hypothesize that expression of genes in the TB panel will change to resemble expression in controls without pneumonia, reflecting resolving immune response as bacillary burden decreases. Finally, it is unclear whether blood is a surrogate for understanding TB-specific responses in the lung. Although blood expression may identify effective biomarkers even without recapitulating lung expression, interpretation of the pathobiological significance of blood expression demands understanding the relationship between blood and lung expression. To determine the extent to which TB-specific expression in blood reflects inflammatory pathways in the lung this study will compare expression in simultaneously collected blood and BAL while adjusting for the different cell types present in each specimen type. sRNA secreted by Mtb may subvert host-protective macrophage responses via RNAi. RNAi, the biological process in which endogenous non-coding sRNA molecules bind mRNA and inhibit gene expression, is a fundamental regulatory mechanism in both Mtb and humans. sRNA secreted by Mtb was recently shown to increase bacterial viability in macrophages. We hypothesize that the mechanism for this increased viability is Mtb-derived sRNA silencing of expression of important human host-protective genes. Specifically, through RNA sequencing we have identified Mtb-derived sRNA which are predicted to bind the 3' untranslated region of key host-protective human mRNA transcripts for IkB?, TRAF-3 and TRAF-5. We propose to validate this novel form of cross-species RNAi. If confirmed, this would represent a novel form of host-pathogen interaction that could offer new targets for anti-TB therapy."
"9462641","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and fatal disease for which there is currently no cure. Pathological changes in this disease involve remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature, including marked pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation, leading to increased vascular resistance, right ventricular failure and death. Despite active research in PAH and improvements in patient care, there are no available therapies to hinder or reverse the vascular remodeling in this devastating disease. Numerous studies have emerged highlighting the critical importance of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and its bioactive product, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), in regulating cell survival and proliferation. SphK1, a conserved, oncogenic enzyme, has notably been implicated in the progression, invasion and metastasis of several cancer types, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy of SphK1 antagonism in decreasing tumor size. Exciting preliminary findings from the Machado and Natarajan labs have identified the SphK1/S1P signaling axis as a potential novel therapeutic target for vascular remodeling in PAH. We have shown that both SphK1 and S1P are elevated in PAH patients and mediate PASMC proliferation in vitro. Additionally, we determined that S1P-induced PASMC proliferation was mediated through ligation to its high- affinity receptor, S1PR2. Despite these important findings, little is currenty known about the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating SPHK1 gene expression or S1P/S1PR2-mediated PASMC proliferation in the context of PAH pathogenesis. In this comprehensive proposal, we will test the hypothesis that hypoxia and elevated levels of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), both pathologically found within the pulmonary vasculature in PAH, are involved in SPHK1 gene regulation and contribute to vascular remodeling. Based on our preliminary studies, we will also test whether S1P/S1PR2-induced PASMC proliferation is mediated through activation and interaction of STAT3 and HIF1a transcription factors, both known to modulate cell proliferation. The therapeutic potential of targeting S1P/S1PR2 signaling will be evaluated in established, preclinical rodent models of pulmonary hypertension. Together, these studies will provide significant mechanistic insight into the role of the SphK1/S1P signaling axis in pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies in this fatal disease."
"9459342","Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics (AME) proposes the development of a novel portable wireless hearing aid accessory that utilizes head pose and eye tracking of the hearing aid user to steer a microphone array in the direction of interest. A common problem for hearing aid users is the difficulty of participating in conversations in a noisy environment such as at a workplace or restaurant. While hearing aids can improve speech intelligibility in certain types of noise, it is difficult to distinguish between multiple talkers where some might be ?noise? and others are not. Two of the best solutions for improving hearing aid performance in these scenarios include: 1) moving a separate companion microphone closer to the source or 2) aiming a beamforming array microphone, which is more sensitive to sound in a particular direction, towards the desired sound source. While companion microphones have been shown to be effective, they have drawbacks that have limited their use. Companion microphones require an active involvement of the speakers to use microphones. There are many situations where this is impractical or socially awkward. There are also microphone beamforming array solutions on the market, but there are challenges with steering or pointing the array to the source of interest as well as making the array unobtrusive. This Proposal presents an innovative solution for using a beamforming array microphone that solves the issues of being cumbersome and slow to point, especially in a fast moving conversation of many people. The front facing camera (the side with the screen) on a smartphone will be utilized to detect the head pose and eye direction of the hearing aid user's focus of attention. The microphone array, attached to the back of a smartphone, will be electronically steered with signal processing to collect sound from the direction the user is looking. The processed audio will then be transmitted directly to the user's hearing aid via a digital wireless link. The user will simply hold the smartphone in a natural manner for someone using a smartphone and look at the person in a group they want to listen to. In Phase II, AME will build a production prototype system and test it with hearing impaired individuals."
"9477347","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Abstract: Our research team has been studying Gulf War Veterans with chronic gastrointestinal pain disorders for over a decade (Dunphy et al., 2003). Many Gulf War Veterans developed chronic gastrointestinal pain during their deployment to the Persian Gulf in 1990-91. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of this chronic gastrointestinal pain are not well understood but cause significant morbidity in our Gulf War Veteran population. The mechanisms underlying this chronic gastrointestinal pain disorder in Gulf War Veterans need to be established. In preliminary studies, we have identified unique microRNAs (miRNAs) present in the colon tissue of Gulf War Veterans who returned with chronic gastrointestinal pain. Based on these preliminary findings, our overall hypothesis is: Aberrant expression of specific miRNAs dysregulates downstream miRNA targets (?glutamate & ?opioid receptors) that cause, contribute to, or facilitate chronic gastrointestinal pain in Gulf War Veterans.  We have established techniques to determine inter- and intra-cellular roles of miRNAs in the epigenetic regulation of the expression of their down-stream target genes. These methods include: (i) interaction analysis of miRNAs; (ii) transfection of miRNAs into cultures of human colonic epithelial cells; into rat colonic epithelial cells and into rat dorsal root ganglion cells (Aim 3) (iii) in vivo injection of miRNAs in a validated rat model to test for a reduction in visceral hypersensitivity (Greenwood-Van Meerveld et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015).  Identifying the role of miRNA signaling should: (i) Fill an important gap in our understanding of chronic gastrointestinal pain, especially the dysregulation of nociceptive pathways. (ii) Lead to therapeutic strategies that use small molecules that mimic or inhibit specific miRNAs that target gene expression. This will overcome a critical barrier - lack of effective treatments for our Gulf War Veterans who suffer from chronic gastrointestinal pain disorders and lead to the development of novel, miRNA-based sets of diagnostic markers."
"9457157","My long-term career goal is to improve the quality of human life, including that of Veterans, through my research. My laboratory focuses on two broad and complimentary research areas: 1) cancer biology and 2) prevention and experimental therapeutics of cancer. My overall goal is to define the critical molecular and biochemical events that occur during cancer development that in turn will assist in identifying targets and new approaches and strategies for cancer management. While interested in cancer in general, my recent focus has been on skin and prostate cancers, both of which disproportionally affect the Veteran population. Examples of ongoing research in my laboratory are as follows. We are studying the role and functional significance of mitotic regulators, including the polo-like kinase (Plk) family of serine/threonine kinases, and how these factors interact with other important cell signaling pathways to influence cancer development and progression. In addition, we are trying to understand the role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ -dependent deacetylases, namely the Sirtuin family proteins, in the development and/or progression of cancer. The second major focus of my research is to define the cancer chemopreventive/therapeutic potential of a variety of agents, such as resveratrol (a phytoalexin antioxidant found in grapes, nuts, berries and red wine), melatonin (the chief secretory product of the pineal gland and a known antioxidant), vitamin E (the major antioxidant in biomembranes) and selenium (an essential micronutrient for humans). My current VA-sponsored research focuses on identifying the mechanism of melanoma development and progression. This research area is extremely relevant to VA healthcare as the U.S. military engages in missions all over the world, including in the Middle East (Iraq and Afghanistan). Deployment to these regions results in significant UV irradiation exposure that increases the risk for malignant melanoma in the Veterans returning from these areas. Based on several studies, an increased incidence of melanoma was reported for World War II Veterans stationed in the Pacific and those exposed to dioxin-contaminated herbicides during Operation Ranch Hand in Vietnam. My ongoing research aims at defining the molecular mechanism of melanoma development. I believe that my research findings are moving towards the identification of novel strategies for the management of this deadly neoplasm. Thus, my work is relevant and significant to Veteran's healthcare and is in line with the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The results of my research are published in a wide range of high-impact scientific journals. I have published more than 170 papers, 150 abstracts and several book chapters (Total Citations: 17,705; h-index, 65; i10-index: 1256 Source: Google Scholar; 8/2016).  I serve as an Associate Editor of two well-respected journals, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology and Photochemistry and Photobiology, and am a member of the Editorial Board of several other journals. I am regularly invited to participate in the peer-review of grants for national and international funding agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Defense. I am currently a regular member of the Radiation Therapeutics and Biology (RTB) Study Section of the NIH.  I mentored numerous junior scientists at all levels (undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, and junior faculty). Many of my previous trainees/mentees have successfully obtained independent positions in academics and industry. In addition, I extensively collaborated with numerous scientists within the VA as well as at the University of Wisconsin, other universities in the U.S., and outside the country (internationally). I have always believed in the notion that `two heads are better than one'. A majority of my collaborations have been very successful, resulting in numerous papers and extramural funding.  In summary, I believe that I am well qualified for the BLR&D Merit Review Research Career Scientist (RCS) Award, and I appreciate your consideration of my application."
"9551503","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The discovery of ischemic preconditioning in the 1980's revealed the presence of a potent endogenous protective mechanism to increase ischemic tolerance in the heart that could be produced by brief periods of ischemia and reperfusion preceding a prolonged ischemia/reperfusion event. Ischemic postconditioning, evoked prior to reperfusion of ischemic tissue, has provided a clinically relevant target for cardiac protection. Numerous endogenous ligands and pharmaceuticals, includeing volatile anesthetics, produce pre and post conditioning in the heart, providing cardiac protection from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Despite significant insights gained over the last 30 years into mechanisms of cardiac protection, the full potential of harnessing pre and post conditioning in the clinical setting remains unfulfilled. Cardiac protection strategies in the clinical setting are limited by several factors including age and diseases related to aging. We have shown previously that the signaling molecules involved in cardioprotection need to function within caveolae and interact with caveolins to produce effective cardioprotection. We propose to test the novel hypothesis that loss of caveolin and disruption of precise cardioprotective signaling within caveolar microdomains results in the impaired volatile anesthetic-induced cardiac protection evident in aged animals and that re- expression of caveolin can restore volatile anesthetic-induced cardiac protective signaling that has been impaired by aging. The aims of the grant will 1: Determine mechanisms involved the interaction of volatile anesthetics and caveolins at the sarcolemmal membrane in young and aged cardiac myocytes, 2: Determine the mechanisms involved in the interaction of volatile anesthetic-induced cardioprotective signaling molecules, caveolins and mitochondria in young and aged cardiac myocytes, and 3: Determine if overexpression of Cav-3 restores volatile anesthetic-induced cardiac protection in aged mice and human hearts. We will use state of the art molecular biology techniques, electron paramagnetic resonance technology, imaging technology, and physiological techniques in cardiac myocytes, human myocardium and clinically relevant models of I/R injury to focus on mechanism and produce important preclinical data to support the use of caveolins as novel therapeutics for aged veteran patients at risk of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury."
"9466641","Gene gun delivery of DNA vaccines, also known as particle mediated epidermal delivery or PMED, delivers DNA vaccines coated onto 1 micron sized gold particles directly into cells of the epidermis. It achieves pain-free delivery, is considerably more efficient than electroporation or other DNA vaccine delivery approaches (requires 100-1000 fold lower doses), and induces both systemic and mucosal responses. The gene gun stands out as the only DNA vaccine technology to date that has consistently induced T cell responses and protective levels of antibody in 100% of vaccinated subjects in human clinical trials. In addition, in preclinical studies, the research grade gene gun effectively induces mucosal responses that correlate with enhanced protection mice, nonhuman primates and swine models of influenza, HSV and HIV infections. However, when transitioned into the clinic, the immunogenicity of PMED DNA vaccines in humans using a newly-designed clinical gene gun resulted in lower immune responses than what was achieved with the research device in preclinical animal models. Our preliminary studies show that these earlier clinical devices fell short of optimal engineering. In particular, the first clinical gene guns delivered the particles into a smaller area and fewer particles penetrated the skin when compared to the research device. This is likely due to the use of a polystyrene nozzle in the clinical device that generated an electrostatic charge and restricted gold particle acceleration. In addition, for both the research and clinical devices, the density distribution of the particles fell in a bell curve with the center of the target having a much higher density of particles and lower viability than the outer area. This decreased viability of the cells in the center of the target caused reduced DNA vaccine expression due to a dead center. Another obstacle to more robust vaccine expression in the use of DNA coated particles is that DNA must enter the nucleus, while the majority of delivered particles now reach only the cytoplasm and fall short of the nucleus. Here, we propose to address these limitations by incorporating novel engineering modifications to the research and clinical gene guns ? a ?spinner? apparatus that will increase the target size and particle distribution and a hybrid aluminum/plastic disposable clinical gene gun barrel to reduce electrostatic restriction of the gold particles. We will also, in collaboration with GE Global Research, investigate novel nucleic acid formulations for better nuclear localization and vaccine expression by employing a Rolling Circle Amplified (RCA) DNA and stable RNA and RNA/DNA compositions as strategies to increase the number of cells expressing the gene and the amount of protein expressed per cell. We hypothesize these modifications will result in generation of a new, more effective research and clinical gene guns with enhanced immunogenicity in vivo."
"9551499","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Myocardial infarction (MI), even with current reperfusion strategies, remains the leading cause of heart failure. Identifying the events that induce adverse cardiac remodeling post-MI will provide therapeutic targets to prevent, slow, or reverse progression to heart failure. A major risk factor for a poor response to MI is age. With age, there is an increased infiltration of macrophages into the left ventricle (LV), which stimulates extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and leads to a subtle but significant change in LV function evidenced by reduced early (E) to late (A) filling ratios. Post-MI, macrophage infiltration and ECM accumulation are driving events, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 regulates both of these processes. MMP-9 deletion attenuates the cardiac response to aging, in part by shifting macrophage polarization from a pro-inflammatory M1 state to an anti- inflammatory M2 state. Our preliminary data demonstrate that MMP-9 levels are much increased in older mice at day 7 post-MI, and this in-crease in MMP-9 yields more M1 macrophages to extend the inflammatory response and delay the healing phase. MMP-9 deletion restores the M1 and M2 polarization balance.  This renewal proposal will address the central hypothesis that during the MI response in aging mice, MMP-9 enhances pro-inflammatory M1 polarization and attenuates anti- inflammatory M2 polarization to induce adverse remodeling.  To test our hypothesis, we will determine macrophage polarization kinetics in young (3-6 month old) and old (18-23 month old) wild type and MMP-9 null mice. We will evaluate how MMP-9 activates macrophage polarization and how this process is altered with aging (aim 1), whether young hearts can be switched to an old phenotype by stimulating M1 macrophage polarization (aim 2), and whether old hearts can be switched to a young phenotype by stimulating M2 macrophage polarization (aim 3). This proposal is unique, because most studies use MMP-9 as an output measurement whereby we will use MMP-9 as a major input. Our multi-faceted approach includes in vivo physiology, cell biology, biochemistry, proteomics, and histological approaches to further advance the mechanistic understanding of the origins of post-MI LV remodeling and provide targets for translational research. The results of these studies have high significance for the aging veteran population."
"9462700","PROJECT 3 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Project 3 of the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer s Disease Research Center (JHADRC) is focused on the regulation of ?-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptors (AMPARs) by amyloid ? (A?) in order to identify mechanisms by which A? alters synaptic transmission and plasticity during the early stages of Alzheimer s disease (AD) prior to cell death. AMPARs mediate the majority of fast excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system and are dynamically regulated by modifications such as phosphorylation and by interactions with other proteins. This regulation of AMPARs is critical for modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity. We propose that A? induces synaptic deficits by interfering with the normal regulation of AMPARs, resulting in down-regulation of AMPARs at excitatory synapses. Understanding this process is critical both for understanding early disease pathology and for generating effective therapies. Our project consists of the following three specific aims: (1) To test the hypothesis that elevated A? alters AMPAR phosphorylation to reduce surface AMPAR expression by altering interactions with proteins involved in receptor trafficking. This aim will allow us to identify cellular targets downstream of A? that may provide a mechanistic focus to directly slow or halt early progression of A?-mediated cognitive decline. (2) To use novel site-specific AMPAR phosphorylation mutant mice to determine the physiological and A?-mediated pathological role of phosphorylation in AMPAR trafficking, basal synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity. This aim will provide novel insight into the role of specific phosphorylation sites in different aspects of A?-induced synapse dysfunction. (3) To test the hypothesis that physiological and behavioral deficits induced by A? in vivo can be rescued with compensatory alterations in AMPAR modulation. In this aim we will take advantage of a transgenic mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1dE9 mice) that more closely mimics the exposure of neurons to chronic, endogenously-produced A?, as occurs in AD patients. These mice will be used to determine if disruption of AMPAR phosphorylation or specific protein interactions can ameliorate deficits in synaptic plasticity and memory induced by chronic A? elevation. Through the studies in this proposal, we will identify mechanisms underlying A?-induced decreases in synaptic AMPAR expression and will determine if inhibition of these molecular changes is sufficient to rescue A?-induced deficits in synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and memory."
"9528154","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) is synthesized in the kidney by Cyp27b1 and inactivated in all target tissues via Cyp24a1. The two genes are reciprocally regulated in the kidney by a number of hormones that serve to maintain appropriate physiologic levels of circulating 1,25(OH)2D3. In spite of their importance, however, little is known of the molecular details that facilitate expression of Cyp27b1 in the kidney or of Cyp24a1 in this tissue and elsewhere. This represents an enormous deficit in our understanding of the vitamin D system, a gap that is highlighted in a variety of diseases of mineral metabolism. In recent studies, we have identified key genomic regions in the Cyp27b1 locus in mice that mediate Cyp27b1 regulation by PTH, FGF23 and 1,25(OH)2D3, a module that is present only in the kidney. Deletion of components of this module reduce Cyp27b1 expression in the kidney but have no effect on Cyp27b1 expression in non-renal target cells (NRTCs). In view of these findings, we propose the following molecular studies. Aim 1: Characterize the endocrine module and its individual components in the mouse kidney that mediates Cyp27b1 expression and regulation by PTH, 1,25(OH)2D3 and FGF23 in vivo. We will use ChIP-seq analysis and CRISPR/Cas9 deletion studies in vivo to further characterize a regulatory module we have discovered in the kidney that functions to regulate the expression of Cyp27b1. We will also define the location of an independent module in the Cyp27b1 gene locus that mediates the actions of inflammatory signaling in NRTCs. These studies are designed to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underpin the metabolic activation of vitamin D. Aim 2: Characterize the regulatory sub-modules that control Cyp24a1 expression and regulation by PTH, 1,25(OH)2D3 and FGF23 in the kidney in vivo. Cyp24a1 in the kidney plays a coordinating role in regulating blood levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 and other vitamin D metabolites. We will use the methods outlined in Aim 1 to elucidate the genomic mechanisms through which this gene is downregulated by PTH and upregulated by both FGF23 and 1,25(OH)2D3. Mutational analysis in mice will allow us to define the clusters of enhancers and the sites of action of transcription factors and comodulators that are responsible for these activities. Aim 3: Utilize dietary manipulation to test and confirm regulatory hypotheses developed in Cyp27b1-compromised mouse strains relevant to disease. In this aim, we plan to test a hypothetical model that explains the complex phenotypes that have emerged following deletion of components of the kidney-specific regulatory module. We will use dietary manipulation of Ca, Pi, and vitamin D metabolites to test our hypotheses."
"9513280","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is caused by a combination of blood hypercoagulability, endothelial dysregulation, and blood stasis. This biologic dysregulation has environmental and inherited sources that interact to modulate thrombotic risk. Female sex-hormone-based oral contraceptives (OCs) are an important environmental cause of thrombosis in young women, increasing the risk of VTE 2 to 4-fold. Ultimately, a pre- menopausal woman?s risk of VTE is multifactorial: no single inherited or environmental factor satisfactorily explains why some women who use OCs are at greater risk of a thrombotic event than others who use OCs. Assessing thrombotic risk in women before initiating OC use can help identify women who may be at higher risk of a clinical event. A risk-prediction model should account for the diverse and unique biology of each woman and how it responds to the challenge of OC hormones. The aim of this application is to elucidate mechanisms by which exogenous female sex hormones (OCs) increase the risk of VTE in premenopausal women. Over the course of the 2-phase project, we will develop and expand a model system that accounts for individual-specific and hormone-specific variables and that can be used to predict risk of thrombosis in women using OCs. Our approach is to use panomics technology to discover biology relevant to VTE in premenopausal women using OCs, and to apply panomics findings to understand the functional effects of OCs on vascular cells and blood composition. Our proposal has 4 aims, which will drive biologic discovery and functional experimentation. R61 Overview: Discovery. We will identify new genes, protein markers, and biologic pathways associated with OC use and VTE risk using ?panomic? resources (genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic) and functional cell biology and biochemistry techniques. Aim 1: Identify novel genes that contribute to VTE in premenopausal women using OCs in 3 well- characterized, case-control studies of VTE. Aim 2: Characterize effects of OCs on endothelial cell (EC) transcriptomic and proteomic responses, EC procoagulant activity, and ability to promote clot formation. R33 Overview: Validation and Functional Testing. We will validate candidate genes and proteins identified in the R61 phase, characterizing their function in an in vitro cell-based model of coagulation. We will characterize interactions between EC dysregulation and plasma hypercoagulability to promote the formation of prothrombotic clots in a blood-endothelial interface model. Aim 3: Characterize candidate genes and proteins in human populations, focusing on Aim 2 discoveries. Aim 4: Characterize the novel candidate genes identified through discovery and validation in the aims above, and determine effects of each gene on EC procoagulant activity in normal and hypercoagulable plasmas. Collectively, these aims integrate discovery and functional-analysis information to identify biologic variation that promotes OC-induced VTE. This study will yield functionally-validated molecular signals and a blood- endothelial interface model for incorporation into VTE risk prediction tools in premenopausal women."
"9543894","Project Summary/Abstract Little is known about the quality of care in free and charitable clinics (?FCCs?), which are private, nonprofit organizations that rely on volunteer, licensed clinicians and private donations to provide a range of healthcare services to uninsured and underserved patients at no cost or for a small fee. The nation's 1,400 FCCs serve more than two million patients and provide five million visits each yeari. They are estimated to reach one in every eight uninsured patients who seek care. This application proposes a two-day, invitation-only, in-person conference, ?Quality of Care in Free and Charitable Clinics: Creating a Roadmap to Health Equity,? as a mechanism to reach consensus from a diverse array of stakeholders on a set of quality measures as well as the methods by which to collect such quality data from all FCCs in a centralized, national dataset. The conference will be held in conjunction with the Annual National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics (?NAFC?) Symposium and will take place during the final day and the day after their meeting in the fall of 2018. The conference is endorsed by the leading national and state organizations representing FCCs. This national forum is the first of its kind for FCCs. The overall aims of the conference are to: discuss what is currently known about the quality of care in free and charitable clinics, identify barriers to generating knowledge on a national scale and determine ways to generate sector wide support; connect key stakeholders to reach consensus on a) a set of quality measures; and b) the practical ways to collect such measures, including those needed to address health equity, from FCCs across the United States; and cultivate new working groups to (a) implement the consensus document and b) establish the framework for integrating health equity into quality improvement."
"9527448","Project Summary/Abstract This K07 Career Development Award proposal details the rigorous training, research, and mentorship program that will provide a foundation for Dr. Brown to launch a successful independent research career. Dr. Brown?s long-term career goal is to establish a productive independent research program, with an emphasis on identifying novel biomarkers and modifiable therapeutic targets to reduce the burden of treatment-related toxicity among pediatric cancer patients. Therefore, the research goal for this proposal is to characterize early phenotypic, metabolomic, and genomic biomarkers of chemotherapy-associated neurocognitive impairment in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Although improved treatment regimens for pediatric ALL have resulted in survival rates exceeding 90%, nearly half of patients experience chronic treatment-related neurocognitive dysfunction. This proposal pursues the hypothesis that central nervous system-directed ALL chemotherapy disrupts the equilibrium of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) metabolome, manifesting as acute symptom toxicity and long-term neurocognitive dysfunction. Because genetic factors likely control the CSF metabolomic response to therapy, we further hypothesize that integrating genetic and metabolomics data will lead to the discovery of causal genetic pathways. The specific research aims of this proposal will evaluate whether: 1) Symptom toxicity during the post-induction phase of ALL therapy reflects chemotherapy-directed neurologic damage and serves as an early marker of post-treatment neurocognitive performance; 2) ALL chemotherapy induces consistent and recognizable changes to CSF metabolomic pathways involved in normal neurocognitive function and development; and 3) Genetic variation modifies individual susceptibility to neurocognitive impairment. Leveraging two NIH-funded studies with rich phenotype data and biospecimen repositories, this innovative proposal will establish one of the largest prospective investigations of neurocognitive outcomes in pediatric ALL patients. The research experience gained during the course of this study complements the proposed career development goals. Specifically, didactic training and interaction with experienced mentors in molecular epidemiology (Dr. Scheurer), symptoms research (Dr. Hockenberry), metabolomics (Dr. Devaraj), and neuropsychology (Dr. Ris) will enhance Dr. Brown?s: 1) Content area expertise in patient-reported symptoms and neurocognitive evaluation; 2) Understanding of metabolomics research methods; and 3) Proficiency in grant and scientific writing. The comprehensive career development and research plan outlined in this proposal will address key gaps in Dr. Brown?s training, provide additional research experience, and serve as a unique resource of preliminary data to support future research endeavors."
"9460534","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significance. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Aside from lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies and conservative fluid management, there are no specific therapies for ARDS. A hallmark of ARDS is injury to the alveolar epithelium, including cell death, primarily of alveolar type (AT) I cells, resulting in permeability and the influx of edma fluid, which in turn leads to refractory hypoxemia. This injury phase is followed by a reparative response during which surviving ATII cells spread onto the denuded basement membrane, proliferate, and transdifferentiate into ATI cells, thus restoring barrier integrity. Importantly, epithelial repair is a primary determinant of recovery from ARDS. Innovation. Historically, basic ARDS research has focused on the injury phase; unfortunately, therapeutic interventions designed to mitigate injury have generally been unsuccessful. Investigations into reparative mechanisms have explored ATII cell proliferation. In this proposal, we focus on ATII cell spreading onto the denuded basement membrane after the sloughing of ATI cells. This phenomenon has been recognized since the 1970s but has not been well studied in animal models. We define spreading as an increase in surface area resulting in increased coverage of the denuded basement membrane. We have developed a novel method to rigorously measure spreading of genetically-labeled ATII cells using stringent stereologic techniques. We will characterize ATII cell spreading after mild and severe injury in relationship to proliferation, transdifferentiation, and the restitution of barrier integrity. Hypothesis. Based on our preliminar data, we hypothesize that Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) 1? promotes ATII cell spreading and the restitution of barrier integrity via CXCR4/SDF1 signaling. Research Plan. Aim 1 will test whether in limited lung injury, rapid, pre-mitotic ATII cell spreading is associated with barrier restoration; in addition, after severe injury, requiring proliferation to replace lost cells, whethr post-mitotic spreading correlates with barrier restoration. Aim 2 will determine whether HIF1? is critical for spreading. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that CXCR/SDF1 signaling promotes and mediates the role of HIF1? in ATII cell spreading. We will use both gain- and loss-of-function techniques, including ATII cell specific gene deficient mice. Our primary readout will be morphometric measurement of spreading (area of alveolar surface covered) using stereologic techniques. We will directly link in vivo studies to mechanistic spreading assays in cultured primary ATII cells. Conclusion. Here, we study repair of the injured alveolar epithelium by ATII cell spreading with an emphasis on the restitution of epithelial barrier integrity, a highly cliniclly relevant outcome. These studies will identify novel therapeutic targets to accelerate epithelial repair in ARDS, ultimately promoting the resolution of pulmonary edema and clinical recovery."
"9450450","The elderly have the highest tuberculosis (TB) case rate compared to other age groups and are the most  susceptible group for TB-associated death. However, we do not yet understand the specific mechanisms by  which persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection impacts the aging immune system or conversely,  how aging contributes to the progression of latent M.tb infection to active disease. The goal of the current  project is to determine the impact of aging and inflammaging on T cell control of M.tb in mice. Similar to  humans, mice become more susceptible to developing primary TB or to reactivation of latent M.tb as they grow  older. Thus, the aged mouse model is a good model for understanding basic principles of TB infection and  immune control in the elderly. Our preliminary data show an enhanced inflammatory signature in the lung and  circulation of old M.tb infected mice, and that senescence-associated immune parameters of T cells are  elevated in M.tb infected mice as they age. To fully address both primary infection and reactivation of TB in the  elderly, the following Aims will be performed. Aim 1: Determine the impact of inflammaging on susceptibility of  old mice to infection with M.tb. Aim 2: Determine the role of senescence mediators on persistent M.tb  infection. At the completion of these studies we will have provided mechanistic information on how  inflammaging and immune senescence impact M.tb infection. This information is likely to be essential for  understanding and managing TB disease in the elderly."
"9664318","Project Summary/Abstract Well powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for celiac disease and Crohn's disease have identified numerous non-HLA susceptibility loci. Genetic fine-mapping and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) can narrow in on which genes probably account for the GWAS signals, but even after these approaches the locations of the causal nucleotide changes often remain unknown. This gap in understanding is a roadblock to targeted prevention and therapy. As developed in our prior work, mapping haplotype-dependent allele-specific CpG methylation (hap-ASM) and methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) in cells relevant to a given disease, and then overlapping these epigenetic maps with GWAS data, can help to hone in on the DNA regulatory sequences that causally underlie the GWAS signals. Our hypothesis is that this combined genetic-epigenetic mapping strategy, followed by functional assays, will be able to identify regulatory DNA sequences that contribute to celiac disease and Crohn's disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. First, we will carry out Methyl-Seq of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and peripheral blood monocytes, to map hap-ASM genome-wide. These data will pinpoint hap- ASM differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the same haplotype blocks as GWAS peaks for celiac and Crohn's. Since hap-ASM often reflects allele-specific transcription factor binding site (TFBS) or insulator occupancies, we will cross-validate our findings using an independent method, Assay for Transposase- Accessible Chromatin Sequencing (ATAC-Seq). In our second aim, we will rank and prioritize the hap-ASM DMRs based on the strength of the allelic asymmetries, ATAC-Seq overlaps, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS peak SNPs, and perform high-throughput targeted bisulfite sequencing to fine-map the top-ranked DMRs, both in the blood-derived cells and in mucosal T cells from celiac and Crohn's patients. In our third aim, to definitively test the functional roles of specific TFBS in the DMRs, we will use CRISPR to delete these sequences in Jurkat cells and in normal T cells. We will score effects of the deletions on local methylation patterns and mRNA levels of each of the nearby genes. These data will clarify our fundamental understanding of susceptibility and pathogenesis of celiac disease and Crohn's disease."
"9465235","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite overall decreases in fertility rates throughout Latin America, fertility among adolescents has remained stubbornly persistent, particularly in countries such as Honduras which experiences some of the highest adolescent fertility rates in the region as well as globally. Honduras is also one of the 5 top countries from which the most illegal immigrants arrive in the US, many of whom are adolescents. Innovative research that integrates the understanding of the demographic and geographic determinants of adolescent fertility in Honduras with cutting edge social networks and social norms research can provide important insights into the pathways by which adolescent fertility in this population can be prevented.  This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide me with experience in formal demographic methods specific to researching fertility, expertise in the social determinants of adolescent fertility, as well as methods in spatial and social demography. This training and experience will foster my development as an independent researcher who can bridge the fields of spatial and social demography with the conceptual and methodological skills of social network analysis and social norms theory. My career development plan is designed to augment my training in global public health and allow me to: 1) gain experience in formal demography, with a focus on methods specific to understanding fertility, 2) develop expertise in the social determinants of adolescent fertility in Latino populations and 3) Obtain methodological expertise in spatial demography and geo-informatics, including analysis of spatial data, and integration of spatial variables into statistical analyses. These training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, hands-on research, and mentoring from an interdisciplinary team of experts.  The overall objective of my research project is to identify the social and spatial determinants of adolescent fertility with the goal of informing future work on prevention within this vulnerable population. The project will utilize data from a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded social network study to capitalize on its extensive research infrastructure. Previous research has suggested that social norms are an important determinant of adolescent fertility in Latin America, although these norms have, up to now not been measured quantitatively. Spatial demography provides the tools necessary to understand the geographic and social clustering of norms and attitudes, through the ability to parse out the effects of each component individually. Specifically, the research aims for this K01 are to: 1) Using formal demographic methods, determine the distribution as well as the social and demographic determinants of adolescent fertility (AF) for both girls and boys on a complete population within 160 villages in rural Honduras, 2) Assess the relationship between spatial clustering and social networks as determinants of AF, and test the effect of social network cohesion on the relationship between fertility-related social norms and AF, and 3) Assess the utility of a men's participation intervention on an adolescent boy's chance of becoming a father. This project will provide the groundwork for an R01 looking at a cohort of children from the original study population to extend the measures in this study to include an understanding of how migration, and family processes impact adolescent fertility. These training and research activities will position me as one of a few researchers in the field of public health with this uniue skill set and enable me to develop an independent research career."

"9678831","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application focuses on the determination of the mechanism by which the predominant extracelluar enamel matrix protein, amelogenin, regulates initial enamel mineral formation and tissue organization. Based on extensive prior findings, our overall hypothesis is that phosphorylation of serine-16 modulates the structure and hierarchical assembly of native (phosphorylated) full-length amelogenin, resulting in its greatly enhanced capacity to stabilize amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) nanoparticles. We further hypothesize that subsequent proteolytic modification of native full-length amelogenin is required to promote the alignment and transformation of ACP to ordered bundles of apatitic crystals, as seen in the secretory stage of enamel development. We propose that enamelysin plays a critical role in this transformation process. The proposed studies are designed to provide fundamental insight into how matrix proteins, like amelogenin, control mineralization and structure in mineralized tissues. As a long-term goal, our findings should aid in the development of novel approaches for the regeneration and repair of diseased or damaged dental enamel. Given the high prevalence of dental caries, there is a tremendous need for restorative procedures that are superior to those presently available. Hypotheses will be tested in vitro, primarily using native amelogenins that contain a single phosphorylated site, and in vivo, using enamelysin null mice. Four specific aims will be carried out using multiple complementary approaches, including: dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman microspectroscopy, small angle x-ray scattering, and cryomicroscopy. Specifically: Aim 1. To determine the effect of phosphorylation on the step-wise hierarchical assembly of native full-length amelogenin, to test the hypothesis that phosphorylation affects the formation and structure of amelogenin oligomers and their subsequent higher-order assembly; Aim 2. To determine the mechanism by which phosphorylated native full-length amelogenin effectively stabilize nanoparticles of ACP, to test the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the single serine-16 site affects protein conformation and structural changes that uniquely enhance the capacity of the full-length amelogenin to interact with forming ACP nanoparticles; Aim 3. To conduct in vitro studies to test the hypothesis that the alignment and subsequent transformation of ACP nanoparticles seen in vivo to ordered bundles of hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals is induced by specific proteolytic modifications of native full-length amelogenin; and Aim 4. To verify in vivo that enamelysin plays an essential role in regulating the transformation of aligned ACP particles to ordered bundles of HA crystals, by testing the hypothesis that disordered ACP-like minerals will persist in vivo, in the absence of enamelysin, in contrast to what is seen in wild type mice."

She obtained her Masters in Clinical Investigation during her rheumatology fellowship training, and she is currently supported by the Johns Hopkins Clinician Scientist Development Award, the Jerome L. Greene Foundation, and the NIH Loan Repayment Program. Her co-primary mentors are Dr. Fredrick Wigley, an internationally recognized rheumatologist with expertise in scleroderma (SSc), and Dr. Livia Casciola-Rosen, an internationally recognized cell biologist with expertise in the identification of novel autoantibodies. Dr. Antony Rosen, the Director of the Division of Rheumatology, and Vice Dean for Research at Johns Hopkins, has significant expertise in translational investigation, and is also part of her mentoring team. Dr. McMahan created an outstanding Advisory Committee comprised of mentors and consultants who have specific areas of expertise which are relevant to the proposal. These include Drs. Michelle Petri (longitudinal cohorts) and Clifton Bingham (patient reported outcomes) in rheumatology, Dr. James Russell in neurology (autonomic dysfunction), and Dr. Jay Pasricha in gastroenterology (dysmotility). They will provide guidance specific to their area(s) of expertise. This Advisory Committee is highly enthusiastic about the proposal and fully invested in mentoring Dr. McMahan. The K23 award will enable Dr. McMahan to gain additional skills important for the conduct of translational research, develop expertise in the specific niche of neurogastroenterology as it pertains to SSc, and acquire the data and publications necessary to support a strong R01 application. In this proposal, Dr. McMahan seeks to precisely define anatomical subsets of SSc gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility using a radionucleotide-based whole gut transit study, associate the GI dysmotility subsets with traditional SSc antibodies and antibodies that target neuromuscular transmission pathways, and finally define novel autoantigens targeted by SSc sera in the GI tract. Autoantibodies in SSc associate tightly with clinical phenotypes and serve as useful markers in risk stratification. Currently, risk stratification in SSc GI disease is limited, with few autoantibodies associated with GI complications. Clearly phenotyping GI subsets will provide a platform to study disease mechanism within more homogenous SSc GI subsets and provide a framework from which to explore novel therapies in the longer term. Dr. McMahan has generated strong preliminary data, which supports the following ideas: (1) specific patterns of GI dysmotility exist in SSc; (2) autoantibodies to neuromuscular transmission pathways are present in patients with SSc and may associate with specific GI outcomes; and (3) SSc sera from patients with dysmotility recognize distinct cellular subsets in the GI tract. She has established strong inter-departmental collaborations that will provide the required support and expertise to guide her and ensure the completion and appropriate interpretation of the proposed studies. The results of these studies will create a platform for future work aimed at evaluating biological mechanism, defining biomarkers of disease activity, and exploring novel therapies."
"9439703","Scientific Abstract Idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) is a heterogeneous group of systemic disorders characterized by inflammation in the muscle and other organs. Unfortunately some patients are refractory to currently available treatment options. This has led to the exploration of novel therapies for IIM. Several lines of evidence support a role for B cells in the pathogenesis of IIM and because high levels of the B cell survival cytokine BAFF (B cell activating factor) are found in the serum and muscle of affected patients, BAFF inhibition is considered a relevant therapeutic approach. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the mechanism of action of belimumab, a potential new therapeutic for myositis, in patients being treated in the setting of a funded multicenter randomized placebo controlled clinical trial. The ancillary studies proposed here are based on the hypotheses that belimumab will target nave B cells and IFN driven autoimmune plasmablast responses and will, either directly or indirectly decrease systemic inflammation and T cell and monocyte activation. Technologies will include detailed phenotyping of immune cells including B cells, T cells and myeloid cells, analysis of immunoglobulin gene repertories, multiplex analyses of cytokines, effects of drug on the interferon signature and transcriptional profiling of selected cell subsets. Each subject will act as their own control and samples will be collected at intervals throughout the trial. Results will also be compared to those of similar assays we are performing in SLE patients to determine whether there are differences in responses to belimumab between the two diseases. These studies should shed new light on the mechanism of action of belimumab in the setting of muscle inflammation and may help us to understand which myositis patients may benefit from this therapy."
"9558264","ABSTRACT  A safe and effective vaccine providing protection from many subtypes of influenza would considerably improve public health and pandemic preparedness. Multiple potentially pandemic viruses continue to circulate and evolve in the environment causing public health concern. Preparation of vaccines for each subtype using current technologies is not cost-effective and can raise safety and biosecurity concerns if highly pathogenic strains are used. Recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) represent an intrinsically safe vaccination approach. Influenza VLPs contain viral hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and matrix or gag proteins, which self-assemble into VLPs in cell culture. VLPs morphologically and antigenically resemble influenza virions except they are non-infectious. Recombinant VLPs have advantages in safety, efficacy, and manufacturing and they circumvent problems like slow virus growth, unpredictable yields, and virus mutations during egg adaptation. In preliminary studies, we described a novel multi-subtype VLP design that co-localizes multiple HA subtypes within the same VLP particle [1, 2]. VLP that contained HA proteins from four distinct avian influenza subtypes H5, H7, H9, and H10 proteins induced specific immune responses against all four subtypes. Therefore, multi-subtype VLP design suggests the potential for a broadly protective vaccine that provides specific immunity against multiple influenza viruses of pandemic concern.  In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose feasibility study of a novel multivalent vaccine containing HA molecules from all seven zoonotic pandemic threat subtypes known to infect humans including these of avian and swine origin. In Sp. Aim 1, VLP vaccines will be prepared in the mono- and multi-subtype formats and optimized for expression of H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, H9, and H10 antigens. VLPs will be expressed using a baculovirus expression system and their structural, antigenic, and biochemical characteristics will be evaluated. The content and the potency of each HA subtype will be measured to determine optimal formulation of VLPs. In Sp. Aim 2, safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the best VLP formulation will be assessed in experimental ferret model in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Ferrets will be vaccinated with the optimized multivalent vaccine from Sp. Aim 1. Immune responses to the expressed avian and swine HA subtypes will be determined including hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralization (VN) titers. In addition, antibodies to NA, as well as IFN? responses after VLP immunization will also be determined. Vaccine efficacy will be evaluated using challenge with at least two homologous viruses. Additional homologous and heterologous challenge experiments are planned for the follow-up Phase II SBIR if approved by the Agency. If successful, this high-risk, high-reward approach can potentially result in a novel emergency vaccine protecting against multiple potentially pandemic viruses known to infect humans."
"9456605","Regulation of osteoclastogenesis and arthritic bone resorption by RBP-J  Osteoclasts play an important role not only in physiological bone development and remodeling, but also function actively as key pathogenic cells leading to musculoskeletal tissue damage and accelerating pathogenesis of diseases characterized by inflammatory osteolysis, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, periodontitis and peri-prosthetic loosening. In contrast to the extensive study of the positive regulation of osteoclastogenesis, the feedback inhibitory mechanisms that negatively regulate the magnitude of osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, especially in pathological conditions, are little appreciated. Our long term goals are to identify and understand the inhibitory mechanisms and to utilize this knowledge in development of new therapeutic approaches to diseases associated with inflammatory osteolysis. Using miRNA-seq, we have obtained the genome-wide profile of miRNA expression induced by TNF-??in osteoclast precursors. We furthermore identified miR-182 as a novel miRNA that drastically promotes inflammatory osteoclastogenesis driven by TNF-? and whose expression is suppressed by RBP-J. In our previous project period supported by a K99/R00 grant, we demonstrated and established that RBP-J is a key negative regulator that predominantly restrains TNF-??induced osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone resorption. Recently, we found that the RBP-J-regulated miR-182 promotes TNF-? induced osteoclastogenesis via inhibition of Foxo3 and Maml1, two miR-182 direct targets. Thus, suppression of miR-182 by RBP-J may serve as an important mechanism that restrains TNF-? induced osteoclastogenesis. Targeting of the newly described RBP-J-miR-182-Foxo3/Maml1 axis may represent an effective therapeutic approach to suppress inflammatory osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.  In this application, we will apply genetic approaches to further establish the role of the RBP-J-miR- 182-Foxo3/Maml1 axis in vivo and dissect underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we will 1) investigate the role of the RBP-J-miR-182 axis in vivo using genetic approaches; 2) investigate the mechanisms by which miR-182 target, Foxo3, regulates TNF-? induced osteoclastogenesis, and the functional importance of this regulation in vivo. We anticipate that our studies will provide genetic evidence and yield insight into mechanisms that restrain pathologic osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory osteolysis, and will be useful in developing new therapeutic approaches for suppressing bone resorption in inflammatory settings."
"9552694","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells (HSCs and LSCs, respectively) are endowed with unlimited self-renewal capacity. This unique ability of HSCs is responsible for sustaining lifetime production of multiple blood lineages, and HSC transplantation represents the most widely deployed regenerative therapy. On the other hand, LSCs are responsible for initiation, maintenance, and propagation of various types of leukemia. A cure for leukemia depends on the ability to eradicate LSCs after effective debulking of leukemic cells with conventional chemo- or radiotherapy. Therefore, there are imperative needs to seek in-depth understanding of how HSC and LSC self-renewal is regulated by intrinsic and environmental factors.  ?-catenin activation can be elicited by Wnt proteins or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and its roles in HSCs and LSCs remain an extensively debated issue. It is known that activated ?-catenin translocate into the nucleus where it interacts with Tcf/Lef transcription factors, thus far there is little informationon how ?- catenin activity is connected to transcriptional program changes. Based on our focused analysis on Tcf1 and Lef1, we hypothesize that Tcf/Lef and ?/?-catenin proteins constitute distinct regulatory modules in HSCs, and their respective transcriptional programs are therapeutic targets for eradicating LSCs. In the following 2 aims, we seek to systematically elucidate distinct roles of each module in HSC biology and mechanistically assess beneficial roles of PGE1 in targeting LSCs, as outlined in the figure below. Specific Aim 1. To dissect the roles of Tcf3/Tcf4 and ?/?-catenin modules in HSCs and LSCs. Specific Aim 2. To investigate the therapeutic benefits of PGE1 in treating CML.  Veterans have increased exposure to harmful environments, such as herbicides, which link to increased risk of leukemia's. Our proposed study directly addresses the needs for veterans who require leukemia treatment and blood reconstitution. Through comprehensive dissection of the regulatory roles of Tcf/Lef and ?/?-catenin in HSCs, we will acquire essential knowledge that helps improve the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation. By delving into the concept of using Tcf/Lef- and ?/?-catenin-dependent transcriptional programs as druggable targets in LSCs, we expect to devise novel therapies to treat CML and other hematological malignancies. These studies, from both basic and translational fronts, will help realize the promise of stem cells in regenerative medicine, improve the prognosis of hematological malignancies, and enhance the healthcare for veterans."
"9468570","Abstract This project is designed to obtain research training in the area of skeletal muscle biology using various genetic and molecular biology approaches. Loss of skeletal muscle mass is a devastating consequence of a number of chronic disease states and conditions. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms which regulate skeletal muscle mass and function in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions remain less understood. Recent studies have suggested that Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress-induced Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathways play an important role in skeletal muscle homeostasis and metabolic function. However, the role of the individual arms of the UPR in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and function has not yet been investigated using genetic mouse models or molecular approaches. Our preliminary studies have suggested that the IRE1/XBP1 arm of the UPR is required for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and may have a critical role in post-natal skeletal muscle growth and overload-induced muscle hypertrophy. However, the specific role and the mechanisms of action of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass remains completely unknown. To understand the role the IRE1/XBP1 arm of the UPR in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass, we will address following two specific aims. AIM 1: Establish the role and investigate the cellular mechanisms by which the IRE1/XBP1 arm of the UPR promotes skeletal muscle growth. In this aim, we will test the hypothesis that the IRE1/XBP1 pathway mediates skeletal muscle growth through a cell- autonomous and/or a non-cell autonomous manner. AIM 2: Investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the IRE1/XBP1 axis promotes muscle growth. In this aim, we will test the hypothesis that the activation of the IRE1/XBP1 arm of the UPR promotes skeletal muscle growth through augmenting protein synthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and inducing the expression of certain myokines. The proposed studies will identify a novel molecular pathway, which will significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle mass. Moreover, this project will provide me outstanding training in the field of skeletal muscle biology."
"9484263","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Presently antiretroviral therapies can preserve or restore immune function in HIV-infected people, but roughly 50% of them succumb to mild sub-dementia forms of HAND that are largely refractory to treatment. We propose innovative research to test the new hypothesis that the pathogenic processes responsible for HAND ensue early after virus transmission, they persist despite later antiviral or immune control of virus, an they may be exacerbated by opiate use. The testable translational implication of this hypothesis is that therapies targeting key determinants of the early neuropathogenesis may prevent HAND. The hypothesis will be tested in an established system of HIV infection and early cognitive impairment in immunocompetent mice inoculated with mouse-tropic HIV, EcoHIV. The natural history of cognitive disease in these mice closely models mild HAND in HIV-infected humans. HIV enters the mouse brain within 5 days of systemic infection with cognitive impairments developing 4-5 weeks later and persisting despite adaptive antiviral immunity and virus suppression. Brain pathology was normal but cognitive dysfunction correlated with suppression of synaptic plasticity genes including CaMKII and SYN2; both genes also had gene-silencing epigenetic modifications of histone 3 on their promoters as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation, suggesting stable disruption of some synaptic functions in HAND. Chronic morphine exposure and HIV synergized in causing cognitive impairment in mice. We postulate that the brain injury inflicted soon after infection of mice, before establishment of adaptive immune responses, is largely irreversible and initiates a neuropathogenic program leading to cognitive impairment. The overall goals of this application are to test this proposition, explore selected mechanisms involved, and apply the findings to identify therapies to prevent HAND. The Aims are: 1) To define virological and synaptic determinants of subclinical HAND and its progression to clinical disease; 2) To determine morphine effects in subclinical and clinical HAND; 3) To test a novel mechanism of pan- dysregulation of synaptic plasticity genes in murine HAND by chromatin remodeling and the potential role of Tat; 4) To explore interventions disrupting preclinical HAND to prevent progression to clinical disease. We believe that use of cognitive impairment as a relevant disease readout, combined with versatility of mouse experimentation, will facilitate identification of key physiological and molecular processes involved in HAND. Studies will be conducted exclusively in mice, both conventional and specific knock-out strains, principally through systemic infection with EcoHIV, with/without chronic morphine treatment through implantation of timed- release pellets. Selected disease markers identified in mice will be confirmed in archival brain tissues of MND patients stratified by opiate addiction. Timed interventions will include inhibitors of chromatin remodeling."
"9461534","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This comparative effectiveness research proposal aims to support a multicenter, prospective, randomized, NIH-defined phase III clinical trial to compare treatment protocols for decreased vision due to macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) based on results of recent randomized trials. This application is an investigator-initiated project in response to Program Anouncement Number PAR-10-207. The trial is designed to assess whether bevacizumab is non-inferior to aflibercept (with the ability to test for superiority) for the treatment of decreased vision attributable to macular edem due to CRVO. The primary aim is to test for non-inferiority based on mean change from baseline in visual acuity letter score at Month 6 for eyes randomized to intravitreal bevacizumab every 4 weeks compared with eyes randomized to intravitreal aflibercept every 4 weeks using a non-inferiority margin of 5 letters. Secondary aims are to: compare the bevacizumab and the aflibercept groups in central retinal thickness at Month 6 and change between baseline and Month 6 as measured with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT); assess Month 13 visual acuity and SD-OCT outcomes associated with different dosing strategies after Month 6 in participants who respond well (defined per protocol) to treatment; assess Month 13 visual acuity and SD-OCT outcomes associated with alternative treatment strategies after Month 6 in participants who respond poorly (defined per protocol) to treatment; compare rates of neovascular complications of CRVO in the bevacizumab vs. aflibercept groups; add to our knowledge of the safety profile of these anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications in the setting of eyes with macular edema secondary to CRVO A total of 360 participants will be enrolled at approximately 80 clinical centers. Participants will be followed fr 13 months, with assessments including Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity letter score, SD-OCT, stereoscopic fundus photography and, at selected sites, widefield fluorescein angiography. Potential adverse events will be monitored with respect to frequency and severity."
"9462153","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cornea is a highly organized, layered (lamellae) structure of collagen fibrils providing both high tensile strength to protect the eye and 70% of it refractive power. Although physical properties are closely linked to its primary optical function, its response to surgical interventions, and the results of routine eye tests such as intraocular pressure measurements, corneal biomechanics has not been a topic of major research interest. Topography, tonometry, pachymetry, and to a lesser extent optical coherence tomography (OCT), are the primary non- invasive tools used clinically for corneal disease screening and refractive surgery planning. It is clear from recent studies, however, that these systems are highly susceptible to experimental conditions and cannot be used to map fundamental corneal viscoelastic parameters. Indeed, there are no non-invasive measurement tools that can provide the information needed on every individual to develop a personalized biomechanical model of the cornea that could be used for screening, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Here we propose a tool based on optical coherence elastography (OCE) that can potentially replace pachymetry, tonometry, and topography with a single instrument, and may enable detailed, personalized models of cornea biomechanics. We will pursue a clinically translatable approach using dynamic OCE to provide spatial maps of fundamental viscoelastic properties at a spatial scale sufficient to potentially enable detailed biomechanical models of the cornea. This approach leverages several innovations developed by our team, including a phase-sensitive OCT (PhS-OCT) system providing displacement sensitivity better than 100 pm, non-contact and minimally contact mechanical stimulation approaches leveraging recent developments in acoustic radiation force (ARF) and photoacoustics (PA), and techniques to increase the inherent SNR of displacement measurements by one-two orders of magnitude using coded excitation and non-spherical lenses. The specific research plan includes five specific aims. In the first, we will enhance our current PhS-OCT system to improve spatial resolution and motion sensitivity while simultaneously decreasing overall imaging time. The initial move toward clinical translation will be in Aim 2 where both remote and non-contact methods will be investigated to launch broadband shear waves in the cornea. In parallel, we will explore a wide range of SNR enhancement techniques in Aim 3 to significantly increase overall SNR. In all cases, methods in Aims 2 and 3 will conform to all safety guidelines for both optical and ultrasonic exposure. Current methods to reconstruct the complex elastic modulus from dynamic displacement maps will be extended in Aim 4 to account for the bounded geometry of the cornea. Finally, we will study human donor corneas in Aim 5 to test whether OCE can provide maps of viscoelastic properties that can drive biomechanical models predicting corneal shape changes due to perturbations such as intraocular pressure variations and surgical interventions."
"9458110","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is the most common surgical procedure to treat degenerative cervical spine disease in the United States. Unfortunately, ACDF does not prevent degeneration of motion segments adjacent to the initial surgery (i.e. adjacent segment disease), and approximately 25% of the patients require reoperation within 10 years of the initial surgery. This study aims to identify factors that may increase the risk for adjacent segment degeneration. This research may help decrease healthcare spending by reducing reoperations and improve patient safety and quality of life. Abstract: The etiology of adjacent segment pathology following cervical fusion remains highly controversial. Adjacent segment disease is believed to result from one or more of the following distinct causes: 1) the natural history of the adjacent disc; 2) disruption of the adjacent segment anatomy due to the initial surgery; and 3) biomechanical stress on the adjacent level following the fusion. The long-term goal of our research is to reduce or prevent symptomatic adjacent segment degeneration in the spine. The overall hypothesis of this study is that adjacent segment kinematics (i.e. translations, rotations, helical axis of motion) and arthrokinematics (i.e disc deformation and facet joint surface interactions) after ACDF are determined primarily by patient-specific anatomy and iatrogenic factors, and not by increased biomechanical stress due to the fusion. A prospective longitudinal study is proposed to determine to what extent patient-specific factors (Specific Aim 1), iatrogenic factors (Specific Aim 2), and altered biomechanics (Specific Aim 3) affect dynamic cervical spine function following fusion. Participants will be C56 (n=22) and C67 (n=22) single-level fusion patients, C456 (n=22) and C567 (n=22) two-level fusion patients, and asymptomatic controls similar in age to the fusion patients (n=22). Patients will be tested prior to surgery, one year post-surgery, and three years post-surgery. At each test, participants will complete clinical questionnaires to assess pain and function, and they will perform full range of motion flexion\extension and axial rotation of the head and cervical spine while biplane radiographs are recorded at 30 images per second. A highly accurate and validated volumetric model- based tracking process and custom data analysis software will be utilized to determine intervertebral kinematics (i.e. translations, rotations, helical axis of motin) and arthrokinematics (i.e. disc deformation and facet joint surface interactions) at each test session. This prospective study will identify the factors that have the greatest effect on adjacent segment mechanics after cervical fusion. If the hypotheses are confirmed, this will provide support for increased attention to patient-specific factors and surgical technique. Alternatively, f the results indicate that adjacent segment mechanics are influenced primarily by increased stress after arthrodesis, this will provide support for increased attention to the design of motion sparing devices."
"9552667","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Gain-of-function mutations of KIT are found in a number of human malignancies, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), mast cell neoplasms, melanoma, seminoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. GIST tumors are resistant to both radiation and chemotherapy. KIT mutations are the oncogenic driver in the case of most GISTs. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib have revolutionized the treatment of advanced GIST. In mast cell neoplasms (SM), the disease is caused by mast cells harboring activating KIT mutations. SM patients are candidates for chemotherapy, but these therapies are toxic and ineffective. Melanomas with activating KIT mutations are aggressive and do not respond to chemotherapy. In all three diseases, the effectiveness of KIT TKIs is limited by primary or secondary drug resistance. Our proposal seeks to improve therapy for KIT-mutant malignancies by identifying the role LMTK3 has in positively regulating the expression of oncogenic KIT protein. Plan: Our proposal has three specific aims. In SA1, we will determine the mechanisms by which LMTK3 regulates the transcription of oncogenic KIT isoforms. In SA2, we will determine the functional domains of LMTK3 required for regulated expression of oncogenic KIT. In SA3, we will identify proteins that interact with LMTK3 and determine their role in promoting KIT transcription. Methods: In SA1, we will use a KIT promoter-reporter construct to identify regions of the KIT promoter that are regulated by LMTK3 knockdown. In addition, we will identify candidate transcription factors that mediate indirect regulation of KIT transcription by LMTK3. In SA2, we will create a series of LMTK3 mutants with mutation of specific domains (e.g. LMTK3 kinase domain) and determine which domains are required for regulation of the KIT promoter. In addition, we will identify LMTK3 phosphorylation sites using mass spectrometry. In SA3 we will use mass spectrometry and protein pull down assays to identify proteins that interact with LMTK3 and potentially regulate KIT transcription. Clinical Relevance: The care of veterans with cancer represents a significant portion of the overall Veterans Affairs Health Care budget. New cancer treatment agents that target significant aspects of tumor biology will greatly increase the quality of life o veterans with cancer. Our study of the mechanisms by which LMTK3 regulates oncogenic KIT proteins has the potential to identify new treatments for KIT-mutant cancers. These new treatments are likely to be more effective than conventional treatments and be associated with significantly less treatment toxicity."
"9467551","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma, involve pathological changes in retinal photoreceptors and/or inner retinal neurons. It is well known that different diseases can target different cell types. In principle, physiological modification must occur in diseased cells, before detectable abnormality of retinal morphology. Therefore, functional evaluation of retinal physiology is important for early disease detection and reliable treatment management. At University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), we have developed several optical approaches, including functional optical coherence tomography (OCT) and line-scan confocal microscopy, to pursue optophysiological monitoring of physiological activities using transient intrinsic optical signal (IOS) changes correlated with retinal stimulation. We propose here to validate functional IOS mapping of photoreceptor physiology at high resolution (< 50 m). Success of this project can lead to better study and diagnosis of photoreceptor dysfunction associated with eye diseases, including AMD which is the leading cause of severe vision loss and legal blindness. Our preliminary study has revealed IOS abnormalities in one mouse model with inherited photoreceptor degeneration, and in vivo confocal-IOS observation of individual frog photoreceptors have been demonstrated. Fast confocal-IOS imaging promises a high-resolution method for functional examination of photoreceptor physiology, while simultaneously providing information of retinal morphology. However, before clinical deployments of the functional IOS imaging, there are several obstacles: 1) IOS mechanism in the retina is not clear; 2) IOS imaging protocol of rod and cone systems is not developed; 3) clinical relevance between IOS modification and retinal disease is not established. These problems will be tackled in our three specific aims of this project. The first aim is to investigate physiological sources of the IOS. A hybrid confocal-OCT microscope will be employed to dissect the IOS in the photoreceptor and inner retinal cells at sub-cellular resolution. Comparative measurement of normal and aspartate-treated retinas will be used to test physiological pathways of the IOS. The second aim is to develop stimulation protocol for functional IOS mapping of retinal photoreceptors. We anticipate that selective mapping of localized (e.g., 50 m) rod and cone functions can be achieved through quantitative controls of retinal adaptation and stimulation, without the requirement of resolving individual photoreceptors. The third aim is to establish clinical potential of functional IOS imaging. One inherited photoreceptor degeneration model rd10, i.e., C57BL/6J-Pde6brd10, will be used for comparative IOS, electrophysiological, and histological study. Success criterion of this study is to demonstrate that the IOS imaging allows early detection of photoreceptor dysfunction at the time point no later than detectable structural changes in the retina. By the end of this project, ultimate imaging modality (i.e., confocal or OCT) for clinical application will be identified based on quantitative comparison of confocal- and OCT-IOS images."
"9437674","Project Summary Advanced basal cell carcinomas are caused by the inappropriate activation of the hedgehog pathway, and rapidly acquire resistance to Smoothened inhibitors. Previous work by ARO46786 developed a bioinformatic pipeline with cell line and animal model validation to identify tumor mutations in canonical pathway members such as Smoothened, increased expression of the Gli kinase atypical protein kinase C, and tumor pathway switching to another epidermal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma. Despite these findings, many of the resistant BCCs lacked identified resistance mechanisms, suggesting the existence of additional resistance pathways. Using multi- dimensional genomics approaches and a new murine model of resistant BCCs, we have uncovered two additional novel resistance pathways whose biology will be explored in the next funding cycle: 1) Hh pathway repressor mutations of the primary cilium, where the normal mechanisms that the centrosome-based organelle uses to dampen Gli activity are lost. We will study one of the most commonly mutated genes protocadherin15 by dissecting how protocadherin15 regulates hedgehog signaling and ciliogenesis and determining the fitness of protocadherin15 mutations in vivo; 2) Cytoskeletal-associated transcription, where signals from the local environment enhance Gli activity through the activation of the serum response factor / myocardin-related transcription factor complex that binds to Gli. We will dissect the functional interaction between Gli and the serum response factor / myocardin-related transcription factor complex and elucidate the upstream environmental activators that confer resistance. Completion of these aims will fill in major gaps in our understanding of tumor evolution and help develop new therapeutics for advanced BCCs and other cancers."
"9462747","PROJECT 1 - PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age associated neurodegenerative disorder, is pathologically characterized by plaques consisting of aggregated beta-amyloid (A?) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau. A? is formed by the sequential action of ? and ? secretase on the C-terminal side of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Oxidative stress has been implicated in human AD patients and several studies have shown A?-mediated oxidative stress to be central to the AD pathogenesis and progression. In addition to, or associated with oxidative stress, a reduction/dysfunction of autophagy is observed in AD. Autophagic vacuoles (AVs) that are rarely observed in neurons of healthy individuals are found to accumulate in the dystrophic and less affected neuritis in AD. Indeed, autophagy is hypothesized to be a major mechanism mediating APP turnover normally and generation of intracellular A? when dysfunctional. NF-E2- related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been implicated to be involved, not only in mitigating oxidative stress, but also an important factor in regulating and responding directly and indirectly to the changes in autophagy in vivo and in vitro. There is little work examining the role of Nrf2 in APP processing/turnover and A? production/degradation in AD with no information existing in the animal models of AD or human AD tissue. Recently, data from our laboratory found that overexpression of Nrf2 in astrocytes (GFAP-Nrf2) dramatically delays autophagic dysfunction in neurons of alpha synuclein A53T mice. This correlated with a highly significant delay in disease onset and extension of lifespan. Initial crosses of our GFAP-Nrf2 mice with APP/PS1 mice demonstrate a reduced plaque density and a dramatic reduction in intracellular APP or cleavage products. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are: Aim 1. To determine the effect of astrocytic Nrf2 overexpression on APP processing/turnover and A? production/degradation in APP/PS1 mice. Aim 2. To elucidate the mechanism involved in astrocytic Nrf2-mediated changes in APP processing/turnover and A? production/degradation in astrocyte-neuron cultures derived from APP/PS1 mice. Aim 3. To determine changes in astrocytic Nrf2 activation in possible/early and definitive/late stage human AD brain. Completion of the proposed studies will solidify the significance of astrocytic Nrf2 activation as a modulator of AD pathology."
"9451297","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Retinal degenerative disease and injury are among the leading causes of irreversible vision loss and blindness in the United States and the developed world, affecting hundreds of thousands of people every year and resulting in billions of dollars in added healthcare costs and lost productivity. Photoreceptor cell death is a consequence of many of these acute and chronic retinal diseases, leading to vision loss, and helping photoreceptors survive during the period of disease would significantly improve the visual outcomes for patients. A problem that limits the efficacy of current treatments is the lack of interventions that can specifically prevent photoreceptor cell death; therefore, a safe and potent photoreceptor protectant would provide a significant visual benefit to hundreds of thousands of people every year.  ONL1204 is a novel, small peptide inhibitor of Fas-mediated photoreceptors cell death in development for peri-operative adjunctive use in patients with acute retinal detachment (an orphan indication for which ONL1204 has received an orphan drug designation) with the goal of preventing photoreceptor cell death until definitive surgical repair can occur. This acute indication provides a rapid development pathway that lays the groundwork for future expansion of ONL1204 development for chronic indications, such as age-related macular degeneration. The product for acute retinal detachment will be a prescription drug administered by intravitreal injection.  Completion of the proposed studies in this grant will help ONL Therapeutics address final investor questions and attract the significant financial investment required for IND submission and clinical development of ONL1204. Specifically, in this grant, we will 1) determine the minimal dose of ONL1204 required for photoreceptor protection and preservation of function in large eye animal models of retinal detachment, and 2) demonstrate the GLP safety and tolerability of a single intravitreal injection of ONL1204 at clinically meaningful doses.  The studies proposed in this application are necessary for development and commercialization of ONL1204, will de-risk the program, and enable significant financial investment, allowing ONL Therapeutics to evaluate clinical POC for ONL1204 in retinal detachment."
"9624631","As many as 53% of students report experiencing depression during college, and these depressive episodes are associated with a higher frequency of academic problems, comorbidity, and suicide. Although there are effective options for treatment, the majority of individuals (>70%) do not pursue services, and even for those who do, response rates remain modest (~40-50%). As a means of increasing accessibility to treatment, internet-based interventions for depression have been developed and tested. Despite increased availability, response to internet-based interventions continues to vary substantially, and failed treatment often contributes to persistence and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high likelihood of responding to internet-based treatment would represent a major advance and address a critical unmet need.  In recent years, promising approaches for testing the heterogeneity of the treatment effects ? delineating which individuals are likely to respond to a given treatment ? have been developed. However, their use for identifying predictors of treatment response in depression remains unclear. To address this unmet need, the proposed study will test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression in a large, representative college sample (Boston Consortium of Colleges and Universities which includes 7 schools). Members of the consortium have committed to screening all incoming freshmen (N = ~14,000) through a rigorous online assessment and to offer iCBT to students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., minor or major depression). The following steps will be pursued. First, in the initial phase of the study, freshmen students from the Boston Consortium will be screened for depression through an online survey, and they also will complete web-based neurocognitive tasks probing key mechanisms underpinning depression. Depressed students will be invited to enroll in iCBT, and a predictive algorithm will be developed based on assessments across different units of analysis (i.e., clinical characteristics, neurocognitive indices) to identify iCBT responders. Second, after the development phase, an independent sample of college students will be recruited to validate the predictive algorithm. This validation phase will use clinical indicators and neurocognitive data. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data targeting key mechanisms within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will be acquired from a subset of participants. Neural data will be integrated to determine whether they improve the predictive algorithm. Third, data across independent samples will be combined, which will increase power to refine our predictive model for both acute and sustained response. In summary, there are alarming rates of depression among college students, and only a minority of students utilize mental health services. The proposed research will personalize our approach to depression treatment, which, ultimately, will improve effectiveness and better inform mental health care across college campuses."
"9462778","Core B: Clinical Core Abstract: Progress in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) depends critically on the availability of large cohorts of subjects spanning the transition from normal through preclinical AD stages, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and ultimately to early AD. The longstanding goal of the University of Pittsburgh ADRC (PITT-ADRC) Clinical Core has been to enroll these subjects, clinically characterize and longitudinally evaluate them, sample them for genetic, brain imaging, and other biomarkers, enroll them in clinical trials, and obtain their consent for the provision of autopsy tissue for further discovery. The PITT-ADRC Clinical Core has been highly successful in meeting this objective. The PITT- ADRC Clinical Core has evaluated a cohort of more than 4000 subjects since its inception, which has contributed substantially to advancement of knowledge regarding the natural history of AD, its genetic basis, the development of amyloid imaging, psychiatric comorbidities and their underlying neurobiology. During the current funding interval the Clinical Core has developed approaches to expand enrollment of individuals along the complex transition from normalcy to dementia, including Normal Control subjects, individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), individuals with impaired cognitive tests (without SCD), and individuals with MCI. At present these four groups constitute nearly 40% of our annual enrollment and comprise more than 50% of our nearly 700 active subjects. These subjects provide a critical resource for many investigations in the PITT-ADRC, especially those emphasizing imaging biomarkers (including the planned Projects 1 and 2). During the current period we have maintained our strong history of neuropsychiatric characterization of all subjects and further enhanced our rate of autopsy consent, which will support the planned Project 3. Finally, we have continued are strong track record of providing genetic samples and data on large numbers of subjects annually to the Neurogenetics Core for use in local R01s and in national and international consortia. These accomplishments have prepared the PITT-ADRC Clinical Core to maintain its productivity in the following set of proposed Specific Aims: 1) To perform evaluations at study entry and at annual follow-up of Normal Control, pre-MCI, MCI, AD, and related dementia subjects participating in the PITT-ADRC; 2) To assure maximum participation in clinical, brain imaging, and autopsy studies by providing appropriate research subject referrals and clinical services during longitudinal follow-up; 3) To provide clinical data, research subjects, DNA samples, and technical and scientific leadership to support new and ongoing research projects at the PITT-ADRC, within the University of Pittsburgh, and to support national consortium studies; 4) In collaboration with the ORE Core, to facilitate recruitment of diverse participants at the earliest end of the AD spectrum into the Clinical Core, Projects 1 and 2, and ancillary studies; 5) To provide a platform of clinical evaluation, research subjects, and data to support education and training of the next generation of dementia researchers."

Our team has specialized expertise in the assessment of war-trauma (Litz, 2007; Litz & Schlenger, 2009; Steenkamp et al., 2010; Stein et al., 2012) and has extensive experience measuring risk and resilience in the military over the life-course (Baker et al., 2012; Dickstein et al., 2010). The infrastructure created under STRONG STAR is well-equipped to effectively oversee the measurement and assessment needs for STRONG STAR-CAP. To date, we have selected outcome and predictor variables that are state-of-the-art and that provide content coverage across multiple domains while respecting Service Members' and Veterans time-and- effort constraints. We were especially mindful of the latter and chose briefer options whenever possible. Ronald Acierno at the Charleston VA Medical Center/Medical University South Carolina has organized an informal research Consortium consisting of approximately 10 non-NCPTSD investigators located at VAs throughout the US (see Table 5) who are committed to partnering with the Assessment Core and the STRONG STAR-CAP. All of the investigators have current VA, DoD, or NIH funding to support their PTSD research. A primary interest of this group is to help ensure that a set of Common Data Elements (Kaloupek et al., 2010) are collected across all DoD and VA STRONG STAR-CAP-affiliated studies (e.g., common psychological construct domains, biomarkers, etc.). They have titled their effort the Coalition of VA/DoD PTSD CAP Study Site Partners for Common Data Elements."
"9438370","Recent work demonstrates that veterans exhibit higher suicide risk compared with the general U.S. population. Despite progress in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior, the pathogenesis is poorly understood, including alterations in the neural circuitry underlying affective instability (AI) associated with suicidal behavior. AI is a trait that cuts across multiple psychiatric disorders in a dimensional manner. Two core components of AI are emotional reactivity and regulation. In addition to examining brain activity and functional connectivity in key neural circuitry underlying these two components of AI in veterans at low and high risk for suicide, this project examines affective startle modulation, a translational, psychophysiological measure mediated by the amygdala that provides a reliable, low-cost, nonverbal metric of AI components. Progress in the prevention and prediction of suicidal behavior would be facilitated by the identification of quantitative measures of AI-related neural activity/connectivity and/or affective startle modulation in response to validated unpleasant pictures and may serve as dimensional psychophysiological endophenotypes of risk for suicide. Additionally, we will examine three reliable self-report measures of AI (measuring lability, intensity, and emotion regulation) which may serve as a dimensional phenotype of suicidal behavior. Examining this combination of neural circuits, physiology, and behavior in veterans at low (non-suicidal psychiatric controls) and high risk (suicidal ideators, suicide attempters) for suicide, as well as healthy controls, holds great promise for understanding the pathogenesis of suicidal behavior, and identifying targets that may ultimately provide novel treatment intervention to reverse such pathogenic processes.  The proposed longitudinal study will focus on AI as a critical dimension that is directly associated with risk for suicide and identify the neural-circuitry disturbances that underlie emotion processing abnormalities in veterans at low and high risk for suicide. To do so, we will characterize a sample of 144 veterans, 36 in each of the four groups. All participants will receive rigorous diagnostic and clinical assessments (including several well-validated measures of AI and suicide risk), and undergo 3T functional MRI and affective startle modulation measurement while they perform passive emotion-processing/reactivity and active emotion-regulation tasks. At 6-month follow-up, all participants will repeat the startle assessment in order to examine test-retest reliability. Clinical assessment follow-up will be done at 6- and 12-months in the three patient groups. The project aims to identify behavioral, neurobiological, and psychophysiological features underlying suicidal behavior in veterans and determine whether baseline psychophysiological measures predict suicidal behavior at 12-month follow- up. Impact: Our prospective, multi-modal design promises to help uncover the mechanisms by which biological and psychological factors give rise to suicidal behavior. The proposed research may aid in prospectively identifying veterans at greatest risk for suicidal behavior."

In animal models and in humans with Parkinson's disease (PD), both a lesion or high frequency stimulation/deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN results in improvement in motor function and provides symptomatic relief. However, both DBS and a lesion of the STN could be affecting the fibers of passage. Direct inactivation of the STN neurons without affecting the fibers of passage could answer this concern. Since STN neurons utilize the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) for uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles, deletion of this gene would selectively inactivate those STN glutamate neurons and block glutamate release.  Using the Cre/loxP recombinase gene technology where a specific gene can be silenced, inactivation of the STN glutamate neurons can be achieved through deleting a targeted gene in the specific brain area by injecting AAV-Cre to mice that are floxed for Vglut2 (Vglut2flox/flox). To determine if deletion of the Vglut2 gene in the STN can be neuroprotective against DA terminal and cell loss using the neurotoxin, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), we find that a unilateral infusion of AAV-Cre-GFP (green fluorescent protein) into the STN inactivated approximately 80% of those STN glutamate neurons, as determined by GFP labeling of STN neurons. As measured by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, this resulted in a bilateral protection from the loss of DA terminals in the striatum and DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) following progressive administration of MPTP compared to the wildtype mice treated with the toxin. There was a 35% decrease in activated tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) within the substantia nigra (SN) following MPTP compared to the vehicle treated group. If VGLUT2 deletion occurred following the initiation of MPTP treatment (i.e, neurointervention), we find striatal nerve terminals recovered to nearly 80% of the vehicle treated group. Since MPTP results in a decrease in activated TrkB in the SN, deletion of the Vglut2 gene within the STN, which we found resulted in a decrease in extracellular glutamate in the SN, would allow activated TrkB in the SN to return to control levels and protect the SNpc neurons. To address a possible mechanism of this protection, we find that systemic administration of the TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, 2 weeks after the initiation of MPTP treatment (i.e., neurointervention) resulted in a blockade of any further loss of TH within the striatum due to continued MPTP treatment.  The overall goal of this project is to determine whether deletion of the Vglut2 gene within the STN initiated following (i.e., restoration) either progressive administration of MPTP or intrastriatal infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) can reverse the loss of DA within the nigrostriatal pathway in both young and aged mice. We will also determine the role of TrkB in blocking or reversing the DA depletion due to MPTP. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1.) determine if deletion of the Vglut2 gene within the STN initiated 4 weeks after progressive MPTP administration can reverse the loss of DA markers in the striatum/SN and motor function in both young and aged mice, 2.) determine if deletion of the Vglut2 gene within the STN initiated 12 days following infusion of 6-OHDA into the dorsolateral striatum can reverse the loss of DA markers in the striatum/SN and motor function in both young and aged mice, and 3.) determine if the neuroprotection from MPTP following deletion of the Vglut2 gene within the STN is due to maintained levels of activated TrkB in the SN by daily infusion of a TrkB agonist into the SN."
"9457456","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinal ganglion cell axons undergo degeneration prior to cell body loss in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Prior to degeneration, retinal ganglion cell axons demonstrate metabolic dysfunction, including ATP decreases that correlate with high intraocular pressure. This metabolic dysfunction could be a result of changes in axonal mitochondria or alterations in the provision of energy substrates from glia to axons. A critical question for therapeutic development is whether the metabolic dysfunction is intrinsic to the retinal ganglion cell axon. The long-term goal of this work is to determine the onset, progression and mechanisms of retinal ganglion axon dysfunction so that crucial intervention points for developing glaucoma therapies can be defined and prioritized. The overall objective of this proposal is to examine the causes of energy availability failure in early glaucoma and place those causes in context with structural pathology. The central hypothesis of this work is that the mechanism of metabolic dysfunction is shared by the RGC axon mitochondria and optic nerve glia. This hypothesis has been formulated from preliminary data gathered in the applicant's laboratory that suggests deficits in mitochondrial recycling, low glycogen stores and lactate transporters in glaucomatous optic nerve. The rationale for this proposed work is that investigating the source of metabolic dysfunction in glaucomatous optic nerve will identify new therapeutic targets in a disease that has no mechanism-based interventions. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: 1) determine whether mitochondria underlie the metabolic vulnerability of glaucoma by investigating ROS production and mitochondria quality control; 2) by establishing the relationship between mitochondrial respiration and degeneration; and 3) by determining how glia drive metabolic vulnerability through energy store levels and mobilization, lactate transporter expression and distribution, and metabolic enzyme activity. Overall, this work will determine the contribution of energy availability to glaucoma pathogenesis by analyzing how mitochondrial and glial-related energy substrates and delivery mechanisms are altered in optic neuropathy. Confirmation will occur through manipulation of mitochondrial quality control, reactive oxygen species levels, and energy stores to the nerve, and quantifying the resultant decrease in axon degeneration. The approach is innovative because it departs from the general perspective that energy availability and utilization are tangential to optic neuropathy. Critical intervention points to halt optic neuropathy will emerge from this analysis. For this reason, the proposed research is significant, but also because it will provide insight into the role of energy in axon degeneration generally."
"9454222","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Currently, 30 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes, with an additional 86 million being treated for pre-diabetes, and this epidemic continues to rise annually in the US. Beyond this, one in every four Veterans receiving care from the VA is being treated for diabetes and its many physical complications, with almost half suffering from diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in the US. With such a significant impact on both the US and the Veteran community, new therapeutics is required to stay abreast of the financial and physical threat posed by this visual disease. One of the most promising sources of such a therapeutic target lies within the immune system. The alteration of the immune system mediates much of the pathogenesis in diabetic complications through protein cytokine production, with IL-17 being the most prevalent cytokine in inflammatory disorders and diabetes. This research project will focus on the role of IL-17 in diabetic retinopathy, and will be the first study to characterize IL-7 producing neutrophils in diabetes. IL-17 producing neutrophils will be a major focus in this study because they are the only cell in the immune system that has an autocrine IL- 17 function that increases production of pro-inflammatory chemokines, proteinases, and reactive oxygen species, which likely play a role in diabetic retinopathy. Murine models of diabetic retinopathy will be used to test the hypothesis that diabetes alters the immune system, promoting IL-17 production by neutrophils and lymphocytes, which lead to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and development of clinical retinopathy. Further, through these studies potential therapeutic targets will be identified to immunomodulate IL-17 production and delay the onset of retinal pathology."
"9468319","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Fliser et al. identified the presence of insulin resistance in non-diabetic patients with IgA or inherited nephropathies and nearly normal values of serum creatinine and GFR, pointing out that this complication is not restricted to dialysis patients. They concluded that chronic kidney disease (CKD) rather than a specific kidney disease causes insulin resistance. However, mechanisms causing insulin resistance in CKD are unsettled: there appears to be normal binding of insulin to its receptor with the defect present in intracellular signaling. My project i based on a novel pathway I uncovered, namely that CKD stimulates the expression of a membrane- bound, tyrosine phosphatase, Signal Regulatory Protein Alpha (SIRP-alpha), resulting in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its downstream mediator, insulin receptor substrate-1. My goal is to determine how CKD-stimulated SIRP-alpha induces skeletal muscle wasting and cardiac muscle fibrosis and dysfunction.  CKD is a major concern for U.S. Veterans because of the increased morbidity and mortality it invariably causes, including insulin resistance. My long-term goal is to identify mechanisms causing insulin resistance in CKD and to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent its catabolic complications. The development of insulin resistance is not limited to CKD but occurs in obesity, type 2 diabetes and inflammatory conditions and it is tempting to speculate that results of my studies might extend to other conditions. Fortunately, the research interests of my mentors, Drs. Garcia and Mitch, are at least in part similar to my goals while Drs. Chan, Justice & Taegtmeyer can help me address experimental problems.  My Preliminary Results indicate that increased SIRP-alpha expression occurs via NF-alphaB and that silencing SIRP-alpha in muscle cells enhances insulin signaling and suppresses protein wasting. Specific Aim 1: to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRP-alpha recruits SHP2 and whether the SIRP-alpha-SHP2 complex reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1. Specific Aim 2: to study the mouse with whole body KO of SIRP-alpha by inducing CKD. My goal is to examine how CKD in the absence of SIRP-alpha affects insulin signaling and muscle metabolism. I will determine how CKD affects muscle metabolism in mice with muscle-specific KO of SIRP-alpha. Specific Aim 3: we also find increased SIRP-alpha expression in hearts of mice with CKD. Since diabetes can cause fibrosis in the heart with impaired function, I plan to determine if SIRP-alpha KO mice are protected against the development of CKD-stimulated cardiac fibrosis and decreased function.  My short-term goals are to address these Specific Aims as a prelude to becoming an independently- funded principle investigator. My long term goal is to identify mechanisms causing the complications of impaired insulin signaling and CKD. Specifically, I will enhance my knowledge and skills in didactic courses plus seminars (e.g. cell and molecular biology, grant and manuscript writing, ethics in biomedical research and translational research design). I believe I have the necessary environment to grow into a successful investigator, including strong mentorship, a world-renowned Career Advisory Committee and participation in local and national research meetings. To extend my research, I am applying for the VA-CDA and hope to develop therapies to improve the quality of life of U.S. Veterans, suffering from conditions such as CKD, type 2 diabetes or obesity that are characterized by impaired insulin signaling."
"9660795","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The intestinal epithelium (IEC) with its luminal microflora serves as an ideal experimental and medical model that merges innate immune recognition in the context of a tissue regeneration environment. Genetic predispositions that cause imbalanced microbe-host interaction may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Various susceptibility loci for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have been identified; however, their contributions to the disease mechanism remain poorly defined. A Crohn's disease susceptibility locus at chromosome 15q22 is immediately linked to RAB11A. This gene encodes a small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that regulates the recycling endosome function. The applicant's laboratory has genetically targeted the mouse Rab11a, and analyzed IEC-specific Rab11a knockout mice. Preliminary data suggested that Rab11a controls epithelial-cell-intrinsic inflammatory cytokine response to enteric microbiota. Enterocytes deficient in Rab11a in Drosophila and mouse intestines overproduced proinflammatory cytokines, and caused early-onset enteritis, higher susceptibility to inflammatory neoplasia, and premature mortality. The long- term goal is to understand how the endosomal sorting of microbial receptors in IECs influences innate mucosal immunity and microbe-host homeostasis. The objective of this proposal is to establish the molecular mechanisms, by which Rab11a endosome-mediated sorting of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), in particular TLR9, support intestinal mucosal tolerance to microbiota. The central hypothesis is that Rab11a sequesters TLR9 to an inactive endosomeal compartment and dampens unwanted immune response to enteric microbiota at steady state conditions. Information learned about IEC-mediated modulation of inflammatory cytokine production and immune response may help reduce the adverse inflammatory response in IBD. This hypothesis will be tested with 2 specific aims: (1) to establish Rab11a endosomal compartment as an epithelial-cell-intrinsic modulator of cytokine response to microbiota; and (2) to determine the mechanism of Rab11a-controlled TLR9 transport and activation in response to microbial agonists. The experiments will use the novel Rab11a conditional mouse model that facilitates inducible Rab11a deletion, IEC-specific Drosophila Rab11 RNA interference (RNAi) lines, RAB11A-depleted human colon epithelial cell lines, and in vivo perfusion of microbial agonists. The combination of these genetic models with in vivo physiologic analyses in the study of endocytic control of microbe-host homeostasis is innovative and a major step toward understanding IBD."
"9462794","Project 1: High-Resolution Neuroimaging Biomarkers for Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (Yassa) Project Summary Over five million Americans have Alzheimer's disease (AD) today. A critical goal of biomedical research is establishing indicators of AD during the preclinical stage (i.e. biomarkers) allowing for early diagnosis and intervention. Currently, the relationship between A? pathology and neuroimaging/cognitive measures during the preclinical stage is not well understood. Our project combines novel high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tools, novel cognitive testing particularly sensitive to hippocampal memory, and assessments of beta-amyloid (A?) pathology in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or florbetapir (18F) PET scans to gain a better understanding of the neural basis of preclinical AD and to identify novel mechanistic biomarkers for preclinical AD using non-invasive techniques. The goals of the project are to (1) improve our ability to detect subtle cognitive decline, (2) enhance the sensitivity of standard neuroimaging biomarkers for preclinical AD as well as develop and validate novel biomarkers using ultrahigh-resolution neuroimaging techniques, (3) test the validity of biomarker candidates in two special cohorts as models of early susceptibility (Down syndrome DS) and late resistance (nondemented 90+), and (4) deliver a proof of concept high-resolution multimodal neuroimaging platform for the ADRC to build the infrastructure necessary for establishing a high-resolution neuroimaging core. We will recruit and test a total of 90 participants: (a) Longitudinal cohort: 30 healthy nondemented participants (15 A?+ and 15 A?-) and 15 A?+ amnestic MCI participants between the ages of 65 and 85; (b) Down syndrome cohort: 15 A?+ nondemented individuals between the ages of 45 and 65; (c) 90+ cohort: 30 nondemented 90+ participants (15 A?+ and 15 A?-). A? status will be determined for longitudinal cohort via CSF (through ADRC Path Core) and for DS/90+ via florbetapir PET (through synergistic NIH R01's by Dr. Kawas and Dr. Lott). In Aim 1, we will use a set of newly developed cognitive tests of pattern separation. These tests vary mnemonic interference in the object, spatial and temporal domains. In Aim 2, we will collect high resolution structural MRI (0.55 mm isotropic), resting state fMRI (1.5 mm isotropic) and DTI (0.66 mm in- plane) to test hypotheses about changes in neural features related to pathological status (e.g. entorhinal cortical thickness, perforant path integrity, resting state connectivity between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus). In Aim 3, we will apply the techniques in Aims 1 and 2 to Down syndrome and 90+ participants to explore resistance and vulnerability to pathology in this brain network. In Aim 4, we will examine relationships between our biomarkers and pre-existing measures in the ADRC database such as genetics, blood/serum markers, and other CSF pathologies (e.g. phospho-tau). In Aim 5, we will build the infrastructure to archive and curate all new imaging data for dissemination to ADRC investigators to provide a proof of concept for a future neuroimaging core at the ADRC. Together, the Aims of this project will allow us to better understand the condition of preclinical AD and develop biomarkers that can be used in future prevention trials."
"9525295","PROJECT SUMMARY Within the skeletal muscle, Pax7+ satellite cells (SCs) are a quiescent muscle stem cell population that becomes activated upon injury and gives rise to progenitors that migrate, divide, and fuse to generate new muscles. Our understanding for these processes during muscle regeneration is incomplete. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that SCs utilize integrin signaling for specialized functions. SCs are located on the muscle fiber surface and surrounded by the extracellular matrix (ECM). The primary ECM binding receptors on the cell surface are the integrin heterodimers, composed of one a-integrin and one ?-integrin. Integrins anchor cells to the ECM and tether to the actin cytoskeleton. Upon binding to the ECM, integrins signal intracellularly, frequently in concert with growth factor receptors. SCs express many integrins, and they need to be studied systematically to understand SC biology. This proposal is the beginning of a long-term plan to explore how integrins integrate themselves into specific aspects of SC function: Aim 1: To tease out ?1-integrin-regulated signaling in SC function: We will determine how ?1-integrin's downstream effectors enhance SC proliferation and self-renewal, via cooperation with FGF2, and potentially with Wnt7a. Aim 2: To determine the role of ?3-integrin in SC function: Both ?3- and ?1-integrins can form receptors for the ECM component fibronectin, which has a role in muscle regeneration. We will determine ?3-integrin's function in the SC. Aim3: To determine the role of ILK in SC function in vivo: ILK (integrin linked kinase) is present at the basal membrane of SCs as ?1-integrin. We will decipher the role of ILK in the SC. We will also determine whether and how ILK plays a role in integrin-FGF2 synergy in SCs. ."
"9386006","Many patients in intensive care units (ICUs) don't receive high-quality palliative care. The small palliative care specialist workforce can't meet the demand of patients perceived to be at high risk for poor outcomes, ICU teams often lack the full range of palliative medicine skills, and current care often focuses on clinician-centered proxies of patient/family need to activate the delivery of palliative care. A better solution would be to develop a patient-centered, needs-targeted collaborative model of ICU- based palliative care delivery?the overarching goal of this R21. Over 300 physicians and nurses in our preliminary studies stated that they desired a care model that used collaborative practices (i.e., ICU team plus palliative care team) to target family-reported needs. However, such a replicable, scalable, and theory-driven model doesn't exist. To address this gap, we propose a 2-year prospective cohort study involving 250 patients, 275 family members, and 170 clinicians at both academic and community sites. Our multi-disciplinary team's specific aims are (1) to characterize palliative care needs (types, severity, association with outcomes) as reported by ICU family members to derive clinically relevant `need typologies,' and then, (2) using the need typologies, to develop a provisional need-targeted collaborative model of ICU-based palliative care delivery. Exploratory aims will rigorously evaluate the association between needs and popular clinical markers of poor outcomes (i.e., palliative care `triggers') as well as the impact of unmet needs on long-term family member distress. This R21 could provide a paradigm-changing care delivery model that could reduce clinical variability, an easily disseminatable mobile app tool for measuring needs and guiding the choice of clinicians most able to address them, as well as a novel intervention target that is linked to distress. Additionally, this R21 would enable our team to expediently conduct a number of `next step' trials designed to test the novel patient- and family-centered care model and its components. This proposal is innovative in its conceptual orientation, focus on scalability, mixed methods, and use of innovative technologies to personalize care. Furthermore, this R21 addresses care delivery research priorities noted by the NINR's `Innovative Questions in End of Life Research,' the 2016 NIH-NPCRC Workgroup for Surgery and Medical Sub-Specialty Palliative Care, and the National Academy of Medicine. This project is feasible because of the investigators' multidisciplinary expertise, the rich critical care and palliative care environment, and the support of the institutions involved."
"9459930","Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care."
"9442810","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to electrically heal wounds. Experiments from our own lab and others have demonstrated that electric fields occur naturally at corneal wounds and provide a powerful signal to guide migration of corneal epithelial cells. We demonstrated that the electrical signals could override other directional cues, such as injury stimulation, free edge and mechanical forces, in guiding migration of corneal epithelial sheets and large groups of cells. It is however not known how cornea wounds generate the electric signal. We propose to discover molecular generators at corneal wounds. Uncovering these generator molecules will give us molecular targets which we can stimulate to produce stronger electrical signals, and thus facilitate healing. In this proposal, we will 1) characterize calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) in corneal epithelial cells using electrophysiology and genetic models; 2) determine responses of CaCCs to injury and their roles in generating wound electric currents; and, 3) correct the defective wound electric signals (and wound healing) in diabetic rats and ANO1 knockout mice. We expect that the novel mechanisms discovered will provide fundamental insights as well as practical strategies for healing of chronic corneal wounds."
"9472251","PROJECT 3 - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder caused by interactions among multiple genetic and environmental factors. Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 increases the risk and lowers the age of onset for AD in a gene dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, the lifetime risk estimate of developing AD for individuals with 2 copies of the apoE4 allele (~2% of the population) is ~70% by the age of 85. By comparison, the lifetime AD risk estimate for individuals with two copies of the apoE3 allele is ~10% by the age of 85. Although many of the apoE4 homozygotes develop early-onset AD (EOAD) or late-onset AD (LOAD), some of them (~20%) stay asymptomatic over age 85. Understanding the susceptibility of the former group and the resistance of the latter group to AD might allow for the development of strategies to prevent or delay AD in people at risk. Like AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is also a multifactorial and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. About 20-50% of FTD cases are inherited, and heterozygous mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene are one of the most common causes of the inherited forms of FTD. However, homozygous PGRN mutations unexpectedly cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) rather than FTD. Understanding how the same mutation within a single PGRN gene causes different phenotypes depending on gene dose is crucial for unraveling the pathogenesis of both FTD and NCL and for their therapeutic developments. Because neurons cannot be obtained directly from patients, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from AD or FTD patients hold great promise as in vitro models for studying disease pathogenesis in human neurons. This proposal aims to capitalize on this promise by building on our previous efforts to generate a well- characterized repository of human iPSC (hiPSC) lines from AD and FTD patients and, by using them, to study disease phenotypes, reveal novel mechanisms, and identify new therapeutic targets. The goals of this project are to address the following two questions: (1) why are many apoE4 homozygotes vulnerable to AD pathogenesis at young ages when others (~20%) can stay asymptomatic by age 85 and over? (2) How do heterozygous and homozygous mutations within a single PGRN gene cause different clinical phenotypes, i.e., FTD and NCL, respectively? To answer these questions, we will compare the phenotypic differences (e.g., A? production/secretion and tau phosphorylation/fragmentation) among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSC lines from EOAD patients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 1); determine the transcriptomic and proteomic differences among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSC lines from EOAD patients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 2); and explore the underlying mechanisms by which heterozygous PGRN mutations cause FTD but homozygous PGRN mutations cause NCL (Aim 3). These studies should significantly accelerate AD and FTD research and related therapeutic development by enhancing our understanding of disease pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels."
"9541449","Project Summary Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a devastating malignancy of muscle that is diagnosed in hundreds of children and adults annually in the USA. Survival rates are less than 50% in patients with unresectable, metastatic, or relapsed RMS. Thus, there is great clinical interest in elucidating key molecular pathways and genetic factors that are involved in continued RMS growth, tumor maintenance, and metastasis. The long-term goal and major clinical imperative of my work is to identify new actionable drug targets in RMS. My overall objective is to determine the extent to which PlexinA1 (PLXNA1) signaling regulates RMS growth, progression, and metastasis. My central hypothesis is that PLXNA1 is an important moderator of tumor growth in a large fraction of human RMS and likely regulates proliferation and metastasis through modulation of RHOA signaling. The rationale for prioritizing PLXNA1 for further studies comes from my preliminary data showing that PLXNA1 is expressed >8 fold in metastatic lesions found in zebrafish embryonal RMS, is transcriptionally upregulated in >95% of human RMS and is required for proliferation, anchorage dependent growth and migration of human RMS cells. Roles for Plexins in modulating RMS growth have not been fully defined. Plexins are a large family of transmembrane receptors that bind semaphorins to regulate intracellular signaling. Plexins regulate integrin functions and cytoskeletal dynamics through intrinsic GTPase activity and affect the recruitment of regulatory molecules including RHOA, modulating cell adhesion, migration, cell cycle progression and transformation. Our work has already implicated RHOA as a major regulator of proliferation and metastasis in human RMS, yet the upstream regulation by PLXNA1 has not been defined. Aim 1 will assess roles for PLXNA1 in tumor onset, growth, and metastasis in the zebrafish ERMS model, testing the hypothesis that PLXNA1 accelerates RMS onset, increases tumor growth and metastasis. Aim 2 will assess roles for PLXNA1 in RMS growth and maintenance using mouse xenografts, testing the hypothesis that PLXNA1 is required for xenograft RMS growth and maintenance. This work is important because it credentials the PLXNA1 signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in RMS. Aim 3 will identify the downstream molecular pathways regulated by the PLXNA1, testing my hypothesis that PLXNA1 activates RHOA to augment proliferation and metastasis in human RMS. With respect to outcomes, this work will 1) identify the role of PLXNA1 in RMS growth and metastasis, and 2) discover novel downstream targets of PLXNA1, likely providing new biomarkers for assessing drug effects on RMS and identifying additional drug targets for the treatment of this disease. Our work will likely have positive translational impact by providing novel mechanistic insights into how PLXNA1 functions in RMS and establish this pathway as a bona fide therapeutic target in human RMS. This work is clinically important because it lays the foundation for studying new PLXNA1 inhibitory compounds in RMS including PLXNA1 blocking antibodies and small molecule inhibitors to PLXNA1-NRP receptor activating SEMA3A ligands."

"9463936","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this research proposal is to identify patients with multiple myeloma at high-risk of developing venous thromboembolism through derivation and validation of a clinical risk prediction model. The clinical utility and risk-benefit ratio of the model will be assessed with decision analysis and will aid in determining the role of the model in clinical practice. Three aims will address the overall hypothesis that a multiple myeloma-specific clinical risk prediction model will be able to accurately identify patients at highest risk of developing venous thromboembolism and thereby guide selection for use of primary thromboprophylaxis. Ultimately, this will reduce the burden of venous thromboembolism in multiple myeloma and improve outcomes while balancing a risk-benefit ratio. The three aims that comprise this proposal include; Aim 1: To develop a risk prediction model for venous thromboembolism in multiple myeloma using a nationwide cohort of patients, Aim 2: To prospectively validate the risk prediction model and determine the impact of D-dimer on model discrimination, Aim 3: To quantify the risks and benefits of thromboprophylaxis on quality-adjusted survival in multiple myeloma using decision analysis.

"9472244","CORE E: ABSTRACT This is a proposal to renew the Outreach, Recruitment, and Education Core (Ed Core) for the UCSF Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). The core supports the UCSF ADRC by ensuring a steady flow of participants with FTD-spectrum disorders, CJD, amnestic and non-amnestic AD, controls and Chinese- Americans into the Clinical Core, while providing an unparalleled educational environment for emerging researchers and early clinical trainees. The core will focus on four aims, which will continue the current efforts and extend them in the following ways. (1) For Education of Community Professionals, we will maintain outreach to Bay Area professionals with lecturing, organization of conferences, and continued contact with colleagues at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center (KPMC) in San Francisco. In addition, we will strengthen these efforts by expanding our outreach to KPMC, establishing a new relationship with the HOPE program in Marin County, and organizing a new series of recurring lectures in partnership with the Northern California Alzheimer's Association and other major Bay Area medical centers. (2) For Community Education, we will continue community lectures and maintain and update our web-based resources including our website, Facebook page, Twitter feed, and Blog. In addition, we will improve our website by creating a section on young-onset/non-amnestic subtypes of Alzheimer's disease. (3) For Outreach to Chinese Americans, we will continue our clinical consultation program in Chinatown and partnerships with community organizations to educate laypersons and health providers serving the Chinese American community about neurodegenerative disease. In addition, we will further facilitate the ability of Chinese Americans to participate in research by translating the new UDS neuropsychological battery into Chinese and making these materials available to all centers via NACC, and developing the EXAMINER-C as a frontal assessment battery for Chinese individuals by creating preliminary normative data. (4) For Research and Clinical Training at UCSF, we will maintain our fellowship training programs with a rich set of clinical and experimental resources and continue to welcome medical early clinical trainees to our month long behavioral neurology rotation. In addition, we will enrich and expand these experiences by establishing a new statistical seminar for our clinical research fellows and opening the neurobehavioral rotation to students and postdoctoral fellows in the UCSF Neuroscience program."
"9472204","The human gut microbiota undergoes compositional changes during pregnancy, and these bacterial changes have been shown to influence maternal metabolic responses; however, how this occurs is unclear. Part of these maternal metabolic changes include enhanced glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and an expansion of pancreatic ? cell mass (BCM). Providing a potential understanding of how the gut microbiota mediates this maternal response, we have new data suggesting a relationship may exist during pregnancy through the ? cell-expressed free fatty acid receptor-2 (Ffar2), where this receptor is activated by nutrients derived from the gut microbiota, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Exploring this potential relationship, we have observed the following; 1) Ffar2 expression is altered in mouse islets by gestational insulin resistance, which suggests FFA2 may help in ? cell adaption during pregnancy, 2) mice with a null mutation of FFA2 (Ffar2-/-) exhibit impaired glucose tolerance, lower insulin levels and diminished BCM expansion during pregnancy, 3) SCFAs, the primary ligands for FFAR2, are altered during pregnancy within the gut and blood of mice, and finally 4) the bacterial species in the mouse gut microbiota are influenced during pregnancy, as observed for humans. Because of these compelling data, our goal in this proposal is to dissect and test how the gut microbiota, SCFAs, and Ffar2 on ?-cells are contributing to gestational glucose homeostasis during pregnancy. First, through a novel mouse model created by our group, a ? cell specific knockout of Ffar2, we will explore how ? cell expressed Ffar2 mediates GSIS and BCM changes during pregnancy. Next, we will identify the key fermentative gut bacterial taxa and the metagenomic profiles of these taxa that contribute to SCFA level changes during pregnancy. And finally, we will test the collective relationship between gut microbiota, SCFAs, and ? cell expressed Ffar2 by modulating the gut microbiota through germ-free conditions, testing the influence of the gut microbiota on glucose homeostasis in our ? cell specific knockout of Ffar2. If this novel relationship exists during pregnancy, we will reveal a new paradigm in gestational glucose metabolism, and provide new insight into how the gut microbiota influences host metabolism. !"
"9666656","This proposal will help to improve the accuracy of pathologists diagnosing melanoma and melanocytic lesions. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer, and ~1 in 50 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone. Based on previous work, our research team has noted substantial and frequent diagnostic errors in interpreting melanocytic lesions; pathologists disagree in up to 60% of cases of invasive melanoma, which can lead to substantial patient harm due to misdiagnosis.  Our proposed work leverages information naturally embedded in digitized slides (whole-slide digital images of glass slides) to use computer technology to improve the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. Using data from a currently funded NIH study that has documented substantial and concerning diagnostic errors from pathologists, we will digitize and study a well-characterized set of 240 skin biopsy cases that includes a spectrum of benign to invasive melanoma diagnoses. Each biopsy case has been independently interpreted by many practicing U.S. pathologists and also a panel of international experts in dermatopathology, providing a uniquely rich clinical database that is the largest of its kind.  In this project, novel computational techniques will be used to analyze digitized slides for the purpose of assisting in the pathologic diagnosis of melanoma and related skin lesions. These techniques include the detection of both cellular-level and architectural features for use in feature-based classification, and exploration of deep neural networks that operate on raw pixel data for the difficult task of mitosis detection. In addition, a machine learning approach will be applied to the digitized slides to determine the histopathological characteristics associated with human diagnostic errors. Our specific aims are as follows:  1. To design and implement image analysis algorithms to detect clinically important features in digitized slide images of melanocytic skin lesions.  2. To develop classification systems that can categorize digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes: benign; atypical lesions; melanoma in situ; invasive melanoma stage T1a; and invasive melanoma stage ?T1b.  3. To investigate the characteristics of digitized slide images associated with diagnostic errors by human pathologists using data from both expert and community pathologists.  In our proposed study, we are innovatively merging data on how pathologists review and diagnose slides in a clinical setting with image analysis algorithms. This technology has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy of pathologists by providing an analytical, undeviating review to assist humans in this difficult task."

"9520587","Project Summary/Abstract The ability to treat breast cancer using patient specific regimens is not yet feasible. For example, oncologists use prior clinical trials data to recommend multiple therapies based upon features of the tumor and clinical stage of the patient. However, these data are averaged from large groups of patients that are then applied to each individual. Therefore, oncologists end up treating the majority of patients with multiple therapies knowing from past clinical trials that most patients do not need these additional therapies, resulting in overtreatment. For early stage breast cancer, this is because there is no reliable method to identify patients that truly have microscopic residual disease after primary therapy versus those that are already cured. The proposed project addresses this conundrum. The research team will employ the newer technologies of digital PCR (dPCR) and next generation sequencing (NGS), to reliably detect and quantify plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) molecules shed into the circulation from cancer cells. They have already demonstrated the ability to detect microscopic residual disease using these technologies in early stage breast cancer patients. The team proposes an ambitious project to address unmet needs in early stage (curative intent) breast cancer, to ultimately determine who truly needs additional therapy vs. those patients that are already cured. They propose to evaluate Stage II/III breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and define whether absence of ptDNA after NAT can predict for complete elimination of tumor cells at the time of surgery, termed a pathologic complete response (pCR). Three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1) Identification of somatic mutations in early stage breast cancer using NGS. The team will test the feasibility of using plasma DNA to identifying tumor specific mutations in Stage II/III breast cancer patients prior to any therapy. The success of this aim will preclude the need for obtaining diagnostic tissue samples for NGS, which are often exhausted or unobtainable. Aim 2) Detection of somatic mutations in plasma using dPCR. The successful detection of mutations in preNAT blood by dPCR will validate mutation markers for serial testing of blood samples for each individual patient. Aim 3) Predictive value of ptDNA for residual disease and pathologic complete response (pCR). Using dPCR, the team will determine whether absence of ptDNA in blood after NAT but prior to surgery predicts for pCR. The success of this study will set the stage for future trials to determine if patients without detectable ptDNA after NAT can safely forego surgery, similar to the paradigm shift in using sentinel lymph node biopsies to avoid axillary dissection. Additionally, the presence of ptDNA after NAT and surgery may identify a subset of patients with significant risk for future recurrence, which could serve as a platform for future clinical trials. Ultimately measuring ptDNA will enable individual therapy options and change the current practice of overtreatment in early stage disease."
"9452963","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Photoreceptor outer segment membranes, the site of initial photon capture initiating phototransduction, undergo renewal with total replacement occurring at ten-day intervals throughout life. A challenge to cellular integrity concerns the post biosynthetic delivery of replacement proteins from the inner to the outer segment over the photoreceptor lifetime. Complex trafficking pathways require multiple components, e.g., UNC119 acyl-binding proteins, small GTPases such as ARL3, and GAP proteins like RP2. Mutations in UNC119 and RP2 are associated with cone-rod dystrophy and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, respectively. This application will: i) identify pathways for transducin transport in rods, particularly after light-induced translocation; and ii) generate knockout models for NPHP10 and devise gene replacement therapies for NPHP5 and NPHP10 LCA."
"9551517","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Mixed Lineage Kinase 3 (MLK3) is a stress-activated MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase (MAP3K) member, and its biological function is still elusive. While dissecting the signaling pathway mediated via MLK3, we observed a robust phosphorylation of a prolyl isomerase Pin1 by MLK3 on Serine138 residue. These results were significant as Pin1 is considered an important oncogene and is overexpressed in almost all types of cancer. The Pin1 specific inhibitors are under development to treat cancer. Remarkably, the phosphorylated Pin1 (i.e. Pin1S138E mutant) was localized in the nucleus, suggesting that this phosphorylation-dependent translocation of Pin1 could have some physiological function. Corroborating our hypothesis, the phosphorylated Pin1 was overexpressed in tumors but not in normal matching tissues and p-Pin1 was necessary for cell cycle progression. Therefore, we ventured to find the targets of p-Pin1 that could promote tumorigenesis. We identified that p-Pin1 (i.e. S138E) was able to up regulate mRNA of Gli1, a transcription factor in the Hedgehog pathway, whose dysregulation has been linked to cancer, including pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, we also observed that mRNA of a chemokine, CXCL5 was downregulated in MLK3 knockout liver, suggesting that MLK3 is necessary for CXCL5 expression. These results were quite intriguing because Gli1 activation/dysregulation has been implicated in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis and also reported that inhibition of Hedgehog pathway overcomes gemcitabine (common drug for pancreatic cancer) resistance in animal model. More recently, CXCL5 and its receptor blockage in pancreatic cancer cell lines was shown to inhibit the pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDA) cell growth and CXCL5 produced by pancreatic cancer cell lines was able to promote angiogenesis. Our preliminary investigation further revealed that MLK3 activity was regulated by CXCL5 in pancreatic cancer cell lines and the MLK3 activity correlated with the expression levels of CXCL5 in these cell lines. We also observed that in primary human pancreatic tumors, the MLK3 activities directly correlated with the expression levels of Pin1 and Gli1 in tumors. Based on these results, we conceive that the available MLKs inhibitor, CEP-1347/CEP-11004 or in combination with Pin1 inhibitor, should induce cell death in pancreatic cancer cells? Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in pancreatic cancer cells, MLK3 activates Pin1 and its downstream Gli1, leading PDA. Therefore targeting MLK3 or other MLKs along with Pin1 inhibition could abrogate pancreatic tumors. To achieve our goals, we will determine that: (1) activation of Gli1 by MLK3-Pin1 axis promotes pancreatic cell tumorigenesis, (2) disruption of MLK3- Pin1 axis attenuates pancreatic cancer cell tumorigenesis; and (3) we will determine the mechanism of MLK3, Pin1 and Gli1 activation in pancreatic cell tumorigenesis. It is expected that by defining the role of MLK3 in Pin1 and Gli1 activation in pancreatic tumorigenesis, we might control/treat pancreatic cancers by using available inhibitors of this pathway. Interestingly the specific inhibitor of MLK3 family, CEP-1347 has been used in clinical trials for treating neurodegenerative diseases and specific Pin1 inhibitors are under development for cancer treatment. It has also been suggested that MLKs inhibitors might serve as a treatment for specific type of cancer, underscoring our unexpected novel results related to MLK3 role in pancreatic cancer. Taken together, the present study will lead to the identification of new prognostic factors and specific targeted therapies for difficult to treat and lethal pancreatic cancer."
"9412782","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Alcoholism and insomnia are highly prevalent in Veterans. Alcoholism is estimated to occur in about 6.4% of Veterans. More recent estimates of alcohol misuse range from 11.8% in OIF Veterans to 21.8% in OEF/OIF male Veterans. Insomnia is estimated to occur in about 28% of active duty military personnel (from the Millennium Cohort Study), and up to 77% of Veterans seen in a VHA primary care experience clinically significant levels of insomnia. Insomnia is also highly prevalent in patients recovering from alcoholism with as many as 70% of such patients complaining of sleep initiation and/or maintenance problems. These prevalence rates are 2-7 times higher than that of the general population. The direct consequences of insomnia include sleepiness, fatigue, irritability, diminished work performance and impaired interpersonal functioning. The long- term sequelae of insomnia include risk for new-onset and recurrent psychiatric illness, and in the context of alcoholism, greater intensity of alcoholism and increased risk for relapse in abstinent alcoholics. At present, there are nine studies which evaluate whether insomnia represents a modifiable risk factor for relapse of alcoholism (2 investigating trazodone, 3 investigating gabapentin, 1 investigating ramelteon, and 3 investigating a modified form of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia [CBT-I]). The results from these studies are variable. The CBT-I investigations show the most promise in terms of improved sleep, but there is no clear evidence that improved sleep has protective value against pathological drinking. Accordingly, CBT-I (n=30) will be evaluated and compared to the Quasi-Desensitization Therapy (QDT) (n=30) in a sample of veterans who have been sober for at least one month (but less than one year). The study cohort will be further stratified into those who do (n=30) and do not (n=30) have a first-degree family history of alcoholism. Familial alcoholism is taken into account, as this may represent a unique factor that contributes to insomnia severity and/or treatment outcome. All subjects will complete a 2-week baseline recording period followed by weekly CBT-I/QDT sessions for 8-weeks. CBT-I will be conducted according to a standard protocol. Weekly 1-hour sessions (individual format) will be used to deliver the four components of CBT-I (Sleep Restriction, Stimulus Control, Sleep Hygiene, and Cognitive therapy [sleep-related de-catastrophization]). Treatment will be followed up with two evaluations at 3 and 6 months post-intervention. All subjects will complete the Insomnia Severity Index, daily sleep diaries, and the alcohol-related measures for a 2-week baseline, for the intervention period, and for two follow-up intervals after treatment completion at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measures are insomnia severity (as assessed with the ISI) and percentage days abstinent (as assessed using the Timeline Follow Back measure). In addition, health and mood will be tracked using the Short Form-12 (SF-12) item scale, the BDI-II, PHQ9, STAI, and the GAD7. The combination of these measures serve to test the hypotheses that standard CBT-I can be applied successfully in patients recovering from alcoholism and that successful treatment of insomnia will be associated with better clinical outcomes in relation to alcoholism. Finally, family history data will be assessed on an exploratory basis to assess differences in baseline insomnia and objective sleep, as well as outcomes for the insomnia, alcoholism, treatment adherence, and/or treatment outcome. Objective sleep will be preliminarily assessed with in-laboratory polysomnograms of seven subjects with and without familial alcoholism (n=16). It is hypothesized that CBT-I in abstinent alcoholics will lead to 1) significantly superio sleep-related outcomes as compared to QDT, 2) pre-to-post treatment effect sizes that are comparable to the meta-analytic norms, 3) a larger percentage of days abstinent with at least a trend toward fewer relapses, and 4) better overall health and mood. If these findings are achieved and replicated, it will suggest that insomnia treatment should be a standard component in the management of alcoholism and that CBT-I is an ideal management approach for this co-morbid insomnia."
"9551500","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and in our veteran population. During the last funding cycle, we have identified several atrial-specifi ion channels including Cav1.3 (1D) L-type Ca2+ channel and small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK or KCa2 channels) which play critical roles in the function of atrial myocytes as well as sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Of clinical importance, we have demonstrated that SK channels are expressed and contribute significantly to the repolarization process in human atrial myocytes.  For the current competing renewal application, we will focus our effort on the subcellular regulation of Ca2+ channels in ventricular myocytes and pacemaking cells. Embedded in our findings and the proposed project are relevant paradigm shifts that may be exploited in developing specific drugs for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Specifically, we will test the central hypothesis that there is isoform-specific differential regulation of L-type Ca2+ current in ventricular myocytes and pacemaking cells by distinct isoforms of adenylyl cyclases (ACs). We will utilize new emerging techniques of live-cell imaging coupled with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) sensors to directly decipher the distinct subcellular localization and activities of different isoforms of ACs not only in ventricular myocytes but also in pacemaking cells. Indeed, we will take advantage of multidisciplinary techniques including in vivo and in vitro electrophysiologic recordings, live-cell imaging, and molecular modeling to determine the subcellular regulation of Ca2+ channels through distinct isoforms of ACs. Our proposed studies will expand our understanding of the specific subcellular localization and regulation of individual Ca2+ channels and how they might coordinate to mediate normal cardiac rhythm in vivo. Understanding the molecular and subcellular regulation of Ca2+ channels in the heart will set the stage for a new and more mechanistic approach for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and SA and AV node dysfunction, a common problem encountered in our veteran population."
"9469792","Project Summary Funds are requested to provide partial support for the 8th International Symposium on the Biology of Vertebrate Sex Determination to be held in April of 2018. This meeting has been held at 3-year intervals since its inception in 1997. This unique meeting is attended by the entire international field working on diverse vertebrate systems, including amphibians, fishes, birds, reptiles, monotreme, marsupial, and eutherian mammals, including domesticated species, mice, and humans. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the advances made in so many diverse vertebrate systems. Therefore, the objective of this meeting is to exchange information, using a comparative approach to advance our understanding of the process of sex determination, sex differentiation and disorders of sexual development. Many collaborations resulted from the first seven symposia: reagents were exchanged, experiments planned and new ways of looking at sex determination discussed. ~70% of the participants of the 7th symposium were junior scientists, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and assistant professors, providing a unique opportunity for interactions with senior leaders in the field. We expect the 8th symposium to be as productive and stimulating as the previous ones."
"9663642","PROJECT SUMMARY Microfluidic devices have been successfully used in biological assays, especially for assays involving bacteria and cells. While important studies involving bacteria and cells are still in progress in many research laboratories, many devices are now being developed such that tissues, and even organs, can be cultivated on these devices for more realistic biological studies. For nearly a decade, the PI has been culturing endothelial cells in microfluidic devices and investigating the interactions of the endothelium (as a vessel wall tissue) with a flowing stream of blood components such as red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets. In this application, the investigative team wishes to expand upon these tissues to include components of pancreatic tissue (?-cells, the cells responsible for secreting the well-known biological peptide, insulin). One of the major objectives of this application is to measure and understand cell-to-cell and tissue-to-tissue communication between the ?-cells, the bloodstream, and the vessel wall (endothelium). Unfortunately, it has been shown that affecting ?-cells by knockout or knockdown approaches often adversely affects the cell as a whole, thus making it difficult to distinguish key factors in the biological pathways. In this application, the investigative team will develop a novel platform based on 3D-printing of fluidic devices hosting membrane inserts with modified pores that selectively captures molecular messengers traveling through the bloodstream from one tissue to another. We will also develop a new that enables intravenous (IV) injections of drug therapy candidates into a flowing stream of blood or blood components to bridge results into a full in vivo study using animal models of type 1 diabetes (T1D). We hypothesize that the development of this novel platform for studying cell-to-cell and tissue-to-tissue communication can be used as a bridge to in vivo studies involving a possible additional replacement therapy for people with T1D."
"9442599","Although endogenous neuropeptide transmitters play critical roles in the reinforcing effects of ethanol consumption and the aversive effects of ethanol withdrawal, we have a poor understanding of mechanism(s) underlying central neuronal release of neuropeptides. This gap in our knowledge critically undermines our abilities to elucidate the biological effects of ethanol (EtOH), as 1) multiple studies have demonstrated that acute and chronic EtOH induces release of neuropeptides in brain regions associated with EtOH reinforcement and withdrawal-induced aversion, and 2) one of the very few medications (naltrexone) commonly used to treat EtOH craving is assumed to act by antagonizing effects of endogenously-released opioid peptides. Multiple behavioral studies document involvement of endogenous neuropeptides in response to stress, drugs and other behavioral states, but we still know very little about the physiological mechanisms underlying neuropeptide release. Howevever, this knowledge could significantly enhance our ability to create novel pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown enhanced release of neuropeptides in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) by acute EtOH exposure. In addition, several studies have shown persistent release of specific peptides following withdrawal from chronic intermittent EtOH; these peptides may mediate the ?anxious-like? withdrawal behaviors. However, our current preliminary data suggest that many conventional notions of peptide release may be inaccurate or incomplete; specifically, high-frequency activity is neither sufficient nor necessary for peptide release. We have recently begun exploring potential cellular phenomena that could regulate peptide release and our preliminary data demonstrate that we can relatively selectively induce release of the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) using optogenetic methods. In addition, we have characterized the potential role of the BK potassium channel in mediating EtOH effects. Proteomic analysis has shown that the BK channel is linked to the intracellular enzyme dynamin-1, a protein essential for mediating peptide release. We hypothesize that in contrast to fast synaptic transmission at axonal terminals, central neuropeptide release is mediated by a mechanism dependent on both the BK channel and dynamin-1.  Because of the wealth of preclinical data implicating endogenous neuropeptides in effects of ethanol consumption and the clinical experience with naltrexone (which acts by blocking effects of endogenous opioid peptides), we believe that mechanistic studies of the physiological and ethanol-induced release of peptides in the extended amygdala may facilitate development of novel pharmacotherapies for the treatment of alcoholism."
"9552674","?    DESCRIPTION:        PROJECT SUMMARY: The primary goal of our research is to characterize the role of the lipid mediator Platelet-activating factor (PAF) in skin pathophysiology. PAF generates an acute pro- inflammatory response and delayed immunosuppression. Our previous studies have demonstrated that PAF is involved in the acute inflammation and mediates the delayed systemic immunosuppression following treatment of skin with high doses of ultraviolet B radiation. We have recently shown that photodynamic therapy (PDT) which consists of a photosensitizing agent followed by irradiation with blue light (which is used to treat pre- and skin cancers) produces high levels of PAF in keratinocytes in vitro and murine skin in vivo. More importantly, PDT treatment was found to induce systemic immunosuppression only in wild-type, but not in mice lacking PAF-receptors (PAF-R). Given that PDT is associated with significant treatment-limiting acute side effects of a painful sunburn-like reaction, and that the immunosuppressive effects of PDT might explain long-term failure rates of this modality, understanding the mechanisms of PDT actions has clinical significance. The planned studies take advantage of our expertise and tools we have used to define the role of PAF in UV responses. Three aims will test the hypothesis that PDT generates PAF which results in both an early pro-inflammatory response as well as delayed immunosuppressive effects. The first aim will explore the consequences of PAF-R and the PAF-metabolizing enzyme serum PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) loss-of-function to define the role of PDT-generated PAF in the sunburn-like acute side effects. The role of tumor necrosis factor and cyclooxygenase-2 as downstream effectors of PAF-R signaling will be defined. The second aim will test the effectiveness of experimental PDT therapy in wildtype and PAF-R-deficient mice that have underwent a UVB carcinogenesis protocol to generate actinic damage. The ability of PAF-R antagonists and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors to modulate the effectiveness of experimental PDT will be defined. The third aim will use human skin explants and human subjects undergoing PDT to define if PAF is generated and the effects of topical PAF-R antagonists on PDT acute effects. Given that PDT-generated PAF could explain both the acute inflammation and delayed immunosuppression associated with PDT, these studies have clinical importance and could result in novel therapeutics to improve the effectiveness of this modality commonly used in our veteran population."
"9548552","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        An estimated 39.6 million people, including 8.5 million US Veterans (43%), are elderly and at risk for developing chronic sleep disturbance. Chronic sleep disturbance is associated with a number of negative health outcomes including cognitive decline, increased risk of fall, anxiety, and depressive disorders, contributing to the poor quality of life. The proposed research program will use a multi-disciplinary approach to examine: a) if a physiological decline or dysfunction of the preoptic hypothalamic (POAH) sleep- regulatory systems contribute to chronic sleep disturbance in aging; b) if chronic POAH inflammation and nitrosative stress in aging contribute to sleep-disturbance, by adversely affecting sleep-regulatory systems; and c) if sleep disturbance in aging can be mitigated by anti-inflammatory measures. Specific aim-1: will determine if the functional activity of sleep-regulatory median preoptic nucleus (MnPN) and ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) neurons decline with aging. We will compare in young vs. old rats: a) changes in discharge activity of sleep-active MnPN and VLPO neurons to spontaneous and homeostatic sleep cues (experiment-1); and b) c-Fos expression in VLPO and MnPN GABAergic neurons after different sleep pressures and sleep amounts (experiment-2). Specific aim-2: will determine if the MnPN and VLPO sleep-regulatory systems exhibit evidence of increased inflammation, nitrosative stress, and neuronal damage with aging. We will compare in young and old rats: a) microglia activation, and expression of TNF-alpha, iNOS, nitrotyrosine (markers of nitrosative stress), and markers of senescence, apoptosis and neuronal damage in the MnPN and VLPO GABAergic neurons, by immunohistochemistry (experiment-3); and b) levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, iNOS, and nitrotyrosine by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blots as well as NO metabolites (nitrates and nitrites) and cytokine release in the MnPN and VLPO by ELISA and flourometry (experiment-4). Specific aim-3: will determine if chronic MnPN and VLPO inflammation contribute to sleep disturbance, by adversely affecting their sleep-regulatory neuronal systems. We will quantify: a) if chronic MnPN and VLPO inflammation, induced by local LPS infusion, in young rats produces sleep disturbance and immuno- histochemical changes in GABAergic neurons, that are typical of old age (experiment-5); and b) if chronic suppression of inflammation within the MnPN and VLPO, by focal infusion of minocycline, an inhibitor of microglia activity and a selective scavenger of peroxynitrite, reduces nitrosative stress in GABAergic neurons and improves sleep-wake organization and sleep continuity in aged rats (experiment-6).  The proposed research program is conceptually innovative and will generate novel and fundamental data about the functional status of the POAH sleep-regulatory systems in aging. A better understanding of how CNS aging affects sleep-regulatory systems and the mechanism by which inflammation pathologically affects sleep-wake function may contribute to the development of novel preventative and therapeutic options for optimizing sleep health in the elderly including Veterans."
"9480797","CANCER ANIMAL MODELS SHARED RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT The Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource (Mouse SR; Categories 1.02, 1.04, 1.06) of Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) was established in 2012 to promote cancer discovery by providing expertise to Winship investigators in the development and analysis of animal models of cancer, with a particular focus on genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Since its inception, Mouse SR has supported investigators across all four Winship programs (Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics (CGE), Cancer Cell Biology (CCB), Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics (DDT), and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC)) with genetic mouse models of colon, prostate, breast, pancreatic, and lung cancer and brain tumors. The number of Winship members actively using Mouse SR increased during the current funding period from seven to twenty- one individual investigators. In 2014, Winship appointed a new Mouse SR Director and added an additional full- time staff member. Mouse SR has expanded its services to include cell-line and patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models and has acquired an IVIS Spectrum pre-clinical optical imaging system. The IVIS Spectrum is capable of detecting high-resolution bioluminescent and fluorescent sources deep within the animal and allows for longitudinal monitoring of therapeutic responses in vivo. Mouse SR provides a significant cost savings to Winship investigators by offering a source of centralized expertise and equipment. Future goals of Mouse SR include establishing immune-competent syngeneic models to support testing of immunotherapies and to establish a bank of GEMM-derived cells lines for rapid in vitro compound screening prior to in vivo studies. During the current funding period, Mouse SR has supported multiple grant applications and awards, contributed to high- impact publications, and supported the successful submission for two new multi-PI R01s and a U01 award.

Data management support includes comprehensive data management and dissemination of data arising from the Uniform Data Set (UDS) and all ADRC projects. DMSC personnel are responsible for the development of National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) approved collection forms, maintenance of the ADRC database, and the timely transfer of accurate data to the NACC. Strong statistical design and efficient data analyses are also crucial components to achieving the scientific goals set forth by the UCI ADRC. DMSC members work closely with ADRC investigators to refine scientific hypotheses and develop analytic plans that are both appropriate and efficient for meeting the scientific needs of each investigator. DMSC statisticians are key collaborators in conducting studies and interpreting and reporting results. While a large portion of effort from DMSC faculty is devoted to providing collaboration and service to ADRC investigators, the DMSC also emphasizes the development of independent research programs among members of the DMSC. These DMSC-specific research endeavors not only increase the intellectual contribution of the DMSC to the scientific community at large, but will also lead to improved methods for collecting, entering, and analyzing complex data in the study of AD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. ?"
"9472241","CORE B: ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The overarching goal of the Clinical Core is to characterize the behavioral, cognitive, motor, neuroimaging, proteomic and genetic features of ADRC subjects in novel, multidisciplinary ways, and facilitate enrollment of subjects in studies of normal and abnormal aging. The specific aims of the Clinical Core are to 1) Recruit, evaluate, and longitudinally follow cohorts of normal elderly (n=200), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n=120), mild AD (n=120), frontotemporal dementia-spectrum (n=120), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD; n=10); 2) Work with the Education Core to recruit, evaluate, and longitudinally follow 120 Chinese- American patients and controls; 3) Provide clinical data and well characterized subjects for research on aging and neurodegenerative disease; and 4) Work closely with the other UCSF ADRC Cores to provide integrated and comprehensively characterized subjects for research, including biological samples for genomic and proteomic research, structural and functional neuroimaging, and amyloid biomarkers. All subjects will be evaluated using the UDS plus several neurological, cognitive, and personality measures specific to UCSF to better understand the heterogeneity of and overlap between dementias, improve our ability to capture the very earliest signs of neurodegeneration, study the transition from normal aging to MCI, and elucidate underlying neural networks and mechanisms.."
"9457299","Summary: Project 1 Prusiner There is increasing evidence from both cell culture and animal models that both the A peptide and the tau protein become self-propagating in Alzheimer's disease (AD), initiating a cascade of neurodegeneration that spreads throughout the brain, indicating that A and tau are prions. Thus, the molecular events underlying the pathogenesis of AD and tauopathies are reminiscent of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), in which the misfolding of the prion protein (PrP) into a self-templating isoform termed PrPSc initiates disease. However, to better understanding the structural and biochemical properties of self-propagating protein aggregates in AD requires the creation of cellular and animal bioassays capable of rapidly ascertaining the presence of these prions. We propose to study three different human prions composed of PrPSc, A or tau, each of which cause age-dependent neurodegeneration. In these studies, we will take advantage of new paradigms that allows us to monitor disease progression and to diagnose neurodegeneration in living mice, in addition to novel cellular assays, greatly accelerating research efforts. In Aim 1 we will build on our recent observation that Tg(APP23) can propagate different A strains. We propose to identify A strain diversity from both natural and synthetic sources, both by bioassay and in cell culture. We also plan to generate new transgenic rat models. In Aim 2 we attempt to create a better models of sporadic and genetic human prion diseases by a combination of cell culture and transgenic mouse studies, based on studies demonstrating that bank vole PrP can faithfully propagate human prion strains. In Aim 3, we will investigate a cell model of intracellular tau aggregation to develop a cellular bioassay for tau prions using confocal fluorescence microscopy."

"9473776","Project Summary: Dr. Nicholas Todd is applying for an NIH Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to achieve three interrelated goals: 1) undergo training to gain expertise in two key areas of neuroscience; 2) develop a novel approach to non-invasive neuromodulation based on targeted delivery of neurotransmitter chemicals to the brain; 3) build a strong foundation from which to launch a career as an independent research scientist. The grant proposal has been tailored to achieve these goals by aligning the mentorship expertise, training program, and research aims. Dr. Todd is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) physicist by training with particular experience in MR- guided focused ultrasound (FUS) applications and MR neuroimaging. His ambition is to have a long research career as an independent scientist using the tools of FUS and MRI to further our understanding of brain function and advance treatments for neurological diseases. In order to round out his skill set for such a career, he is now seeking training in two key areas of systems level neuroscience, the neurobiology of brain networks and modern computational methods for analyzing neuroimaging data, and also expertise in the specific area of FUS-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening. Under exceptional mentorship, Dr. Todd will gain a comprehensive understanding of the neurobiology of the pain network (primary mentor, Dr. David Borsook), become proficient in applying Dynamic Causal Modeling for analysis of neuroimaging data (mentor Dr. Lino Becerra and collaborator Dr. Karl Friston), and become an expert in FUS-mediated BBB opening (mentor Dr. Nathan McDannold). The research aims in the proposal build on Dr. Todd?s experience with MR neuroimaging and FUS applications, while providing him with direct experiences in the areas of training. The research work will develop and validate methodology for a novel approach to non-invasive neuromodulation that uses FUS- mediated BBB opening to deliver neurotransmitters to targeted brain regions. The targeted neurotransmitter delivery method will be used to investigate modulation of the rodent pain network. Excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmitters will be delivered to nodes of the pain network (thalamus and somatosensory cortex) in healthy and neuropathic pain rats. The effects will be measured throughout the entire pain network using the three complimentary approaches of functional MRI (fMRI), Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM), and behavioral testing. This work will advance Dr. Todd along his path towards becoming an independent scientist. The training component will provide Dr. Todd with the necessary knowledge of systems level neuroscience to pursue a career using MRI and FUS for brain related research; the research component will develop a new method for non-invasive neuromodulation that will form the basis of future work and grant applications."
"9462784","Project 1: SCD Abstract: Epidemiologic evidence suggests that subjective memory complaints in aging confer some degree of risk for subsequent cognitive decline and/or progression to dementia. There is also accumulating evidence that Alzheimer Disease (AD)-biomarkers, including amyloid-beta (A) pathology, are associated with subjective cognitive complaints in otherwise healthy older individuals a clinical state described as Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD). In the AD research community, growing interest in SCD as potentially the earliest detectable symptoms of AD is further fueled by the goal of increasingly earlier identification of risk in intervention and secondary prevention trials. However, a boundary shift of preclinical AD closer toward normal cognitive aging poses many challenges. Subjective memory complaints and concerns are common, perhaps even normative, among older adults. To date, we lack informative data addressing how to best to distinguish among etiologies of subjective cognitive complaints, including normal cognitive aging. Individual differences in personality traits and mood symptoms are known to be important correlates of subjective cognitive complaints; how these psychological factors interact and whether they are independent of underlying AD pathophysiology is not yet understood. The goal of the proposed Project is to further knowledge about how SCD and A pathology may be associated. To achieve this, we will recruit and study a sample of 56 older volunteers who have presented in a medical setting with concerns about memory or other cognitive decline, but who also have normal objective test performance. We will test the hypothesis that SCD is associated with a higher proportion of A-positive individuals, as assessed by Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)- PET imaging, compared to age- and education-matched cognitively normal controls without presenting concerns. Further, we hypothesize that A-positive (compared to A-negative) SCD will be associated with 1) questionnaire-measured variables, including the personality trait `emotional instability (i.e.,`neuroticism'), episodic memory complaints and degree of dysfunction in daily life; and 2) other AD-biomarker variables reflective of brain changes, including structural and functional MRI, and subtle deficits on more challenging cognitive tests. To the degree possible, an exploratory aim is to compare rates of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) through Clinical Core follow-up, as a function of baseline A status. This Project will provide the foundation for further longitudinal study, with the longer-term goal of determining which biomarker and psychological features of SCD are predictive of clinical progression to MCI and AD. Findings from this Project will further inform models of the AD-pathophysiological sequence in relation to very early behavioral and symptomatic change."
"9660882","The main objective of this research program is to advance our understanding of an important subset of leukocytes called myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) so that new MDSC-based strategies can be developed to treat cancer. Although MDSCs are present in low numbers in healthy individuals, they increase markedly in patients with cancer or chronic inflammation (comprising up to 10% of leukocytes in the blood or spleen). This increase is resulted from aberrant myelopoiesis driven by inflammatory mediators. MDSCs, but not monocytes or neutrophils, are potent suppressors of immune responses. Depletion of MDSCs leads to markedly enhanced anti-tumor immunity, and may be crucial for the success of cancer immunotherapy. Phenotypically, MDSCs are similar to monocytes and neutrophils, but functionally and biochemically they are distinct from the latter cell subsets. MDSCs are ?polarized? immature myeloid cells, producing selectively inhibitory but not inflammatory mediators of myeloid cells. Despite their significance in cancer and inflammatory diseases, MDSCs remain to be one of the least understood subsets of leukocytes. It is unclear what specifies the polarized differentiation program of MDSCs; it is unknown how the inflammatory property of the myeloid lineage is held in check in MDSCs. This grant application is inspired by our recent discovery that MDSCs may utilize a unique polarization signaling complex to control its development and function. The complex consists of a phosphoinositide lipid second messenger and its professional transfer protein TIPE2 (tumor necrosis factor-a-induced protein 8-like 2 or TNFAIP8L2). TIPE2 contains a large hydrophobic cavity constitutively occupied by the phosphoinositide second messenger. Importantly, TIPE2-deficient tumor-bearing mice have a significant defect in the generation and/or function of Gr1+CD11b+ MDSCs. As a consequence, tumor growth in these mice is significantly diminished. In this proposal, we will test the hypotheses that (i) the TIPE2 polarization complex directs both the development and function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and (ii) the dual functionality of TIPE2 specifies the polarization signaling program of myeloid-derived suppressor cells."
"9468251","`Spontaneously' emerging patterned neuronal activity during early development prior to the onset of sensory experience is a widely observed phenomenon in vertebrate nervous systems. Since the first discovery of the waveform of spontaneous activity in the developing rodent retina over 20 years ago, multiple instances of this activity have been demonstrated to play an important role for the refinement of neuronal architecture. However, despite a history of research, our understanding of specific mechanisms such as how this activity appears, propagates, or shapes development is far from complete, mainly due to the technical challenges of manipulating the phenomenon in intact animals. Examining similar processes in a model system with improved genetic tools, such as in Drosophila would provide greater experimental access for understanding this process. However, it remains unclear whether such robust spontaneous neuronal activity that shapes neurodevelopment in vertebrates exists in simpler invertebrate model systems. In preliminary calcium imaging experiments in Drosophila, I observed the existence of robust patterned spontaneous calcium activity in photoreceptor neurons during early retinal development before sensory processing begins. This activity is reminiscent of mammalian retinal waves, thus I propose three aims designed to determine the role and underlying molecular mechanisms of this activity in the developing Drosophila visual system. In aim 1, I will combine genetically encoded calcium and voltage indicators with cell-type specific Gal4 driver lines to fully characterize the cell types engaged in this activity throughout the developing visual system. In aim 2, I will determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms that generate this spontaneous activity using two approaches. First, I will establish whether widely used genetic tools for manipulating neuronal activity in adult animals, such as inward rectifying potassium channels (Kir2.1), can influence spontaneous activity during development. Second, I will conduct a candidate RNAi screen for genes that are required for generating patterned spontaneous calcium activity. Finally, in aim 3, as instructed by mammalian studies, I hypothesize that patterned spontaneous activity plays a functional role in refining neuronal wiring of photoreceptor neurons and will determine which specific developmental processes are regulated by this activity using the mechanistic understanding gained from aim 2. This work aims to establish an invertebrate model of patterned activity-dependent neurodevelopment. This will greatly facilitate mechanistic and detailed in vivo studies of this poorly understood developmental phenomenon and make use of the powerful genetics and genome-wide screening capability available in Drosophila. Ultimately, this will promote an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of activity-dependent neural plasticity, which has critical roles in a variety of neurodevelopmental diseases, including autism spectrum disorder."
"9414914","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to investigate the mechanism by which myeloma cells alter the balance of adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis, thereby suppressing bone formation. Multiple myeloma is characterized by a clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells. Bone destruction is a hallmark of this disease, and has a severe impact on patients' quality of life and survival. Unfortunately, current treatment only offers moderate palliative effects, and bone disease associated with myeloma remains incurable. The bone changes in myeloma patients results from increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and decreased osteoblast-mediated bone formation. In particular, new bone formation that usually occurs at sites of previously resorbed bones is deeply suppressed; as a result areas of bone destruction rarely heal. Previous studies have shown that myeloma cells inhibit osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by myeloma cells produce dickkopf-1, which can suppress Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. However, the role of dickkopf-1 in suppressed bone formation remains controversial, because myeloma cells alone do not produce sufficient dickkopf-1 to suppress osteoblast differentiation, and administration of anti-dickkopf-1 antibody in patients failed to completely restore new bone formation, indicating there must be an additional mechanism for inhibition of osteoblast differentiation seen in myeloma. We observed that myeloma patients and myeloma-bearing mice had not only decreased osteoblastic deposits but also increased adipocytic deposits in bone marrow. In vitro co-culture of MSCs with myeloma cells not only inhibited osteoblast but also enhanced adipocyte differentiation. We further identified that integrin alpha-6 in myeloma cells is a novel factor to regulate adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation. Alpha-6 can bind with alpha-1 to form the integrin very late antigen-6, a cell surface heterodimer highly expressed in myeloma cells. We observed that p38 MAPK, a signaling pathway that is shown to inhibit osteoblastogenesis, upregulated alpha-6 expression. Blocking alpha-6 by an antibody significantly reduced adipocyte but enhanced osteoblast differentiation. We therefore hypothesize that myeloma cell alpha-6 enhances adipocyte differentiation, as a result less MSC differentiation into osteoblasts and less new bone formation. We propose to determine the role and mechanism of alpha-6 in adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis, and develop the novel strategies to enhance bone formation by targeting alpha-6 and the related signaling molecules. The knowledge gained with the successful completion of the proposed work will provide a rationale for a therapeutic to enhance bone formation, filling in the defects caused by myeloma-induced osteoclast-mediated resorption. Of equal importance, as the increased adipocytic deposit is also found in bone marrow of patients with bone-metastatic breast cancer and non-malignant diabetes mellitus and obesity, the proposed work may have direct relevance to reduced bone formation observed in these diseases, and targeting alpha-6 may prove to be a novel approach in treating these patients also."
"9551511","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Exaggerated scarring, or fibrosis, complicates a spectrum of diseases, occurs in all organs, and can be relentless, debilitating, and deadly. It is particularly prevalent in older patients and thoe who have experienced military exposures, posing a serious problem for veterans. Exaggerated innate and adaptive immune responses drive fibrosis, yet the exact mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Recent findings suggest a role for interleukin (IL)-33 in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. IL-33 exists in two forms and has a dual activity. Intranuclear IL-33 (INIL33) is bound to chromatin and appears to regulate gene expression. By contrast, extracellular IL-33 (EXIL33) acts by binding to the cell-surface receptor T1/ST2 and facilitating Th2 responses. The activities of EXIL33 are under active investigation, whereas the activities of INIL33 have been underappreciated and not studied in detail or in association with disease. Our data suggest that fibrosis is driven primarily (yet not exclusively) by INIL33. The levels of INIL3 are elevated in tissues of patients with fibrosis as well as in the mouse model of bleomycin injury, in which the INIL33 form predominates over EXIL. Gene delivery of INIL33 in cell culture and in the animal model leads to collagen accumulation, increased production of profibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, as well as Smad3 activation, all of which are known to contribute to fibrosis. When combined with bleomycin injury, INIL33 potentiates collagen accumulation and the expression of profibrotic cytokines. There is minimal, if any, conversion of INIL33 to EXIL33, no signs of Th2 activation, and gene deficiency of T1/ST2 has minimal, if any, attenuating effect on INIL33-driven fibrosis. We hypothesize that INIL33 is a T1/ST2-independent, Th2-independent, upstream activator of multiple profibrotic mechanisms and that elevated expression of INIL33 in fibroblasts contributes to collagen deposition by these cells through direct and indirect mechanisms. The following Specific Aims will be addressed: 1. Functionally map the IL-33 molecule to identify regions in this protein that confer nuclear localization, chromatin binding, and transcriptional regulation in cultured primary human fibroblasts and in mice in vivo. 2. Define the relative roles of direct mechanisms (binding to the collagen promoter and upregulating collagen gene transcription) and indirect mechanisms (both T1/ST2-dependent and -independent regulation of profibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases) of profibrotic regulation of fibroblasts by IL-33 in cell culture. 3. Delineate the pathophysiological roles of fibroblast-specific expression of IL-33 and of the T1/ST2 cell-surface receptor in vivo by determining the effects of fibroblast-specific IL-33 deficiency, ubiquitous IL-33 deficiency, and ubiquitous T1/ST2 deficiency on inflammation and fibrosis in the bleomycin injury model. Successful completion of these studies will clarify the role and mechanisms of fibroblast activation by INIL-33, laying the groundwork for future development of rational IL-33-targeting antifibrotic strategies."
"9462780","Core D: Neuropathology Care Abstract  The Neuropathology (NP) Core fulfills several important roles within the University of Pittsburgh ADRC (PITT-ADRC). Postmortem neuropathological confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders and the assessment of co-existing neurodegenerative and vascular disease processes is essential to promote progress in diagnosis, treatment and prevention of AD. Since its inception, the NP Core has collected and characterized >600 brains from PITT-ADRC subjects at various disease stages. This resource has been extensively utilized for teaching purposes and for research studies by local and national investigators to develop amyloid imaging agents and correlate in vivo amyloid imaging results with postmortem findings, improve our understanding of genetic factors contributing to AD risk and advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiology of psychiatric comorbidities and neuroinflammatory processes.  Our proposed approach to fulfill the diagnostic, tissue banking, research and educational roles of the NP Core is outlined in five specific aims: 1) The NP Core will continue to maintain and expand a well-catalogued bank of frozen and formalin-fixed tissue samples of ADRC subjects. A special emphasis will be placed on harvesting brains from cognitively normal and mildly impaired subjects, which represent a main recruitment focus of our Clinical Core. 2) All banked cases will undergo detailed diagnostic evaluation using the latest consensus criteria. Results will be shared with ADRC clinical staff, families and uploaded to centralized databases (NACC). 3) The NP core will increasingly take advantage of new digital microscopy technologies by utilizing whole slide scanning systems and virtual slides for didactic purposes, and, in combination with digital image analysis tools, for quantitative assessments of tau and amyloid burdens. 4) The NP Core will continue to participate in local and national research efforts by providing brain bank tissue materials, data from diagnostic evaluations and technical expertise. The NP core will closely collaborate with other PITT-ADRC cores and projects in joint research studies and will engage in NP Core-driven research projects. Most of these studies will focus on one of the central themes of our ADRC correlating postmortem neuropathology data with pre- mortem and post-mortem imaging data, genotype information, presence of psychosis, and neuroinflammation. 5) Brain bank cases will be utilized to educate neuropathology fellows, residents, medical students and investigators about the neuropathologic features of neurodegenerative diseases.  The PITT-ADRC NP Core is committed to participate in multi-institutional collaborative research studies by providing neuropathology data and tissue resources, to continue its efforts to improve our understanding of neuropathologic correlates of psychosis in AD and PET imaging findings and to expand our knowledge of neuroinflammatory and neuropathologic phenotypes of AD risk genes."

"9468247","The pathogenesis of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) remains unclear, though there is growing support for a synergistic relationship between vascular dysfunction and accumulation of amyloid-? and neurofibrillary tangles. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are prevalent in the VA population, have been linked to cognitive decline and higher risk for dementia, and may represent potential targets for remediating age-related cognitive decline. [CVD risk factors are associated with peripheral vascular (e.g., increased pulse wave velocity [PWV] indicating arterial stiffness) and cerebrovascular changes (e.g., reduced cerebral blood flow [CBF]; decreased cerebrovascular reactivity [CVR] indicating reduced ability of the cerebral vasculature to adjust CBF).] Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is tightly coupled with metabolism underlying cognition by increasing local delivery of oxygen and glucose to support neural function, and as such is an indirect measure of neural activity and vascular function. [Animal models suggest reduced CBF (aka, hypoperfusion) contributes to AD-like neurodegeneration by increasing amyloid-? accumulation and tau phosphorylation--the hallmark neuropathology of AD. Translating these findings to humans is critical to identify and refine biomarkers of AD and ultimately improve early detection and treatment.] We have shown altered CBF in prefrontal and medial temporal lobe regions in older adults at genetic (APOE ?4 carriers) or cognitive (mild cognitive impairment; MCI) risk for AD that is associated with memory and executive function, implicating CBF as a potential biomarker of AD. This application aims to elucidate the link between the vascular and neurodegenerative pathophysiological process of AD and the emergence of clinical symptoms to lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of cognitive decline. Thus, the current application: [1) examines the association between neurovascular (CBF) and cerebrovascular (CVR) function and cognition in at-risk older Veterans and tests potential AD-related mechanisms (e.g., cerebral spinal fluid [CSF] AD biomarkers) that mediate this relationship, 2) examines whether cerebrovascular function moderates the relationship between CBF and CSF biomarkers, and 3) examines moderating effects of individual risk factors (e.g., increased arterial stiffness, elevated sedentary time, APOE ?4).] This study will examine cognitive, vascular, and brain function in 120 English-speaking non-demented Veterans aged 65+ with at least 2 CVD risk factors, placing them at increased risk for cognitive decline. Assessments include well-validated and standardized cognitive testing (e.g., NIH Toolbox), state-of-the-art MR imaging (to measure CBF and CVR), comprehensive vascular function assessment (including carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, blood pressure, carotid ultrasound), lumbar puncture to assay CSF AD biomarkers (including A?42, p-tau181, and total tau), accelerometry to assess physical activity/sedentary level, and APOE genotyping. [This novel proposal aims to test the central hypothesis that CBF and/or CVR support cognitive performance and this relationship is mediated by the presence of CSF biomarkers of AD neurodegeneration, suggesting a synergistic contribution of neurovascular and cerebrovascular dysfunction to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in older at-risk Veterans.] The completion of the proposed aims will achieve the following goals that could guide future research in early dementia detection and prevention: 1) refine the prevailing biomarker model of AD by more firmly establishing the independent or combined contribution of neuropathological and cerebrovascular AD risk factors in the cascade of events precipitating AD, 2) establish prognostic utility of imaging, neuropsychological, neuropathological, and vascular biomarkers to detect cognitive decline, and 3) improve mechanistic understanding of AD risk and identify potential therapeutic targets that will ultimately inform interventions to prevent or delay the onset of AD."
"9458699","Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to improve clinical trial design for early diffuse systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients by using a clinical observational cohort to address three crucial gaps in knowledge. These three critical knowledge gaps include 1) how disease duration should be optimally defined as an inclusion criterion for trials using skin change as a primary outcome, 2) if trial design or analysis should be stratified by SSc-associated autoantibody, and 3) the effect size of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on skin thickness score in early diffuse SSc. Specific Aim 1 will determine the most appropriate definition of disease onset, first non-Raynaud symptom compared to the first SSc-attributable symptom, by which to define disease duration as a clinical trial inclusion criterion. Specific Aim 2 will then establish if clinical trials may be improved through stratification of trial participants by SSc-associated autoantibody (anti-Scl70 or anti-RNA polymerase 3). For Specific Aims 1 and 2, the already existing, prospectively collected clinical observational cohort of the University of Pittsburgh Scleroderma Center will be used for analysis. In Specific Aim 3 an observational cohort of early diffuse SSc patients treated with MMF will be created and made available for future trial use with information on disease characteristics, medication use and skin scores over a one year period. To accomplish this, the pre-existing and prospectively followed cohort of early diffuse SSc patients treated with MMF in the Pittsburgh database will be combined with a newly recruited additional cohort of early diffuse SSc patients treated with MMF to form an observational hybrid cohort. The newly-recruited patients will enrich the follow-up skin score data taken at 3-month time intervals and add samples for skin gene expression. We will perform a matched analysis of the MMF-treated hybrid cohort to our historical non-MMF treated early diffuse SSc patients and assess the effect size of MMF on skin at 6 and 12 months of therapy. Potential applications of a MMF-treated cohort are as a comparator or control group for future open label studies of potential therapeutics for early diffuse SSc or to assess the effect of new investigational drugs in early phase trials when MMF is allowed as ongoing background therapy. The knowledge gained from each of the proposal Aims can be applied to both ongoing early diffuse SSc clinical trials and trials in the planning stage."
"9683840","ABSTRACT Converging evidence documents moderate to high rates of sexual violence against youth. The 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a national survey of students in grades 9-12, found a lifetime reported prevalence for unwanted physically forced sexual intercourse of 11.8% for girls and 4.5% for boys (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). In addition, physical or verbal sexual harassment is extremely common in schools among adolescents, with one national study reporting that 57% of boys and 50% of girls reported sexually harassing a peer. Despite the importance of this public health problem, sexual violence prevention has a limited evidence base. Equally challenging, most school-based anti-violence programs have focused on individual types of aggression, typically physical aggression occurring within relationships (Leff, Power, Manz, Costigan, & Nabors, 2001). At present few programs systematically address broader social-ecological factors such as school-wide norms and youth-adult connectedness that research identifies as major drivers of SV (Basile, Espelage, Rivers, McMahon, & Simon, 2009). To address this gap, this application proposes a large- scale RCT evaluation of Sources of Strength to evaluate for sexual violence perpetration outcomes. Sources of Strength is an evidence based program for youth suicide that trains student key leaders to strengthen social connectedness and healthy norms school-wide (Wyman et al., 2010) and is listed on the National Registry of Evidence Based Programs and Practices (NREPP). This project will expand the existing evidence base by evaluating Sources of Strength for sexual violence outcomes, which has never been done before. Twenty-four high schools will be recruited and stratified (rural or urban) and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a) immediate Sources of Strength intervention, (b) wait-list for Sources of Strength Implementation after 16 months. A representative sample of each school (grades 9-11, in total n = 7200) will be enrolled for repeated longitudinal assessment to assess SoS impact as well as moderators and mediators of its efficacy. The intervention will be rolled out between spring 2017 and spring 2020 with cohorts receiving the intervention for 16 months and completing a total of four assessments. This study is highly innovative and could have substantial public health impact by targeting shared risk and protective factors to demonstrate impact on multiple forms of violence. This approach builds on the call to evaluate `cross over' effective of preventive interventions (Reider & Sims, 2016) in order to identify common prevention pathways to multiple health behavior problems. A strength of our proposed study is measurement of factors across student (behaviors, attitudes, norms), interpersonal (peer social networks), and school-level (school climate based on aggregate school staff reports).

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective phenotype in those BMPR2 mutation carriers without FPAH could lead to novel therapeutic approaches for familial and non-familial forms of PAH as they all share reduced expression or function of BMPR2. These studies also hold the key to understanding penetrance in other genetic conditions related to PAH, such as the caveolin 1 (CAV1) mutation. Studies carried out during Dr. Gu's AHA postdoctoral fellowship utilized iPSC-ECs from three sets of FPAH patients and from their family members with the same BMPR2 mutation but without disease. Dr. Gu uncovered a compensatory p-p38 signaling pathway leading to preserved adhesion and survival of iPSC-ECs from the unaffected mutation carriers. The mechanism accounting for the preserved p-p38 signaling appears to differ among the families. The first aim (K99 phase) of Dr. Gu's proposed studies is to extend the findings described above, through gain and loss of function studies to pursue the mechanism of `carrier compensation'. She will also determine whether correction of the BMPR2 mutation by CRISPR/Cas9 technology restores BMP signaling pathways and EC functions in FPAH iPSC-EC from all three families. The second aim (K99 phase) will determine how the transcriptome and epigenome explain the protective phenotype in the unaffected mutation carriers. RNA-Seq was carried out on iPSC-ECs from all family members (n=11). Seventy-one differentially expressed genes were identified by comparing iPSC-ECs from controls and mutation carriers versus FPAH patients, and four genes of interest have been verified by qPCR. This aim is strengthened by a collaboration with Dr. Michael Snyder's lab, to help relate gene expression changes with alterations in histone marks identified by ChIP-Seq and polymorphisms called by whole genome sequencing. The third aim (R00 phase) will extend studies in Specific Aims 1 and 2 to novel mutations associated with FPAH, such as caveolin1. In the fourth aim (R00 phase), Dr. Gu will establish a high-throughput platform for personalized drug screening using iPSC-ECs as a continuous cell source. These studies will help Dr. Gu to launch a research program that optimizes the use of iPSC-derived vascular cells and integrative `omic' technologies to model vascular disease pathophysiology and to develop personalized treatments using either a bioinformatics' approach or high throughput screening to repurpose FDA approved drugs that activate the protective pathway."
"9465410","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Rationale: Approximately 15-20% of adults have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and evidence indicates that the prevalence of OSA is perhaps twice as high among veterans. OSA has been clearly linked to increased mortality and multiple morbidities, and undoubtedly contributes to the high prevalence of health problems among veterans. Current treatments for OSA are not well tolerated, often have limited efficacy, and often do not result in improvements in health. Our recent research demonstrated that 12 weeks of moderate exercise training elicited a reduction of OSA of ~25%, as well as significant improvement in mood, fatigue, quality of life, and cardiovascular health. Interestingly, as with other health benefits of exercise, our research is consistent with other research showing that exercise can reduce OSA independent of changes in body weight. These studies raise the exciting possibility that exercise training combined with modest weight loss could elicit a chronic reduction in OSA of 50% or more. Objectives: Our Objective is to compare the effects of 16 weeks of exercise training alone, weight loss alone, and exercise + weight loss on OSA severity and associated morbidity. Methods: Following extensive screening and baseline assessment, N=90 overweight/obese veterans (ages 18-60 years) with mild to severe OSA will be randomized to one of three 16- week treatments. (1) Exercise Alone (n=30) will involve training 4 days per week under supervision of a clinical exercise physiologist. It will include aerobic exercise (treadmill, cycling, elliptical) that will gradually increase to 30-45 min on 4 days/wk, as well as resistance exercise (15 min) on 2 days/week. (2) Weight Loss Alone (n=30) will involve a structured meal plan (including some meal replacement with shakes or bars), and weekly counseling designed to elicit a reduction in body weight of 10%. (3) Exercise + Weight Loss (n=30) will involve the same exercise and weight loss interventions as in the other treatments. Outside of the interventions, participants will be asked to maintain their usual exercise and diet habits, as verified, respectively, with actigraphic recording and a 24-hr food recall. Before and after the treatments, participants will undergo 5 days/nights of home-based actigraphic and diary- assessed sleep, and one night of laboratory polysomnographic recording of sleep, including OSA severity. Comorbidity measures will include pre- to post-treatment changes in blood pressure, heart rate variability, glucose, insulin, lipids, hemoglobin a1c, body weight/composition, and inflammation (e.g., CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha). Also measured will be monthly changes in self-reports of sleep quality, functional outcomes of sleepiness (FOSQ), and snoring symptoms. A 3-month follow-up will include home assessment of OSA, as well as sleep quality, FOSQ, and snoring. Mediation analysis will explore whether improvements in OSA are mediated by changes in percent of deep sleep, body weight, trunk body fat percent, trunk total mass, respiratory muscle strength, and upper airway obstruction assessed in the laboratory. Implications for Future Research. Demonstration of a reduction of OSA by e 50% would result in extensive subsequent studies. These would likely include studies of dose-response effects; comparisons of different modes of exercise; studies of the feasibility of telemedicine approaches to the interventions; comparative efficacy studies vs. PAP; further mechanistic studies, for example, of upper airway collapsibility and composition (e.g, via MRI); and studies of other positive health outcomes, such as extensive heart imaging."
"9564761","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Difficulties with memory are among the most common complaints in the veteran population. The proposed work involves three related studies of the organization and neurology of human memory systems. The declarative memory system supports the capacity to learn and remember facts and events and depends on the hippocampus. Historically, declarative memory has been thought to represent conscious memory, i.e., knowledge that is accessible to awareness. Indeed, accessibility to awareness has been thought to be a defining feature of declarative memory. However, the characteristics of declarative (and nondeclarative) memory remain active topics of research, and the link between declarative memory, hippocampal function, and conscious knowledge is uncertain. One recent proposal is that memory can be hippocampus-dependent but can at the same time be inaccessible to conscious awareness. These issues became especially prominent following the discovery that eye movements can reflect a form of memory. For example, individuals scan a scene differently depending on whether the scene is novel or familiar. They make fewer fixations, sample fewer regions, and also (from our Preliminary Studies) sample different regions when viewing a familiar (rather than a novel) scene.  What kind of memory effects are these? Do these eye movement effects simply provide another measure of conscious, declarative memory? Alternatively, are they automatic and independent of awareness that a scene is novel or familiar? Furthermore, are they hippocampus-dependent or hippocampus-independent? The nature of eye movements has potential clinical relevance for veterans with limited response capability. These questions will be addressed in three experiments. The first experiment (1a) aims to determine whether experience-dependent eye movements vary with the strength of declarative memory (four levels of strength will be established by varying the number of scenes to be remembered and the retention interval across four groups of participants). Experiment 1b will test well-characterized memory-impaired patients with bilateral hippocampal lesions to ask whether these experience-dependent eye movements are hippocampus-dependent.  The second experiment (2a) introduces a novel experimental design to ask, scene by scene, whether experience-dependent eye movements occur only when individuals consciously (explicitly) recognize a scene as familiar, or whether these eye movements are automatic and occur independently of the conscious experience of recognition. Experiment 2b will test memory-impaired patients to ask, under different conditions than Experiment 1b, whether experience dependent eye movements are hippocampus-dependent.  The third experiment turns to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using an improved eye movement tracker compatible with the fMRI environment. Hippocampal activity increases when familiar scenes are presented and is even greater when scenes are recognized with high confidence. Here the question is whether hippocampal activity, recorded in response to familiar scenes, correlates with the eye movement effects. Is there a tight relationship between these two measures, or do eye movements to familiar vs. novel scenes occur independently of hippocampal activity. Through these three experiments, it should be possible to decide what kind of memory is expressed through eye movements, whether it is conscious or unconscious memory, and whether it is hippocampus-dependent or independent. These questions are foundational to understanding the memory systems of the human brain."
"9462144","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental imagery is a salient part of mental awareness but very little is understood about how visual percepts are generated without retinal input, or how visual features that are known to be an important part of visual representation drive neural activity during mental imagery. Our long-term goal is to provide clinicians with the ability to objectively interpret mental images by accessing underlying neural activity. The objective of the current work is to develop a basic understanding of the similarities and differences between the representation of visual features in veridical and mental images. Our central hypothesis is that the mechanisms for representing visual features during perception are fundamentally conserved during mental imagery and that receptive fields that link activity to veridical images should predict activity evoked by mental imagery. Nonetheless, mental images are clearly distinguishable from veridical images and we consider three potential sources of difference: (1) The potential for exaggerated effects of attention on mental imagery; (2) The predominate influence of feedback connections from high-level visual areas with large receptive fields (relative to the retina) during mental imagery; (3) Differences between the neural processes of generating mental images and the physical processes that generate retinal images. Two Specific Aims are proposed that will be pursued using an innovative new approach for analyzing functional MRI signals that is based upon voxel-wise modeling of receptive fields. Under this approach, a separate predictive model is constructed for each and every voxel in the acquired volumes. The model links activity measured in a voxel directly to specific visual features, including spatial frequency, orientation, object category, and object location. The models can then be used to decode perceived or recalled scenes from measured brain activity. We expect that our contribution will be an advance in our understanding of the specific factors that determine the degree of consistency between activity during imagery and perception, as well as a significant advance in our ability to quantitatively model the high-level visual areas where activity is most consistent. This contribution will be significant because it will take us several necessary steps toward the development of imagery receptive fields-predictive receptive field models that explain how the visual features in a scene drive activity when the scene is recalled in the form of a mental image. A receptive field model for mental imagery would place within reach a decoding algorithm for objectively interpreting and even pictorially reconstructing mental images."
"9537572","ABSTRACT (Project 1: Sez, Betterton, Sorooshian)  In semiarid environments such as the Southwestern US, mining sites are an important source of airborne metal(loid) contaminants. High-temperature smelting produces vapors that condense to form sub- micron particles which may be transported by wind, while contaminated tailings deposits are susceptible to wind erosion. Dust and aerosol particles mobilize trace metal(loids), which then can accumulate in soils, natural waters, and vegetation, leading to human exposure through inhalation and incidental dust ingestion. In particular, acute and chronic exposures to arsenic and lead, two toxic elements present in many mining sites in arid and semiarid regions around the world, pose significant health risks, including cancer and non-malignant lung diseases. This project is directed towards a comprehensive understanding of the physical and chemical properties of dust and aerosol generated from mining sites, emphasizing their role in the transport of arsenic and lead to the local environment and the associated human health risks. We hypothesize that metal(loid) contaminant transport by atmospheric dust and aerosol from mining sites can be quantified by computational fluid dynamics models based on meteorological conditions and particle size distribution of particle emissions. We will develop these models based on data collected from two Superfund sites in Arizona focusing on the role of aerosol and dust particle size distribution on the fate and transport of contaminants. This is important because smelting in particular appears to concentrate lead and arsenic in sub-micron particles, which are more susceptible to inhalation into the lungs than larger particles. Particle size distribution also plays a role in the transport of particles through the outdoor/indoor barrier, and this will be examined at two Superfund mining sites. Simulations will be complemented by indoor sampling, which will help to establish the risks of indoor exposure to lead and arsenic. The flux and particle size range of dust emissions from contaminated sites will be characterized using a laboratory-scale dust generator and a portable wind tunnel. We will then incorporate source apportionment into the modeling effort to ensure that natural sources of contamination are distinguished from mining sources. The modeling effort will be extended to the assessment of remediation of mine tailings by phytostabilization. Preliminary data gathered at a Superfund site has shown that vegetated plots tend to attenuate dust generation from the tailings by intercepting dust transported by winds and by reducing dust and aerosol emissions. This framework can be generalized to other mining-related sites in Arizona, across the Southwest, and even across the US, to improve our understanding of dust- and aerosol-associated exposure of populations to arsenic, lead and other contaminants, and will be used in UA SRP Biomedical Projects to better understand the effects of this understudied exposure route."

"9431047","This pilot GWI research project seeks to extend and validate our early findings of a potential role for telomere biology/telomerase disruption in GWI pathogenesis.  We have previously developed and extensively characterized a mouse model of exposure to the Gulf War agents Pyridostigmine Bromide (PB) and Permethrin (PER) wherein the mice receive acute (10 days) exposure and have then been evaluated at a range of timepoints extending to 22 months post exposure (approximately 2 years of age). We consider that this model is relevant to the relatively acute exposure suffered by our troops in 1990/1991, and the development and persistence of symptomatology 25 years later. We observe neurobehavioral deficits and pathogenic biochemical and neuropathological changes in the brains and blood of these mice.  Aging is a biological process that affects most cells, organisms and species, increasing susceptibility to many diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Telomere biology is now known to be a critical component of the aging and disease process, presenting telomere maintenance (through action of the telomerase enzyme) as a therapeutic target. Individuals with GWI suffer from a diverse array of chronic conditions, and we have hypothesized that their deployment related exposures may have caused a fundamental disruption of telomere biology homeostasis. Our pilot data from cell culture and our animal models suggest that there is disruption of telomerase activity following exposure to the GW agents PB and PER.  Thus, the goal of this project is to further explore this phenomenon in blood samples from previously collected GW-agent-exposed and unexposed mouse cohorts, and to then evaluate the effects of treatment with telomerase maintaining/boosting compounds in new cohorts of GWI mice and controls. We appreciate that a possible role for telomere biology in GWI presents many areas for further investigation, including mechanism of action for how GW agents caused such disruption. However, given that our current GWI patient population suffered their toxic exposures 25 years ago, in this pilot project we wish to first validate telomere/telomerase disruption in our model, and then determine if this line of research holds any promise as a therapeutic strategy for veterans with GWI. If our hypothesis is upheld, then a future full scale Merit submission will explore the relationship between GW agent exposure and telomere biology in much greater detail, to hone therapeutic approaches."
"9617366","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goals of the Cancer Cell Biology Program are: (i) to understand, at the molecular and cellular levels, mechanisms underlying tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and resistance to therapeutic treatment, and (ii) to identify and validate new targets for cancer therapy. Insight derived from these studies, when integrated with research and development from other programs, will provide targets and guidance for the development of strategies for therapeutic intervention of cancer. Toward these two goals, the Program faculty investigates various aspects of cancer cell biology, including growth factors and receptors; angiogenesis and vascular biology; apoptosis; cell cycle regulation; chromatin biochemistry and transcriptional regulation; cell microstructure and function; DNA replication and repair; metabolism; regulatory RNA; and signal transduction. Led by two co-leaders with complementary expertise, Yue Xiong and James Bear, the program organizes these different areas into four major research themes: (1) Cell Cycle, (2) Cell Signaling, (3) Cell Movement and Organization, and (4) Epigenetics and Chromatin Biology. The major emphasis of the Program is to foster integrated research that spans these inter-related themes, enhancing the research and translational capabilities of program investigators through the establishment, expansion and utilization of appropriate core facilities, and promoting interactions with investigators from other LCCC basic, clinical and population sciences programs.         The Cancer Cell Biology Program consists of 45 members who are associated with 7 basic science and 4 clinical departments at UNC-Chapel Hill. During the last funding period, program members have published 644 cancer-related articles (30% collaborative). In 2014, our program members held 101 grants and $27.3M (total cost) in annual extramural funding, including 24 grants and $5.8M (total costs) from the NCI."
"9515511","SUMMARY The goal of this renewal application is to define mechanisms that drive the assembly and organization of enterocyte microvilli: actin bundle-supported membrane protrusions that extend from the apical surface into the gut lumen and play essential roles in nutrient absorption and barrier function. Numerous intestinal diseases are linked to the destruction or malformation of microvilli, underscoring the critical physiological importance of these protrusions. The surface of a single mature enterocyte is populated by hundreds of microvilli, which form a tightly packed array known as the ?brush border?. Tight packing maximizes the number of microvilli, the apical holding capacity for membrane-associated nutrient processing and host defense factors, and thus the functional capacity of the cell. Although mechanisms of brush border assembly remain poorly understood, our laboratory has begun to make significant progress on this problem. Groundbreaking studies performed during the initial funding period led to the discovery of a fundamental mechanism that enterocytes use to organize and optimize the packing density of microvilli. Briefly, we discovered two brush border-specific protocadherins, CDHR2 and CDHR5, which form adhesion complexes that physically link the tips of adjacent microvilli on mature villus enterocytes. In cultured cells lacking these factors, brush border assembly is impaired such that microvilli are disheveled with significantly reduced packing density. We also identified factors that interact with the cytoplasmic tails of both protocadherins, including the scaffolds USH1C and ANKS4B, and the actin-based motor, MYO7B. We refer to the entire five-protein complex as the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC). Our published work suggests that USH1C/ANKS4B/MYO7B form a transport module that delivers CDHR2- dependent adhesion links to the distal tips of microvilli. Preliminary results also show that adhesion links form between microvilli on the surface of immature cells in the crypt, although they do not yet target to microvillar tips, suggesting that IMAC transport is activated later, perhaps during the crypt-villus transition. Finally, newly developed CDHR2 KO mice exhibit striking defects in brush border morphology that have consequences for enterocyte differentiation and function. In light of these findings, we propose our central hypothesis: USH1C induces clustering of MYO7B motors, which activates transport of CDHR2-dependent adhesion links to microvillar tips and drives functional maturation of the brush border as cells exit the crypt. To test this model, we will use state-of-the-art super-resolution microscopy, new forms of electron microscopy, structural biology, and assays of epithelial function to: (Aim 1) determine how IMAC formation and localization at microvillar tips contribute to BB assembly and enterocyte function in vivo, (Aim 2) dissect mechanisms that regulate MYO7B- driven IMAC transport to microvillar tips, and (Aim 3) define the structural basis of CDHR2-dependent adhesion. Completion of these studies will lead to new insight on mechanisms driving brush border assembly, the basis of diseases characterized by brush border perturbation, and the morphogenesis of transporting epithelial cells."
"9451295","Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying hemodynamic abnormalities in glaucoma and to find a means to mitigate retinal ganglion cell damage.  In this project, we will test a novel hypothesis that astrocytes are central to pressure-initiated ocular BF autoregulation, as they sense transmural pressure and tissue oxygen levels to coordinate the perivascular astrocytic network and feedback to vessels to modulate diameter and thus blood flow and that failure of this mechanism results in hemodynamic imbalance.  The hypothesis will be tested in rat retina and monkey optic nerve head in three specific aims: (1) Pressure-initiated retinal astrocyte activation is independent of neuronal and metabolic activity.  This will be achieved by elimination of retinal ganglion cell and application of systemic hyperoxia. (2) Astrocytes modulate retinal vascular tone and coordinate pressure-initiated autoregulation under  modulation by tissue oxygen status. To test the hypothesis, all or a specific pathway of the proposed  feedback mechanism in the astrocytes will be inhibited and tested under hyperoxia and normoxia to  compare the hemodynamic parameter changes under the conditions. (3) Pharmacological interruption of astrocyte feedback mechanism impairs hemodynamic balance  within the optic nerve head and this is further modified by the alteration of oxygen supply.  The following techniques are used: (1) an ex vivo system that enables precise control of intravascular and extravascular pressures thus allowing simultaneous quantifying astrocytic Ca2+ (Fluo-4AM) and changes in vascular diameter. (2) In vivo imaging of astrocytic Ca2+ (Fluo-4AM, fluorescence) and vessel diameter (infrared) using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope, while blood pressure and intraocular pressure are manipulated in both rats and nonhuman primates. (3) Combining pharmacological inhibitors and adeno-associated virus 8 vector delivery with an astrocyte-specific promotor inhibit either all the bioactivity of astrocytes or the key proteins in the proposed astrocytic feedback and propagation pathways. (4) In vivo assessment of BF autoregulation in retina and optic nerve by dynamic autoregulation analysis using laser speckle imaging techniques.  The proposal is expected to elucidate a novel role for astrocytes in pressure-initiated BF autoregulation, thus significantly expanding our understanding of hemodynamic control in the central nervous system. This basic understanding provides a platform for future studies of novel therapeutic targets in diseases associated with autoregulation dysfunction, including glaucoma."
"9550899","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic viral infection mediates premature T cell aging and vaccine failure through regulation of microRNA-regulated proteins, with an aim to develop effective approaches to improve vaccine efficacy in virus-infected individuals. To this end, we will use a model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine failure i the setting of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The proposal is based on the fact that co-infection of HBV with HCV is common due to shared risk factors, and as such HBV vaccine is required to prevent super-infection and its associated increase in morbidity and mortality; however, vaccine responses in virus-infected individuals are often blunted. This phenomenon is also observed in the elderly who frequently fail to respond to vaccinations; and attempts to improve the rate of immunizations in both infected and aged populations have been unsuccessful, in part due to our poor understanding of the mechanisms that inhibit vaccine responses in these settings. In studying the effect of chronic viral infection on T cell functions, we and others have recently found that chronic HCV infection leads to T cell dysfunction mediated through up-regulation of aging markers, including killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1) and dual specific phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), concomitant with a decline of microRNA-155 (miR155) levels in CD4 T cells. Remarkably, these alterations are associated with impaired CD4 T cell functions in HCV- infected individuals and are more prominent in HBV vaccine non-responders (HBV-NR) compared to age- matched HBV vaccine responders (HBV-R). It has been demonstrated that with increasing age, KLRG1 is up- regulated and leads to inhibition of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling; whereas DUSP6 is increased and leads to recalibration of the TCR activation threshold; and miR155 decline is known to permit translation of a set of target genes related to T cell inhibition. However, the mechanisms underlying miR155/KLRG1/DUSP6 expression and regulation of premature T cell aging and vaccine responses during HCV infection remain unknown. In this proposal, we hypothesize that HCV-induced loss of miR155 mediates premature T cell aging by up-regulating KLRG1 and/or DUSP6 expressions, such that targeting these inhibitory pathways may rescue impaired CD4 T cell functions and subsequently boost blunted vaccine responses in virus-infected individuals. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out the following two specific aims: Aim 1 will define the transcriptional and translational mechanisms that control miR155 expression and the role of miR155 in regulating KLRG1 and/or DUSP6 expression in T cells during HCV infection; Aim 2 will examine the consequences of miR155 loss and KLRG1/DUSP6 over-expression in T cell function and vaccine response in virus-infected individuals. This translational study is significant in that it provides a working model to explore mechanisms that may be fundamental to diminished vaccine responses in general, particularly in the setting of immunocompromise by HIV, hemodialysis, transplantation, and cancer."
"9667657","Project Summary/Abstract Francisella tularensis is the causative agent of tularemia, the pneumonic form of which can be fatal even with appropriate treatment. This project builds on our recent identification (by contact PI Horwitz's group) of the Francisella Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) and on our subsequent determination (by PI Zhou's group) of the first atomic model of its sheath by cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM). T6SSs are large, complex and multi- protein nanomachines that Gram-negative bacteria use to sense environmental cues and deliver toxins into other bacteria or into eukaryotic hosts, as in the case of Francisella, where they mediate phagosome escape and intracytoplasmic replication. They are important virulence determinants, present in 25% of Gram-negative bacteria and in an even higher percentage of those that are human pathogens. However, our lack of knowledge concerning both their composition and structure has limited our understanding of their mechanisms of pathogenesis and our ability to ultimately design countermeasures against a myriad of bacterial diseases. The T6SS of Francisella is both significant and attractive to study because of the high infectivity and lethality of Francisella species and its relative simplicity compared with other T6SSs. However, significant knowledge gaps are yet to be filled including: (1) an atomic model of the structure of the pre-contraction outer sheath; (2) the composition and an atomic model of the baseplate and membrane core complex; and (3) the composition of the Francisella inner tube and secreted effector protein complex and an atomic model of its interaction with the sheath, baseplate, and membrane core complex in the pre-contraction state and during the contraction process. Towards this end, we propose to use the Francisella novicida T6SS as a model to advance our understanding of the T6SS, and verify our findings in the closely related F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS). We shall first obtain the atomic model of the sheath and tube complex in the purified T6SS in its pre- contraction state by single-particle cryoEM with electron-counting technology; then, by structure-guided mutagenesis and comparison with our atomic model of contracted sheath, we shall elucidate the energetics and mechanism of T6SS contraction. Second, by crosslinking, affinity pull-down, immunoblotting, proteomics, and bacterial 2-hybrid analyses, we shall determine the composition and protein interactions of the baseplate and membrane core complex. This information will be used in conjunction with cryoET of T6SS-containing minicells to determine the composition and structure of the T6SS baseplate and membrane core complex in their pre- and post-contraction states. Lastly, we shall determine the composition and structure of the Francisella T6SS effector (VgrG)-containing arrow complex. Elucidation of atomic level interactions among the protein components of the T6SS will guide further studies of its function and the development of new strategies for treating and preventing diseases caused by the numerous important pathogenic bacteria that have a T6SS."
"9489058","Skin cancer is primarily caused by environmental ultraviolet (UV) exposure from sunlight. We have shown that loss of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR?) in the epidermis of mice (Pparg-/-epi mice) promotes UV-induced skin cancer formation. We have also shown that the PPAR? agonist rosiglitazone (Rosig) protects mice against skin cancer formation. The historical method for classifying PPAR? ligands is by their ability to activate genes associated with adipogenesis through a process called transactivation. However, PPAR? ligands that both activate and suppress transactivation have been shown to exhibit anti-tumor activity. This has created confusion regarding the anti-tumor effects of PPAR?. However, some PPAR? ligands also exhibit the ability to suppress the expression of other genes through a distinctly different mechanism called ?transrepression?. We hypothesize that PPAR? ligand-dependent transrepression, rather than transactivation, is key to the anti-tumor activity of PPAR?. UV suppresses T-cell mediated contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses as well as anti-tumor immune responses (termed UV-induced immunosuppression (UV-IS)). UV-IS likely promotes skin cancer formation by promoting tolerance to tumor-specific antigens. We show that loss of epidermal PPAR? produces an immunosuppressive state resulting in a marked defect in CHS responses as well as enhanced skin tumor growth. We also show that Rosig treatment blocks UV-IS and suppresses skin tumor growth in immune competent, but not immunodeficient mouse hosts. We hypothesize that PPAR? activation suppresses UV-induced skin cancer formation at least in part by its ability to transrepress signaling pathways involved in UV-IS. In particular, we show that PPAR? transrepresses a protein called tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF-?) that is present as both a full-length transmembrane form and a soluble proteolytically cleaved form. We propose that the transmembrane form (tmTNF-?) is primarily involved in immune suppression. Thus, PPAR? ligands may prove useful as long-term chemopreventive agents that would promote immune-mediated clearance of nascent skin tumors in individuals at high risk for skin cancer. Finally, recent studies have shown that radiation therapy, like UV, also promotes systemic immunosuppression through its ability to induce oxidative stress. We propose that transrepressive PPAR? ligands will reverse this immune suppression and promote the so-called abscopal effect. This abscopal effect results in anti-tumor responses in tumors that are outside the field of radiation treatment. Although spontaneous abscopal effects occur rarely, evidence exists that efforts to promote immune responses can make this response commonplace. We propose that transrepressive PPAR? ligands will act in concert with radiotherapy to promote the abscopal effect. To examine our hypothesis, the studies will be divided into the following three specific aims (SA):  SA#1: Determine whether epidermal PPAR? regulates CHS responses through transmembrane TNF-?  (tmTNF-?) rather than soluble TNF-? (solTNF-?).  SA#2: Determine the capacity of diverse PPAR? ligands to induce PPAR?-specific transrepression of  UVB-induced NF-?B activation and TNF-? production in vitro and in vivo. We will correlate this  transrepressive activity with the ability to reverse UV-induced suppression of CHS responses.  SA#3: Determine whether transrepressive PPAR? ligands promote anti-tumor immune responses either  alone or following external beam radiation therapy. These studies will demonstrate the importance of transrepressive PPAR? ligand-dependent signaling in regulating anti-tumor immune responses. It will also provide mechanistic insight into how PPAR? activation acts to suppress tumorigenesis and promote anti-tumor immune responses and provide a rationale for the use of transrepressive PPAR? ligands as chemopreventive agents or as an adjunct to current radiotherapy."

For this renewal of the Program Project, the Science core will provide: i) Full length and truncated versions of the prion protein (PrP) and tau for infectivity experiments (Project 1), and structural studies including fiber diffraction (Project 2), chemical crosslinking (Project 3), and small angle X-ray scattering (Project 4). ii) Solid phase synthesis of amyloidogenic peptides including wild-type and mutant A? and tau, for infectivity (Project 1) and structural (Projects 2-4) studies. iii) Anti-PrP and anti-tau antibodies will be required for biochemical characterization in Projects 1 and 2. In addition, antibodies will be needed for histopathology to be performed in Core C (Neuropathology). iv) Mass spectrometry and isotopically labeled proteins. Mass spectrometry support will be essential for analysis of proteins from cross-linking studies (Project 3), for determining protein turnover rates in vivo from mice fed isotopically labeled diet (Project 1), and for identification of A? isoforms (Projects 1-4). v) The Animal core (Core D) will require screening to confirm transgenic status and genotype of animals to be used in experiments in support of Projects 1, 2, 3 and 4, which will be provided by the Science core. Leadership for the Core will be provided by Dr. Kurt Giles, an Associate Professor with over 20 years experience in neurodegenerative disease research, and by Dr Shenheng Guan, a Professor with over 20 years industrial and academic experience, who will act as co-director. Drs. Giles and Guan will be assisted by other scientists and research associates to provide the above functions."
"9480807","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics (DDT) Program provides a platform for integration of discoveries into the Winship translational pipeline and for development of new cancer diagnostic and therapeutic approaches with the premise that interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary interactions among DDT members advance effective anti-cancer strategies. The program is organized around four scientific themes: (1) Discovery, the discovery and thorough evaluation of therapeutic targets and novel small molecules; (2) Cancer Imaging, the development and/or utilization of in vivo imaging agents and technologies for drug delivery and for non-invasive diagnostic and therapeutic cancer applications; (3) Cancer Immunotherapy, the translation of innovative immune concepts and approaches into anti-cancer therapies; and (4) Developmental Therapeutics, human interventional trials for cancer using novel therapeutic strategies and individualized treatment options by functioning as a convergence point for translation of targets, imaging, therapeutic agents, and immunotherapies. These four scientific themes lead the program's activities and intra- and inter-programmatic research efforts through resources and infrastructure provided by Winship. Under the leadership of Haian Fu, PhD (leader) and Suresh Ramalingam, MD (co-leader) the DDT Program includes 56 core members representing 16 different departments within the School of Medicine (SOM), Rollins School of Public Health (RSPH), and Emory College. Between 2012 and the present this highly collaborative group of researchers published 1,122 cancer-relevant scientific articles. Of these, 296 (26%) were intra- and 273 (24%) were inter-programmatic collaborations, and 445 (40%) involved a collaboration with another cancer center or academic organization. As of March 31, 2016, DDT members held $28.4 million in annual total cancer-relevant research funding as awarded through Emory University, of which approximately $9.8 million (34%) was awarded directly from the NCI. In addition, DDT member Curran received $15M of NCI support as PI in a multi-PI format through the NRG Oncology Foundation. Built on Winship's enabling resources and infrastructure for effective drug and target discovery and their subsequent translational development and based on established interactions among members, the DDT Program is making major contributions to the development of efficacious diagnostic and treatment options for cancer patients."
"9552676","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Project Summary WNK kinases are a family of serine/threonine kinases (1). Mutations of WNK1 and WNK4 kinases result in pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA II), featuring hypertension, hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis (4). WNK kinases play an important role in maintaining electrolyte homeostasis (5). WNKs not only modulate sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) (6), sodium potassium chloride cotransporter (NKCC) (7; 8), potassium chloride cotransporter (KCC) (7), and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (9; 10), but also affect renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK) (11; 12). During the previous funding period, we showed that WNK4 inhibits the activity and protein expression of the BK channel, another major renal potassium channel (13), whereas WNK1 increases its activity and protein expression by inhibiting the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway (14). In kidney, BK channels are mainly expressed in the distal nephron (15; 16). Previous studies have shown that the kidney specific isoform of WNK1 (KS-WNK1) also plays an important role in the regulation of ROMK (17; 18). High potassium (K) diets affect ROMK and BK channels (16; 19; 20). Changes in dietary K also affect WNK kinase expression (17; 21). Our preliminary data showed that changes in dietary potassium affect BK protein abundance through a WNK1-mediated ERK 1/2 signaling pathway involving aldosterone. We found that KS-WNK1 inhibits BK protein expression. Our yeast-two hybrid screen using parts of WNK4 as baits reveals a interacting protein from the MAPK signaling pathway, i.e., RanBPM, a potential modulator of ERK 1/2. In addition, we found that 14-3-3 ? decreases BK protein expression while enhancing ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. Therefore, our overall hypothesis is that 1) WNK modulates BK channel protein expression via ERK 1/2 signaling pathway through its interaction with RanBPM and 14-3-3, and 2) aldosterone modulates WNK-mediated regulation of BK. To test this hypothesis we have proposed the following specific aims as seen in Figure 1: Specific Aim 1: Investigate the role of interactions among WNK4, WNK1 and KS-WNK1 in the regulation of BK channel activity and protein expression in both cells and mice. Specific Aim 2: Investigate the role of RanBPM in the regulation of BK protein expression in cells and ERK 1/2 knockout mice. Specific Aim 3: Characterize the 14-3-3-mediated reduction of BK protein expression by examining BK ubiquitination and degradation through an ERK 1/2 signaling pathway in renal epithelial cells. We will apply the methodologies of patch-clamp technique, cell biology, molecular biology, protein biochemistry and in vivo animal study to perform the proposed experiments. Further exploration of how WNK and its interacting proteins affect BK channel function as well as the elucidation of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of PHA II caused by mutations of WNK kinases will provide a novel view on the regulation of the potassium channel activity and K secretion involving WNK kinase signaling in this research field."
"9472242","CORE C: ABSTRACT This ADRC has comprehensive and demanding translational research objectives, for which the Data Management and Statistics (DMS) core must be able to efficiently collect, validate, integrate, and derive meaning from a complex array of data. Key questions about diagnosis, clinical features, natural history, interactions between genotype and phenotype, clinico-pathological relationships, and connections between structural and functional brain changes and neurobehavioral disturbances can only be addressed with sophisticated and comprehensive data structures, and with the support of a cohesive team of expert statistical personnel. Thus, the DMS Core for this ADRC has a particular mandate to support and facilitate our researchers' ability to link the complex, multilevel data we collect, and to approach that data with the sophisticated and appropriate recommendations for research design and analytic methods. In the next phase of this ADRC, we will incorporate new innovations to the DMS that will enable our researchers to better identify and integrate multilevel data collected through the ADRC, while enabling us to link ADRC data with other resources at UCSF. Historically, the UCSF Memory and Aging Center (MAC) has shown national leadership in developing data management systems that integrate a wealth of information from a variety of sources in order to better understand the etiology and treatment of dementia syndromes and promote translational research. The core mandate of this DMS is to ensure that: (1) the measurement of behavioral, cognitive, neurological, imaging and genetic information is supported by scientifically sound techniques that result in a consistent classification of information (i.e., results are reliable and reproducible); (2) that the observed phenomena are accurately recorded and reflected in the database; (3) that the database is secure, preventing unauthorized changes; (4) that analytical data sets are easily accessible to collaborating investigators within and beyond the ADRC; and (5) that meaningful patterns in the data are identified using appropriate and efficient research design and statistical methods. We plan to augment these core functions by elaborating our representation of multiple levels of neurological information in order to improve our ability to model complex patterns and associations in our patients. We have also enhanced our plan for delivery of statistical consultation and have added biostatistical personnel. These improvements will build upon the solid foundation that we have established, and ensure that we will continue to provide the program structure required for the highest level of data collection, management, quality control, and timely NACC data submission."
"9617571","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder, characterized by spontaneous recurrent nosebleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the brain, lung, liver or GI tract. While reduced expression of either endoglin (ENG) or activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) has shown to be associated HHT, the precise pathogenetic mechanisms underlying HHT remain elusive; and thus, while palliative care options for HHT patients are well established, curative treatment options for this malady is currently lacking. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop novel therapeutic reagents for treating HHT. We have previously shown that development of skin AVMs in adult mice require secondary insults such as wounding in addition to genetic predisposition by Alk1- or Eng-deficiency. Later we have shown that VEGFA could mimic the wounding effect, and that blockade of VEGFA with neutralizing antibodies was effective in alleviating wound-induced AVMs in the Alk1-iKO models. In agreement with these preclinical findings, bevacizumab has been shown to be effective for epistaxis of HHT patients. VEGFR1 has an antagonistic function for VEGFR2 signaling as a decoy receptor for VEGFA. We initially thought that angiogenic stimulation, e.g. endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, sprouting, migration, and tube formation, via VEGFR2 is the key VEGFA effect for AVM induction. If this were true, VEGFR2 inhibition would have a similar effect with VEGF neutralization for inhibiting AVM formation, while VEGFR1 inhibition would have no or enhancing effect on the wound-induced AVMs. Surprisingly, we found a completely opposite result from this expectation by the R1- and R2-specific inhibition experiment. This result suggests that the inhibition of angiogenic stimulation is not the key effect of VEGFA neutralization for inhibition of AVM formation. It also indicates that VEGFA via VEGFR1 signaling is critical for AVM induction in ALK1-deficient vessels. VEGFR1 is expressed in monocytes/macrophages, and is important for VEGFA- dependent migration of these cells. We showed that ALK1-deficient ECs increased in production of monocytes/macrophage-recruiting chemokines including CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL10, and Angiopoietin2 (ANG2) which plays an important role in activating Tie2-expressing macrophages (TEMs). Finally, we found that macrophage depletion by clodronate liposome dramatically inhibited wound-induced skin AVM development in Alk1-iKO model. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that macrophages are essential for the development of AVMs. We will test this hypothesis by utilizing genetic, pharmacological, and cellular approaches."
"9476767","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major determinant of mortality and morbidity in hospitalized veterans. Understanding the pathophysiology of AKI is essential for the development of therapy. This application proposes to study the role of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) in AKI. This protein is expressed exclusively in the kidney by cells of the thick ascending limbs (TAL) of Henle. In the last funding cycle, we uncovered a key role of THP in mediating a protective tubular cross-talk in AKI. We showed that THP regulates inflammatory signaling and injury to S3 segments, which are neighboring tubules to TAL in the kidney outer medulla. The immediate goal of the current proposal is to study the importance of the interaction of THP with S3 segments in regulating neutrophil infiltration in AKI. These studies will form the basis to transition into therapeutic applications. Indeed, the PI's long term goal is to understand how the role of THP can be modulated to treat veterans who develop AKI. The central hypothesis is that Tamm-Horsfall protein regulates the inflammatory response triggered by ischemic injury in the outer medulla; an effect that requires an interaction of THP with the surrounding tubular elements. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary and published data. The following specific aims will be used to investigate this hypothesis. Aim 1 will investigate the role of THP as a key regulator of neutrophil infiltration in the kidney after AKI. Aim 2 will study specific inflammatory pathways regulated by THP in the neighboring epithelium during kidney injury Aim 2 will investigate therapeutic modulation of THP to inhibit neutrophil influx and promote recovery after AKI This research will involve the use of THP knockout and wild type mice. The animal model used for AKI is renal ischemia-reperfusion injury achieved through renal pedicle clamping. Other techniques used in this work include: Immunofluorescence laser micro-dissection of specific tubular sections, Immunofluoresence confocal and intravital microscopy, flow cytometry, real time-PCR, western blot, various forms of chromatography and mass spectrometry. This research is innovative, because it will uncover novel regulatory functions for THP that may be relevant not only in kidney injury but also in other forms of acute or chronic renal disease. Future strategies that enhance the role of THP in the kidney will be of important therapeutic significance."
"9457149","The innate immune system serves is the first response to diseased cells and infectious agents. Natural Killer (NK) cells and macrophages are primary components of this system. Although their functions differ, they both require the expression of NKLAM (Natural Killer Lytic-Associated Molecule) for optimal function. Accordingly, elucidating the role of NKLAM in innate immunity has important biological and clinical significance.  NKLAM is up-regulated in NK cells upon exposure to tumor cells or cytokines that activate cytolytic function. NKLAM is up-regulated in macrophages upon exposure to bacteria or pro-inflammatory cytokines. We generated NKLAM-deficient (KO) mice; they have less NK activity than WT (wild type) mice. They exhibit greater tumor growth, tumor dissemination and metastasis than WT mice. NKLAM KO mice also have defects in macrophage anti-bacterial function in vivo and in vitro.  NKLAM is a member of a small, highly conserved, unique group of RING-in between-RING (RBR) E3 ubiquitin ligases. RBR E3 ubiquitin ligases play a key role in cellular physiology and are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders. There is great interest in drug discovery to target them. We identified key potential substrates of NKLAM-mediated ubiquitination, including the transcription factors STAT1 and c-myc, Bcl-2 and UCKL-1 (uridine cytidine kinase like-1), a protein that promotes tumor growth. The central nature of these substrates in cell signaling, growth and survival suggests that drug modulation of NKLAM has significant potential for treating cancer and infectious diseases.  We found that activated NK cells releases exosomes containing NKLAM. NKLAM+ exosomes promote tumor cell death in vitro. Preliminary data indicate that NKLAM+ exosomes enter target cells and deliver NKLAM. Important unanswered questions that will be addressed are the effect of NKLAM on critical substrates in effector cells and in target cells.  The role of NKLAM in macrophages is undoubtedly different from its role in NK cells in that killing of bacteria occurs intracellularly. Our ongoing studies suggest that NKLAM modulates the signaling events that activate the macrophage anti-bacterial program. A key regulator of this pathway is STAT1.  We will test the hypothesis that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of NKLAM plays a role in the anti-tumor and anti-microbial functions of NK cells and macrophages with the following three interconnected but independent aims:  Aim 1: Elucidate the role of NKLAM in exosome-mediated killing of tumor cells. We will test the hypothesis that upon entry of NK-derived exosomes containing NKLAM into tumor cells, NKLAM interacts with critical substrates, resulting in cell death. We will test the ability of exosomes from NKLAM WT, NKLAM KO and NKLAM ligase defective NK cells to kill tumor cells in vivo using a mouse model of multiple myeloma, a disease increasing in frequency, especially in veterans.  Aim 2: Determine how NKLAM affects the anti-bacterial function of macrophages in vitro and in vivo. We will infect NKLAM KO and WT mice with S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, pathogens that are leading causes of disease. In light of increasing antibiotic resistance, the importance of these in vivo studies is magnified.  Aim 3: Identify the mechanism, sites and types of ubiquitination mediated by NKLAM. We will examine substrates important in tumor growth and anti-bacterial killing. This will provide a better understanding of the role of NKLAM in anti-tumor and anti-bacterial immunity and reveal key regulatory steps susceptible to therapeutic interventions for diseases that afflict our veteran population."
"9503400","PROJECT SUMMARY Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent forms of malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in men. Uncovering novel mechanisms that control prostatic tumorigenesis may advance development of more effective therapeutics to treat this life-threatening disease. Heparan sulfate (HS), a type of polysaccharide, is an essential component of the cell microenvironment and plays an important role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction and signaling. Recent studies reported that expression of HS-synthesizing and modifying genes are dysregulated in human PCa specimens. Currently, it is not known what causes this aberrant HS expression, and, more importantly, what are the functional consequences of the aberrant HS expression in prostatic tumorigenesis. In this application, we propose to test our novel hypothesis ?Pten-loss in prostate leads to aberrant HS expression creating a unique cellular environment that potentiates prostatic tumorigenesis? by pursuing the following three Specific Aims: 1. Determine if aberrant HS expression in human prostate epithelial cells is induced by Pten-loss and correlates with malignancy of Pten- null human PCa; 2. Determine if aberrant HS expression induced by Pten-loss potentiates prostatic tumorigenesis; 3. Determine if aberrant HS expression induced by Pten-loss potentiates PCa-associated inflammation. The proposed studies will use both novel and established genetic, cellular, biochemical and bioinformatics approaches in conjunction with in vitro cell function and in vivo human and mouse PCa models. These serial investigations are anticipated to delineate a novel mechanism that drives aberrant HS expression in PCa, reveal the aberrant HS expression to be a novel biomarker for PCa early diagnosis and prognosis, and elucidate the pivotal roles and their underlying molecular mechanisms of the aberrant HS expression in prostatic tumorigenesis, which likely will contribute to the development of novel therapeutics for PCa treatment."
"9475290","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite compelling experimental evidence linking inflammation to the pathogenesis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), anti-inflammatory clinical trials have systematically failed to demonstrate beneficial effects in patients. This failure is often ascribed to the interrelated prospects that pan-suppression of inflammation is deleterious or that anti-inflammatories also inhibit protective stress responses. Thus, identifying novel targets to treat ARDS requires an understanding of the basic biology underlying key molecules that drive both pro-inflammatory responses in immune cells and protective stress adaptation programs in non-immune cells. Preliminary Data show that, in addition to inducing pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages, Caspase-1 protease activation protects Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cell (PMVEC) and Pulmonary Arterial Endothelial Cell (PAEC) barrier function in response to infection. Additional data presented herein support a model in which Caspase-1 degrades glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins in PMVECs and PAECs as a protective strategy that limits accumulation of advanced N-glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RS) induced by infection. Intriguingly, the model opportunistic pathogen (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and vasculotropic pathogen (Rickettsia prowazekii) used in these studies both deploy homologous secreted phospholipase A2 toxins (ExoU) that inhibit Caspase-1 activation. The proposed experiments will test the Hypothesis that Caspase-1 activation in PMVECs and PAECs elicits degradation of glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins as an adaptive stress response to protect barrier function. Specific Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms of Caspase-1 activation in PMVECs and PAECs by: 1.1) Defining the mechanisms by which PMVECs and PAECs sense infection at the level of Inflammasome signaling using a Split Venus fluorescence complementation reporter. 1.2) Determining mechanisms by which the ExoU secreted toxin inhibits Caspase-1 activation using phospholipase A2 signaling inhibitors. Specific Aim 2 will elucidate mechanisms of Caspase-1-induced stress responses in PMVECs and PAECs by: 2.1) Elucidating glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins degraded by Caspase-1 and validating targets by site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme function assays. 2.2) Determining whether Caspase-1 protects PMVEC and PAEC barrier function during infection. Molecular and pharmacologic approaches will be used to either down-regulate or up-regulate Caspase-1 followed by assessment of barrier function, AGEs, and RS. Inhibitors of glycolytic intermediates, AGEs, and/or RS will unveil their roles in barrier demise. Specific Aim 3 will correlate Caspase- 1 activation and mitochondrial function with ARDS patient outcomes by: 3.1) Measuring active Caspase-1 and mitochondrial respiration in immune cells and non-immune cells. 3.2) Correlating outcomes with patient mortality and ventilator-free days. Long-term impact on human health and translational potential lie in identifying targets for therapies to treat ARDS, which are currently lacking."

"9541834","Abstract Despite aggressive chemotherapy, surgical resection, and radiation therapy, glioblastoma (GBM) remains almost universally fatal. A recent randomized, control trial demonstrated RNA-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccines significantly prolong overall and progression free survival in patients with primary GBM. Moreover, this trial also demonstrated that dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes could be used a clinically meaningful predictor of patient response to treatment. This technique provides researchers a surrogate endpoint to develop enhanced dendritic cell vaccine protocols and could provide clinicians with a powerful tool to predict patient response to treatment just 48 hours after vaccination. However, the high regulatory requirements associated with standard methods of tracking cell migration limit future application of this technique. This project is designed to evaluate use of theranostic RNA-loaded nanoparticles (RNA-NPs) to enhance and track DC migration to LNs. Preliminary evidence indicates that RNA-NPs 1) stimulate potent DC activation 2) enhance DC migration to LNs, and 3) can be loaded with sufficient levels of iron oxide to be tracked with MRI. This study will test the hypothesis that RNA-NPs can be used to enhance DC migration to LNs, predict vaccine efficacy with MRI, and improve antitumor immune responses. These goals will be assessed with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine effects of RNA-NP loading on dendritic cell activation and migration to LNs Unique benefits of RNA-NP loading on DC activation will be assessed with genomic analysis of intracellular signaling pathways. Functional consequences of RNA-NP loading will be determined in a murine model of our vaccine protocol. Aim 2: Determine predictive utility of MRI-detected dendritic cell migration The sensitivity of MRI based detection of RNA-NP loaded DCs will be determined by correlating changes in MRI intensity to absolute counts of RNA-NP-loaded DsRed+ DCs in lymph nodes. The predictive value of MRI- detected DC migration will then be assessed in a murine glioma model. Aim 3: Evaluate efficacy of RNA-NP loaded dendritic cells in a murine model of GBM Mice will be vaccinated with RNA-NP-loaded DCs. Antigen specific T cell activation will be assessed with a T cell killing assay. Survival benefit over other DC preparation methods will be assessed in an aggressive temozolomide and radiation resistant murine model of high grade glioma. Significance This project promises to produce a powerful tool to enhance and predict long term survival in patients with GBM. The combination of a readily accessible imaging component with a robustly stimulatory nanoparticle formulation would allow streamlined manufacturing of a low cost, theranostic nanoparticle that would provide clinicians an unprecedented advantage in patient management."
"9548973","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary/Abstract Multiple sclerosis is a devastating disease of the central nervous system that affects thousands of US veterans. MS frequently initially presents as temporary tingling or numbness in extremities or blurred vision. However, with time these events result in an accumulation of deficits leading to irreversible motor, sensory and cognitive dysfunction. Presently, there are no cures for MS. Treatment are available but their efficacy is highly variable and loss of motor function appears irreversible. Although classically described as a demyelinating disease, more recent studies have shown that axonal pathology is prevalent in MS and that this axonal pathology may be responsible for the irreversible loss of function associated with the disease. Here, we present strong preliminary data that challenge this view of MS. We show that a specific domain along the axon, known as the axon initial segment is structurally disrupted independent of demyelination indicating that axonal pathology in MS is a primary event and not merely consequential to demyelination. Structural disruption of the axon initial segment is functional devastating to the CNS since it is within the initial segment where i is decided whether an action potential will be generated. If our hypothesis is current, then disease onset does not parallel demyelinating episodes but occurs significantly earlier. Although our findings could revolutionize the view of MS onset, more importantly, we present strong preliminary data that disruption of the axon initial segment is reversible. Presently, we provide morphologic data suggesting reversibility. In this proposal we will test functional reversibility. Together, the studies outlined in this proposal are designed to challenge the current thinking of MS onset and the pathologic mechanisms that mediate the earliest stages of the disease. Moreover, we will further investigate the possibility that dysfunction that results form MS is reversible."
"9457455","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The leading causes of blindness and low vision in the US include AMD, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. Current therapies offer few options to those suffering from late stages of these diseases. In order to explore possible therapies, it is important to use animal models with regenerative capabilities such as the chick embryo. Embryonic chicks regenerate their retina, following retinectomy, by reprogramming the remaining retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) as long as an inducing factor is present. This reprogramming process allows the RPE to dedifferentiate, proliferate and form a neuro-epithelium that eventually differentiates generating retina. The process of dedifferentiation is ke to understanding how RPE reprogramming works. RPE reprogramming utilizes a two-step dedifferentiation process where injury (retinectomy) stimulates the RPE to become competent to respond to inducing factors. We have identified several inducing factors that are able to reprogram the RPE to neural retina, however, the role for these molecules in RPE reprogramming remains unknown. In this proposal we will dissect the mechanisms by which inducing factors such complement components C3a, C5a and inflammation associated molecules including IL-6 and antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) reprogram the RPE. Specifically, we will explore if these factors/molecules exhibit interdependence, if they require common signaling pathways or if they regulate common target genes using similar or distinct epigenetic strategies. We will test the following hypothesis: Inducing factors direct RPE reprogramming and retina regeneration by initiating downstream signaling cascades such as MAPK, PI3K, Wnt and/or Jak/Stat pathways commonly activated by growth factor and G-coupled receptors. Through these pathways, the inducing factors epigenetically control common genes that regulate RPE reprogramming. The urgency for restoring vision lead the NEI to announce an audacious goal to restore vision through regeneration of neurons and neural connections in the eye and visual system. This study provides a model system where to test small molecules such as C3a, C5a, IL-6 and NAC to evaluate induction of retina regeneration and a platform where to dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this process. This work will have a significant impact on the field of regenerative medicine since the information obtained can be extrapolated to the process of retina repair in mammals including humans, and specifically on the potential reprogramming of human RPE to generate new neurons."
"9566608","Project Summary Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and ultimately fatal disorder for which two anti- fibrotic drugs, have recently been approved. Unfortunately, neither drug is curative While clinical trials have demonstrated that both drugs slow the rate of decline in lung function, responses are variable and side effects lead to discontinuation of drug treatment in up to 40% of patients in the first year. IPF therefore remains a chronic, fatal disease driving down quality of life and driving up health care utilization and costs. More effective therapies that will safely and effectively modify the course of IPF and restore quality of life are urgently needed. Dr. Joel Dudley and his team have used a data-driven approach to identify a robust connection between the transcriptomic perturbations in IPF disease and those induced by saracatinib, a Phase 2-ready Src kinase in- hibitor. With this in silico data, Dr. Dudley has partnered with Drs. Gregory Downey (National Jewish Health) and Naftali Kaminski (Yale University) to validate and bring these findings to clinical application. Drs. Downey and Kaminski are each leaders in translational research and clinical care for IPF patients. Based on the tran- scriptomic findings, published literature, and preliminary evidence in the bleomycin preclinical model of this disease, we hypothesize that saracatinib, a Src kinase inhibitor, represents a new, targeted, more effective, and safer therapy for IPF than existing medications. In the UG3 segment of this proposal, we will examine the ability of saracatinib to perturb candidate biomarkers relevant to IPF pathogenesis. Computational analysis will be used to overlay the PBMC signature associated with poor prognosis in IPF, the IPF disease signature, and the saracatinib drug signature to identify candidate biomarkers for further study. These biomarkers will then be experimentally tested in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models. The key milestone for the UG3 to UH3 transition is identification of a panel of biomarkers associated with rapid IPF progression and saracatinib activity to sup- port the clinical study. These data will be rapidly integrated into a clinical study (UH3) designed to establish proof of concept and mechanism data in IPF patients. Full pharmacology and safety data are available to sup- port long-term administration of saracatinib with a favorable tolerability profile and potential for rapid translation into the clinic. The UH3 segment comprises a biomarker-based, adaptive design, integrated Phase 1b/2a trial of saracatinib in newly diagnosed IPF patients (100 patients total; 50 drug and 50 control) with an interim anal- ysis to check the biomarkers after the first 15 subjects reach 4 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment and adapt the design as necessary from that point (e.g. increase sample size or change drug dose). The primary endpoint for the trial will be change in the risk ratio (based on the 52-gene signature in blood leukocytes). The secondary end points will include change in HRCT chest scan quantification of fibrosis; slope of FVC; DLCO; 6-minute walk test; additional serum biomarkers including KL-6, MMP-7, osteopontin, collagen peptides, and additional serum biomarkers identified in the UG3; time to the first acute exacerbation, and quality of life questionnaires."
"9460466","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To date, one must conclude that the pace of progress in disease control and preservation of functional integrity and quality of life for pediatric brain  tumors remains below that of most other major types of childhood cancers. In translating multiple innovative therapies from the laboratory to early phase clinical testing in pediatric patients with CNS diseases, our future PBTC clinical trials will focus more on understanding genomics related to the treatment of these tumors, as well as pharmacogenomics in PBTC phase II trials. The OBC is in the process of converting the computing infrastructure that supports the PBTC to the MediData Rave system and will definitely have it in place by the time the new grant period starts. We have already begun to utilize the NCI-sponsored Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU) for regulatory support. Patient registration for all PBTC trials initiated in the new grant period will be via the CTSU Oncology Patient's Enrollment Network (OPEN). Thus, these changes will facilitate closer collaborations with the COG, which is using MediData Rave and the CTSU. This will facilitate providing data from PBTC trials to the COG for the implementation of subsequent trials. In addition, these systems provide a means for facilitating selected COG member institutions to participate in PBTC trials that require accrual of patients with very rare CNS tumors, as may be required for trials of new agents that target tumors with specific pathways activated or with specific genetic abnormalities. The Mission of the PBTC is to contribute rapidly and effectively to the understanding and cure of pediatric CNS tumors through innovative, multidisciplinary, multi-Institutional clinical trials based upon evolving knowledge of  brain tumor biology and using study designs and analyses based on state-of-the-art statistical science. The PBTC is committed to integrating clinical trials with correlative pharmacology, biology, neuroimaging and genomics studies. PBTC investigators recognize their profound responsibility to study the special needs of their patients and families, as they face enormous challenges during and after therapy."
"9684528","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to establish a CDC Comprehensive Prevention Research Center focused on health- promotion aligned with the disease-prevention objectives of Healthy People 2020. The proposed Health Promotion Research Center at Dartmouth (HPRCD) will leverage the strengths and reach of primary care and community mental health centers in New Hampshire (NH) to conduct dissemination and implementation research on health promotion strategies with a focus on the population health goal of reducing obesity and smoking. Our goal is to measurably decrease cardiovascular risk factors in NH by partnering with primary care, mental health, state agencies, and community partners to identify needs, provide technical assistance, implement, and study evidence-based practices that systematically address two of the CDC's primary Winnable Battles: obesity and smoking. Aim 1 of the HPRCD is to support the implementation and outcome assessment of evidence- based, clinically feasible health promotion interventions for obesity and smoking cessation as an integrated component in primary care settings across NH. We will accomplish this first aim by establishing a Comprehensive CDC Prevention Research Center with six core initiatives: 1) a primary care health promotion implementation workgroup; 2) a mobile health promotion technology workgroup; 3) a health promotion early research career mentoring program; 4) Dartmouth COOP Primary Care Research Network projects; 5) DH Community Health Improvement Plan projects; and 6) collaboration with the regional ReThink Health Initiative. The Center will support and complement these efforts by providing administration and infrastructure support; engaging community partners and providing technical assistance; communicating and disseminating knowledge; providing training in health promotion and implementation research; and evaluation of program outcomes. Aim 2 of the HPRCD is to evaluate long-term weight reduction, smoking cessation, and program sustainability of a statewide demonstration of integrated health promotion in mental health care settings across NH. We will accomplish this second aim by conducting a dissemination and implementation research project that will build on a novel, statewide Centers for Medicare and Medicaid demonstration program implementing integrated health promotion interventions in New Hampshire's Community Mental Health System. The proposed study will evaluate: 1) long-term reduced cardiovascular risk after program completion for 1,500 obese or tobacco dependent adults with mental illness; 2) facilitators of long-term weight loss and smoking cessation: and 3) the long-term sustainability and costs of integrated health promotion programs."
"9453024","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a debilitating and deadly disease of the pulmonary circulation; although relatively rare, PAH affects persons of every ethnic group, race, gender, and age, including newborns. Current anti-PAH medications (prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors) require cumbersome intravenous and subcutaneous injections, lack pulmonary selectivity, suffer from instability, produce systemic side effects, and fail to cur the underlying cause of the disease. Because PAH pathophysiology is entwined with multiple cellular and molecular pathways, single-drug therapy only modestly improves pulmonary hemodynamics and fails to restrain disease progression. Various combinations of anti-PAH drugs have recently been studied, but patient outcomes remain disappointing. Being predominantly vasodilators, the currently approved drugs do not reverse pulmonary vascular remodeling and abate right heart dysfunction, a major cause of deaths in PAH. We propose to circumvent indwelling catheter- and needle-based administration of drugs, intensify pulmonary selectivity, and reverse the pathogenesis of the disease to improve patient outcomes by formulating a combination of two drugs in nanocarriers equipped with a pulmonary homing device. We hypothesize that inhalable and targetable nanoparticles containing a vasodilator and an antioxidant will ameliorate pulmonary vasoconstriction, reverse pulmonary arterial remodeling, and abate right heart enlargement and failure in PAH. We will test this hypothesis by developing a targetable nanocarrier-based combination therapy that will simultaneously target two pathways of PAH pathogenesis: oxidative stress and Rho-kinase pathways. The system will consist of nanoparticles containing Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, a superoxide scavenger, and fasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor and potent vasodilator. The outer surface of the particles will be coated with a cyclic peptide, CAR (CARSKNKDC), that accumulates preferentially in the hypertensive pulmonary arteries of PAH rats. We have generated compelling preliminary data in support of the central hypothesis of this project, and documented the feasibility of the delivery system in peer-reviewed publications. We will use various cellular, intact organ and rodent models of PAH to generate preclinical datastepping-stones for development of an efficacious drug therapyand address an unmet medical need. This work is highly innovative because ligand-equipped inhalable particles containing two drugs will relieve PAH symptoms, eliminate the need for needles and catheters, diminish systemic vasodilation, reverse vascular remodeling, attenuate right heart dysfunction, ease economic burdens, free patients from discomfort, and improve quality of life. The investigative team, comprising experts from pharmaceutical, biomedical, chemical, and clinical fields, is highly qualified to conduct the proposed studies. Our long-term goal is to translate this formulation from bench to bedside and develop an effective therapy, which would transform the current treatment modalities for PAH."
"9465413","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Recent studies have found rapid and highly efficacious antidepressant effects of a single ketamine infusion in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, a single infusion appears insufficient to maintain response as most patients return to previous depressive state within a week. The strategy of multiple infusions to increase efficacy and sustain antidepressant effects has not yet been systematically evaluated in an RCT. The proposed study is a one-center, interventional, efficacy study designed to determine antidepressant outcomes of serial ketamine infusions compared to a single ketamine infusion among veterans with TRD. We have hypothesized that six infusions will be superior to a single infusion of ketamine in both decreasing severity of depressive symptoms and maintaining response. Participants will be male/female veterans (18 to 75 years old) of any era or military background who suffer from TRD defined as failure to achieve remission from at least 2 antidepressant trials of different pharmacological classes. Potential participants will be recruited from Mental Health clinics and screened for eligibility using a two stage process (phone/chart review, followed by interview). Exclusion criteria includes post-traumatic stress disorder, psychosis-related disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol/substance use disorder 6 months prior to screening; unstable medical illness; serious/imminent suicidal/homicidal risk; Parkinson's disease, dementia, seizures; traumatic brain injury; contraindicated medications (e.g., MAO inhibitors, barbiturates); received ECT during current episode; pregnancy/nursing. Baseline assessments will be completed 1-2 weeks prior to starting treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two parallel treatment conditions: 1) six ketamine infusions at 0.5 mg/kg or 2) single ketamine infusion at 0.5 mg/kg preceded by five midazolam infusions at 0.045 mg/kg. Midazolam was chosen as an active placebo given similar pharmacokinetics and dissociative effect profile to ketamine. Each intervention will be provided for a total of 12-day infusion-phase on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule. The, follow-up visits will occur at weekly intervals for the first 4 weeks, at 2-week intervals for the next 8 weeks, and at 4-week intervals for the remaining 12 weeks or until relapse. The primary end point is the Montgomery- ?sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score 24 hours following the last infusion where the peak antidepressant effects of ketamine occur. Secondary outcomes for the treatment phase include remission defined by MADRS<10, and response defined as a reduction in the baseline MADRS score e 50%. For the follow-up period, durability of antidepressant response will be defined by time to relapse to a MADRS score <50% of baseline at that visit. Independent evaluation of depressive symptom severity and potential covariates of antidepressant effect (e.g., pain intensity, level of anxiety) will be ascertained at baseline, at several time points during infusion period, and at follow-up. On the day of infusion, subjects will arrive in the morning after an overnight fast. Hemodynamic measures will be recorded every 10 min for 1 hour beginning 10 min before infusion. Subjects will then receive IV infusion over 40 minutes. Severity of depressive symptoms, pain intensity, level of anxiety will be obtained before and 24 hours after infusion. Acute dissociative effects, manic/hypomanic symptoms, and psychotomimetic effects will be measured 30 minutes before the start of each infusion and at the end of infusion (t0+40 mins) and again at t0+120mins and t0+180mins. The infusion will be discontinued in the event of significant adverse events. Procedures for the subsequent infusions at days 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 will be identical to those of the first infusion."
"9468373","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is one of the most common medical problems among older men ? affecting 33% of men by the time they reach 50 years of age and 75% by the time they reach the age of 80. LUTS is a progressive disease that has been shown to significantly increase the risk of depression and reduce quality of life. Due to this, early detection and active management of LUTS is critical. Uroflowmetry is an important test in the diagnosis, monitoring, and post-treatment evaluation of men with LUTS. Uroflowmeters are devices that generate graphs that characterize the volume and flow rate pattern of the void. From these graphs, physicians can identify the peak urinary flow (Qmax) which is the best single measure to predict whether or not a patient?s urine stream is obstructed. However, all uroflowmetry testing is currently being done in-clinic, which has limitations. First, having patients void in an artificial and unfamiliar clinic setting results in a different flow characteristic compared to having them void at home. Second, in-clinic testing results in a high number of uninterpretable voids when the patient isn?t able to void enough in the clinic. Uninterpretable voids are not billable by the care provider and the time spent attempting to collect this data in the clinic is wasted. In order to provide an alternative to in-clinic testing, Stream Dx, Inc. has developed and patented a low-cost, clinically accurate electronic flowmeter for at-home use. This uroflowmeter can generate the same volume and flow data that is collected by in-clinic uroflowmeters and can store multiple days? worth of patient void data in memory. Data collected on the device can then either be uploaded by the patient to our web-based portal for clinician viewing or, be uploaded by Stream Dx, Inc. after mailing the device back to the Company. In this Phase II Proposal, Stream Dx, Inc. plans to increase the usability of the Stream Dx uroflowmeter for patients and physicians. First, the Company will modify the existing device for handheld use to increase usability and compliance by patients. Second, the Company will develop mobile apps to capture intake and outflow data for patients and physicians to use in an at-home and in-clinic setting, respectfully. Third, data analytical tools will be developed on the Stream Dx website to provide physicians with additional methods of analyzing patient void data. Finally, the patient data will be integrated with the local hospital?s Electronic Health Record (EHR) for improved accessibility of the data by physicians."
"9500054","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Bacteria prevent viral infection by deploying CRISPR-Cas immunity, which features RNA-guided nucleases that recognize and cleave phage genomes with sequence specificity. Our understanding of the mechanisms and applications for these systems has advanced dramatically in recent years, however, our appreciation for the natural physiology of CRISPR-Cas interactions with phages is lacking. This proposal focuses on the discovery, characterization and evolution of the phage counter-response to CRISPR-Cas immunity. My lab has recently discovered ?anti-CRISPR? proteins produced by Listeria monocytogenes phages that inhibit CRISPR-Cas9 function through distinct mechanisms. While three of the proteins (AcrIIA2-4) interact directly with the Cas9 RNA- guided nuclease, AcrIIA1 functions in the absence of such an interaction. Moreover, acrIIA1 is the most widespread anti-CRISPR gene discovered to date, encoded by phages, non-phage mobile elements, and core genomes across the Firmicutes phylum. Preliminary evidence suggests that this protein represses the accumulation of Cas9 protein in the cell, suggesting a regulatory role towards biogenesis inhibition. No such regulatory protein has been previously described. AcrIIA1 possesses a predicted helix-turn-helix domain, which suggests a mechanism that may involve nucleic acid interactions. Interestingly, phages that infect L. monocytogenes do not possess just one anti-CRISPR gene, they often encode AcrIIA1, in addition to at least one of the inhibitor proteins (AcrIIA2-4). The functional importance of this apparent `multi-pronged' CRISPR- Cas9 attack is unknown. First, we will design isogenic phages to determine the contribution of multiple anti- CRISPRs to phage fitness, during lytic replication and lysogeny (phage integration). Second, we will determine whether AcrIIA1 makes direct interactions with any CRISPR-Cas9 promoter elements or RNA transcripts to interrogate its mechanism of action. Unbiased interaction profiling will also be conducted to fully capture AcrIIA1 biology. Lastly, given how widespread acrIIA1 homologs are, we will conduct comprehensive bioinformatics to determine the evolutionary origins of this protein superfamily and identify essential residues for function. Preliminary analyses have revealed an acrIIA1 homolog is found adjacent to a CRISPR-Cas9 operon in Lactobacillus, suggesting a functional linkage between acrIIA1 and endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 regulation. Additionally, we will utilize acrIIA1 as an anti-CRISPR marker to facilitate new anti-CRISPR discovery. This will contribute to our ultimate goal; identifying all CRISPR-Cas systems that are inhibited by phage anti-CRISPR systems. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 inhibitors provide new contributions to the gene editing toolbox, as a means to enact post-translational inactivation and limit off-target gene editing. Taken together, I propose that AcrIIA1 is a widespread CRISPR-Cas regulatory protein that bacteria and phage possess. We will determine its role, mechanism, and diverse reach, which will vastly expand our understanding of CRISPR-Cas biology, phage- host interactions, and contribute new reagents for CRISPR-Cas applications."
"8842091","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene with a prevalence of 1 in 3500 male births.  The consequent loss of functional dystrophin results in the progressive degeneration of skeletal and cardiac muscle. Despite significant progress in our understanding of this disease and advances in the development of new therapeutic approaches, DMD remains a fatal disease. Much of what is known about DMD has come from studying dystrophin-deficient animals, particularly murine and canine models. While useful for mechanistic studies, dystrophic mice fail to develop the muscle weakness phenotype that is typical of DMD in patients. The canine models are more representative of human DMD, but are difficult to study due to extreme phenotypic variability. The canine models also suffer from a limited choice of mutations, significant expense, and social acceptance concerns. Therapeutic strategies that have shown promise in these models have yet to be successfully translated to the clinic.  An animal model that more accurately and consistently replicates the clinical manifestations of human DMD is sorely needed.  Our objective is to create an improved model of DMD in the pig.  We believe a porcine model offers several advantages over the existing models.  Gene targeting is now available in pigs and would provide an opportunity to engineer patient-relevant mutations.  Porcine cloning technology would allow the production of genetically identical dystrophic pigs and could yield reduced variability in phenotype severity.  Also, pigs are less expensive to produce and easier to house than dogs and don't face the same ethical concerns as companion animals. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and commercialize DMD-targeted pigs as a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  We intend to accomplish this by combining gene targeting and somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a porcine model harboring a common human DMD mutation. This proposal outlines our plans for the creation and characterization of DMD-targeted pigs. Characterization will include an assessment of the molecular and biochemical consequences of dystrophin deficiency as well as a functional evaluation of the skeletal and cardiac muscle phenotype. We will also validate the DMD pig as a translational model by testing a nucleic acid-based therapy. This animal model will provide the academic and commercial research communities an opportunity to better understand DMD and to develop and test new therapeutic strategies"
"9417056","Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the U.S. We propose a 3-year renewal of the Longitudinal Investigation of Thromboembolism Etiology (LITE), a prospective study of VTE in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) cohorts, involving 21,680 participants followed for more than two decades. In the previous four project periods, during which 1,055 VTEs occurred, we successfully identified or clarified, via 91 publications, multiple genetic and non-genetic risk factors for VTE. We plan to build upon these findings during this continuation, by adding VTE cases, addressing new hypotheses related to VTE risk factors or outcomes, and using the information from all project periods to improve understanding of VTE occurrence.  LITE renewal aims are to: (1) Extend VTE event follow-up in ARIC for 4 more years, increasing the number of LITE VTE events by 262, to a total of 1,317. (2) Explore in depth possible reasons for the higher rates of VTE incidence in African Americans than whites, and systematically test for clinically relevant race interactions with risk factors for VTE. (3) Test the prospective association of incident VTE with novel biomarkers available at no additional cost: plasma galactin 3, sex hormones, and changes in plasma NT- proBNP, troponin T, and C-reactive protein. (4) Measure plasma high molecular weight kininogen and prekallikrein, components of the contact pathway of coagulation, and determine their association with VTE. (5) Test the prospective association of VTE with blood-based biomarkers of accelerated aging?shorter teleomere length and lower mitochontrial copy number. (6) Study the long-term consequences of VTE on physical functioning and quality of life.  LITE is one of the few and most productive US prospective studies on VTE. A 3-year renewal will allow LITE to contribute new information on VTE risk factors and outcomes, with potential implications for VTE prevention and treatment."
"9471313","The role of the cytokine SDF-1 (CXCL12) in bone marrow mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (BMSCs) function and bone homeostasis was the focus of our previous work in the original PO1 Project 3. The novel outcomes from those studies are driving the current goals in this competitive renewal. The mechanisms involved in aging-related osteoporosis remain poorly defined, however, recent studies from our group, and others, suggest that it is a stem cell disease. A critical problem is that aging triggers impaired localization, proliferation, survival, and differentiation of the osteogenic progenitor cell population in the bone marrow (BM), specifically BMSCs. A critical barrier to preventing these changes is identifying key regulatory pathways, and being able to alter or correct them. Our goal is to use information generated from our original PO1, where we have identified epigenetic changes in a subset of miRNAs in BMSCs, and to target these miRNAs to limit, or reverse, bone loss. Age-associated changes in SDF-1 systemically alter epigenetic regulatory systems, specifically miRNAs, in BMSCs, which in turn directly, and via nutrient signaling pathways, affect cell survival, osteogenesis and bone formation. SDF-1 is tightly regulated translationally, transcriptionally, and post- transcriptionally. We have identified age-associated changes in the SDF-1 axis. Here we show that SDF-1 is not only a target of novel age-associated miRNA epigenetic regulation, but itself alters expression of miRNAs that change with age in BMSCs and target the SDF-1 axis. Significantly, a key miRNA that we identified to increase with age in BMSCs (miR-29b-1-5p) belongs to the miR29 family of miRNAs that have been shown to be critical in extracellular matrix homeostasis and osteogenesis. What is novel, and a challenge to the existing paradigm, is that miR29b-1-5p is the ?passenger strand?, which is normally thought to be degraded leaving the complementary miR-29b-1-3p ?guide strand? as the functional miRNA. Understanding the mechanism that drives this previously unknown age-associated increase in the passenger strand is a critical goal because we have demonstrated that miR29b-1-5p regulates SDF-1 expression and suppresses BMSC osteogenesis and survival pathways. We propose to test the hypothesis that the elevated age-related levels of circulating SDF-1 and decreased bone marrow compartment levels and activity regulate the increased expression of miR-29b-1- 5p and downstream effects on bone homeostasis. Our objectives are to test new hypotheses derived from the findings of the original PO1 by manipulating the miRNAs we identified as changing with age in human/murine BMSCs to determine their effects on bone formation and turnover in vivo and at the molecular level on BMSC osteogenic function. We will test novel methods to reduce expression of these miRNAs, including altering nutritional pathways leading to bone loss by using specific forms of dietary amino acid and delivering synthetic anti-miRNAs to inhibit them. The impact of this project will be demonstrating the role of age-associated changes of BMSC miRNAs and identifying novel targets for reducing, or reversing, age related bone loss."
"9480802","CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT The Winship Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) unit provides the infrastructure for clinical research conducted at Winship. CPDM has three main objectives: supporting the safe and ethical conduct of clinical research; promoting the generation of high quality data; and increasing access to clinical trials for subjects in the Winship catchment area, with an emphasis on underrepresented populations. CPDM includes the Winship Clinical Trials Office (CTO), clinical data management team, regulatory specialists, quality assurance team (QAT), and the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The CTO provides the infrastructure for all aspects of trial conduct including design, regulatory processes, activation, conduct, data collection, and analysis. The CTO also provides training and education in clinical research for Winship members and staff. The clinical data management team and the regulatory specialists are organized in cancer disease site-based teams. Teams have dual reporting to the physician leaders of the respective disease site-based teams and to the CTO assistant directors. The CTO has a specialized team focused on the conduct of multi-institutional trials for which Winship investigators serve as PI's. This team coordinates trial conduct and provides on-site or remote monitoring of participating institutions. The Winship trial portfolio has an intentional distribution of institutional, industry- sponsored, externally peer-reviewed, and NCI-supported National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) trials. The QAT coordinators audit institutional and NCTN trials in real time to ensure compliance. The DSMC oversees the implementation of the Winship data safety and monitoring plan. The primary focus of the DSMC is to ensure the highest level of compliance in the institutional, NCI-funded, and NCTN trials. Recent analyses of trends of measurable outputs reveal significant improvements in key measures of Winship clinical trial conduct including accrual to trials, reduced trial activation times, and compliance with study protocol requirements. During the present funding period, Winship has developed new research-related standard operating protocols (SOP), improved staffing of the CTO to meet the growth in clinical trials accrual, and implemented clinical trials data management software. A software solution for biospecimen tracking and another software system for radiologic response evaluation have been implemented during the current funding period. During the next funding period, Winship will increase patient accrual to clinical trials with an emphasis on the affiliated Winship facilities, develop stronger clinical research infrastructure at those sites, increase underserved populations' access to clinical trials, increase clinical trial access within the Winship Cancer Network, and improve clinical trials informatics platforms."
"9527392","Project Summary  People with Down syndrome (Ds), and other intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), are at greater risk for stressful life experiences and depression than the general population, yet are less likely to be diagnosed and receive appropriate treatment. The lack of validated assessment tools for this population is a major impediment to research, diagnosis, and treatment of depression for people with Ds. The overarching goal of this K08 proposal is to provide the candidate, who is a clinical psychologist, with the training, mentorship, and research opportunities necessary to combine psychometric and genomic research methodologies to study biomarkers of stress and depression in populations that are challenging to assess, thus supporting the candidate's long-term goal of conducting federally-funded genomically-informed measurement research in people with Ds and other forms of IDD. The candidate and mentorship team have created a comprehensive training plan including coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, and conferences in Ds-related developmental and psychiatric phenotypes, statistics, and epigenetic biomarkers. The multidisciplinary mentorship team is comprised of leading experts: Dr. Colleen Jackson-Cook (clinical cytogeneticist and medical geneticist; primary mentor), a leading expert in epigenetics and cytogenetics of Ds; Dr. Ananda Amstadter (clinical psychologist; co-mentor), an expert in stress and depression; and Dr. George Capone (co-mentor), an expert in Ds developmental phenotypes. The mentorship team is rounded out by Dr. Accardo, board certified developmental pediatrician with expertise in developmental disabilities, and Drs. Aggen, and York, who provide expertise in phenotype measurement, statistical genetics, and bioinformatics.  The candidate will apply the acquired skills by conducting a multistage, multi-method measurement study of stressful life events and depression in people with Ds. The first stage will involve the preliminary psychometric analyses of self-report, caregiver-report, and clinical diagnostic data from a sample of 75 participants with mosaic Ds (mDs), whose higher cognitive and verbal functioning can provide a ?window? into the social and emotional experiences of people with Ds. This data will be used for measure refinement for deployment in the second stage in which the refined assessments will be administered and validated within a sample of 100 participants with complete (non-mosaic) Ds. The third stage will involve a comparison of genome-wide methylation and telomere length in participants with complete Ds diagnosed with depression (cases; n=25) and without (controls; n=25) to identify potential biomarkers of depression. Furthermore, the role of stressful life events will be explored in the biological embedding of depression. The identification of these biomarkers will not only complement the validation of patient-reported assessment tools, they may also serve as cost-effective diagnostic tools in their own right and play a vital role in differential diagnosis and future research on pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for depression in this population."
"9412783","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The primary goal of this research is to gain novel insights into how Interleukin (IL)-33 and the IL 33 receptor are involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, an often-debilitating inflammatory disease of the skin that affects over ten million Americans, including Veterans. Cytokines are an important class of inflammatory proteins produced by many cell types including keratinocytes. Interleukin 33 is a cytokine produced by keratinocytes and other cell types and is implicated in atopic dermatitis and another common inflammatory disease of the skin, psoriasis. Unlike most cytokines, IL-33 also has intracellular functions in the nucleus where it may regulate gene expression. This work will evaluate the mechanism(s) by which IL-33 and the IL-33 receptor regulate the atopic dermatitis-like phenotype in Stat6VT transgenic mice, a T cell-dependent mouse model of disease. These studies will also be extended to involve patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Use of T1/ST2 (i.e. the ligand-specific subunit of the IL-33 receptor) knockout mice will help determine if the immunoregulatory effects of IL-33 on the atopic dermatitis-like phenotype in Stat6VT mice are mediated by the IL-33 receptor. Adoptive transfer experiments will be performed to determine if regulatory T cells contribute to immunoregulation of the atopic dermatitis-like phenotype in Stat6VT mice in an IL-33 receptor-dependent manner. Skin-derived CD4+ T cells from patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (and healthy controls) will be isolated to study the impact of IL-33 on effector cytokine production by these cells. The roles of IL-33 and the IL-33 receptor in epidermal barrier function and keratinocyte differentiation will be evaluated using IL-33 and T1/ST2 knockout mice. Similar studies will be performed with using human keratinocytes in which IL-33 and IL-33 receptor expression are modulated using lentiviral systems to force and/or attenuate expression of IL-33 and T1/ST2. In conclusion this project is designed to advance the understanding of how IL-33 and the IL- 33 receptor are involved in atopic dermatitis and extend our studies to psoriasis, two of the most common inflammatory diseases of humans.

"9551507","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Thyroid carcinoma is the most frequently occurring endocrine cancer. Most thyroid cancers are successfully treated with surgery and radioiodine (131I). However, poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) loses its ability to take up radioiodine leading to disease recurrence and death. Additionally, patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) show very poor prognosis and survive for less than 6 months. These findings hold true for veterans as well; moreover, veterans could be at a higher risk for developing thyroid cancer due to their previous exposure to radiation and the enhanced risk of potential exposure to radiation amongst individuals who serve in the US armed forces. Therefore, a treatment that can selectively kill tumor cells that are unresponsive to radioiodine treatment and the anaplastic thyroid cancer cells is highly desired. TRAIL is one such potential therapeutic agent.  TRAIL is a cytolytic drug that can selectively kill cancer cells while sparing most normal cells. However, its clinical utility in cancer treatment has been limited due to the expression of TRAIL-resistance factors. Map kinase Activating Death Domain containing protein (MADD; a.k.a. IG20) can confer resistance to TRAIL- induced apoptosis in a variety of thyroid and other cancer cells. While knockdown of MADD in cancer cells rendered them more susceptible to apoptosis, it had no apparent effect on normal cells, suggesting that it might serve as an ideal target for developing cancer therapy. The ability of MADD to act as a TRAIL resistance factor is dependent upon it's phosphorylation by Akt (i.e. pMADD). Interestingly, in TRAIL sensitive cancer cells, TRAIL treatment reduced the levels of pAkt and pMADD, while they remained unaltered in TRAIL- resistant cells. However, reducing the pMADD levels by suppressing the Akt activity restored TRAIL sensitivity to TRAIL resistant cells.  This is profoundly interesting because the most aggressive forms of thyroid cancers, such as PDTC and ATC, show constitutive activation of Akt due to activating mutations in Ras or Akt1, PIK3CA gene amplification or inactivating mutations in PTEN, which can enhance tumor survival and growth. The PI3K/Akt signalling pathways are attractive therapeutic targets and drugs that can suppress this signaling pathway are in clinical trials. However, most of these are cytostatic and not cytolytic and thus allow tumors to persist, develop resistance and metastasize. Thus there is need for developing newer modalities of effective treatment.  A clearer understanding of the role of pMADD, in regulating apoptosis of ATC cells could enable us to develop effective methods to kill them. We hypothesize that TRAIL can be used to effectively kill most anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. However, in TRAIL resistant anaplastic thyroid cancer cells, MADD function can be repressed to sensitize them to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To test this hypothesis in Aim-1 we will determine if Akt phosphorylation of MADD contributes to TRAIL-resistance in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells; in Aim-2 we will test the in vivo therapeutic utility of down modulating MADD function in anaplastic thyroid cancer using an orthotopic xenograft athymic nude mouse model; and in Aim-3 we will determine the levels of MADD and pMADD in anaplastic thyroid cancers and see if they correlate with TRAIL-resistance of primary cells derived from those cancers.  Apoptosis induced by TRAIL as well as by MADD down modulation is primarily seen in cancer cells and not normal cells. Therefore, the proposed novel studies on down modulating MADD function in anaplastic thyroid cancer to enhance TRAIL sensitivity is of high clinical significance and highly relevant to VA mission."
"9447193","ABSTRACT: Individuals with sickle cell disease exhibit cardiovascular manifestations and sudden death as the top causes of premature death. These factors, unfortunately, contribute to the plateauing of the average life expectancy of these patients (in the 4th decade) over the past two decades, yet another profound health disparity observed in African Americans (AAs). Despite expanded understanding of the defining features including systemic vaso-occlusive episodes and hemolysis, there is a paucity of information linking cardiac pathology to premature death. Using system biology approaches, we have generated highly novel information characterizing a previously unrecognized human sickle cardiomyopathy defined by myocardial fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, prolonged repolarization, and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the ?humanized? sickle mouse model. These studies further demonstrated significant upregulation of circulating IL18 gene expression, an established inflammasome and pro-fibrotic mediator upregulated by free heme, in sickle cardiomyopathy. Additionally, exposure to IL-18 was a key factor in inducing VT in sickle mice. Preliminary data further link decreased expression and activity of cardiac potassium channels (KCND2/KCND3) in sickle mice, which can prolong repolarization, to acute increases in IL-18-mediated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression, the latter a key source of reactive oxygenation species (ROS) and induction of cardiac apoptosis. We have further shown that chronic IL-18 inhibition reduces cardiac apoptosis, fibrosis and improves diastolic function in sickle mice coupled with reduced cardiac IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and Nox4 expression. Finally, our genomic studies have identified novel polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with enhanced IL18 expression and prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval, an established risk factor for VT. Thus, via three specific aims (SAs), this R01 will interrogate the mechanistic basis for the hypothesis that IL-18/IL- 18R/Nox4 signaling critically downregulates KCND2 and KCND3 function acutely and promotes myocardial fibrosis with sustained activation, exacerbating sickle cardiomyopathy and VT development. SA #1 will functionally validate heme-mediated IL18 promoter regulation including SNPs in a monocyte cell line. SA #2 will define how IL-18/IL-18R/Nox4 signaling acutely downregulates KCND2/KCND3 function leading to prolonged repolarization and chronically, results in cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis. SA #3 will define the therapeutic efficacy of strategies to prevent sickle cell-associated inducible VT. The knowledge gained from this R01 will directly translate into future clinical biomarker studies evaluating risk of sudden cardiac death highlighting those patients with a higher hemolytic burden, pathogenic IL18 SNPs, and circulating IL-18 levels with theoretically higher VT risk. Additionally, the data will test for effective and novel personalized therapies in a poorly recognized and fatal manifestation of sickle cell disease."

We will facilitate their exposure to science, academia and careers as researchers. The program will provide 25 undergraduates with faculty mentoring, customized advising, extracurricular experiences and opportunities for communicating with engaged peers each year during the course of the project period. We have assembled a dedicated group of research-active mentors who will provide our students with hands-on research training. Our management and assessment plan will measure and ensure program and student success. We will provide a highly personalized experience to the students so that they can become the successful science leaders of tomorrow, and thereby, improve the diversity of research scientists. Furthermore, we provide documentation of the effects our program has had upon students. Our program will continue to help students to build strong, highly competitive applications for doctoral programs so that they will directly enter into STEM Ph.D. programs (we have an average direct Ph.D. acceptance rate of 88.2% in the last 5 years). To accomplish our goals, we plan to (1) provide year-round mentored research experiences that will allow 25 IMSD undergraduate students to acquire excellent research and laboratory skills, (2) continue with our Pre-IMSD Program to recruit STEM freshman/sophomore students early (unfunded by IMSD) to introduce biomedical research and the pathway to preparing for graduate school, and (3) develop the critical thinking and oral and written communication skills of all program participants, by providing opportunities to present their research before professional audiences and to contribute to manuscripts for publication. We also propose aims related to program evaluation including (1) to systematically measure program outcomes with mixed methods of quantitative and qualitative data collection and the establishment of a comprehensive electronic tracking database, (2) to use the data to continuously improve the program by maintaining elements that are most effective, and (3) to communicate the success of the SDSU IMSD Program."
"9456671","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease that is very difficult to diagnose. The high mortality of this disease is predominantly due to the advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis and a lack of effective treatments. Due to the low prevalence of pancreatic cancer (0.01%), early detection would be most cost-effective in screening increased-risk populations, such as new-onset type-2 diabetics. Clinical and research studies have substantiated the link between pancreatic cancer and new-onset type-2 diabetes. Development of a highly accurate blood-based test to detect pancreatic cancer in this population would represent a breakthrough in early detection of pancreatic cancer. Such a blood test, if used on an annual basis in this higher-risk population, could serve as an effective and inexpensive method for initial targeted screening. In this project, we proposed to develop and characterize a blood-based proteomics signature that allows early detection of pancreatic cancer patients with new-onset diabetics. The Specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1: unbiased global discovery of differential proteins associated with pancreatic cancer in the blood of diabetic patients using quantitative proteomics; Specific Aim 2: development of targeted proteomics assay for 35 selected biomarker candidates; Specific Aim 3: establishment of a proteomics signature (biomarker panel) for detecting early stage pancreatic cancer in diabetic patients; Specific Aim 4: evaluation of the proteomics signature in detecting pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic patients. This proposal builds on our decade-long systematic study of pancreatic tumorigenesis, the rich resource of previous discoveries in pancreatic cancer biomarker development, well-characterized study cohorts from different institutions, as well as cutting-edge proteomics platform technologies that we have developed and implemented. Successful development of a blood-based assay to facilitate the early detection of pancreatic cancer for diabetic patients would alleviate the current prolonged work-up of higher-risk populations and provide critically important interception opportunities to treat earlier stage cancer."
"9555873","Project Abstract This SBIR Phase II proposal is based on our strong pre-clinical data and SBIR phase I results, and will support a Phase II clinical trial to examine the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of PDMX1001 (niclosamide) with abiraterone for the treatment of enzalutamide-resistant Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), and conduct molecular correlative studies. Our goal is to develop a novel treatment strategy for advanced prostate cancer by targeting both full-length androgen receptor (AR-FL) and androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) signaling. Abiraterone and enzalutamide are frequently used in treating CRPC. However, the response duration is usually short, and resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide is the most common cause of treatment failure. Even though both drugs are often effective initially, after CRPC develops resistance to one drug, the response rate to the other drug is around 20% or less. Considerable evidence from both clinical and experimental studies demonstrated that AR-V7 plays vital roles in induction of resistance to both drugs. AR-V7 is not targeted by either abiraterone or enzalutamide. Therefore, there is urgent need to develop novel agents that target AR-V7 to overcome resistance. We discovered PDMX1001 as a potent inhibitor of AR-V7, and obtained extensive preclinical data showing that PDMX1001 synergizes abiraterone in treating CRPC. Based on our previous pre-clinical findings, we conducted a Phase Ib clinical trial (NCT02807805) funded by an SBIR Phase I grant (1R43CA206668-01) and confirmed that the PDMX1001 and abiraterone combination treatment is safe and effective in CRPC patients. The promising SBIR Phase I results lay foundation for this SBIR phase II study to conduct a single-arm Phase II clinical trial to determine the efficacy and toxicity of the combination therapy of PDMX1001 and abiraterone in enzalutamide resistant CRPC patients. We will also conduct molecular correlative studies in these patients. This project, if successful, is high yielding and will greatly benefit hundreds of thousands of prostate cancer patients every year."
"9458114","?    DESCRIPTION:  Despite aggressive peri-operative antibiotic treatments, between 1 in 20 and 1 in 100 patients undergoing spinal surgery develop an infection. For patients with traumatic injury, these rates easily exceed 10%. With > 5 million annual surgeries by 2030 and only partially effective infection treatments, the cost and disability due to infection will continue to mount. More effective means to prevent infection are therefore a clinical imperative. To be most effective, new treatments must eradicate pathogens before their adherence to the implant surface attenuates antibiotic and immune susceptibility. Aware of this requirement, our laboratories have long focused on new ways to create antibacterial implant systems that prevent bacterial colonization. Our hypothesis is that maintaining supra-therapeutic antibiotic concentrations at the hardware site during the peri-operative period will prevent establishment of infection and lower infection rates. To test this, we propose to develop a simple porous polyether ether ketone (PEEK) sheath that surrounds the spinal rod and releases its contents--mg quantities of a combination of antibiotics--upon application of ultrasound (US); all antibiotics will be released from sheaths during the peri-operative period to ensure aggressive prophylaxis. Use of antibiotic combinations is expected to minimize antibiotic resistant pathogens and to ensure that all contaminating pathogens are eradicated. There are three specific aims 1: To characterize the stability and release kinetics of an US-activated antimicrobial release system. 2: To test the ability of the sheaths to prevent bacterial colonization of adjacent hardware in vitro. 3: To determine the utility of the sheath in eradicating infection in an in vivo model of infection. The approach detailed in this application ensures eradication of pathogens in the immediate post-operative period. The concept and impetus has arisen through the efforts of a spinal surgeon, US physicist, basic scientist (implant infections), and biomaterials engineer (PEEK and implant retrieval and analysis). It directly addresses the problem of spinal implant infections using innovative applications of proven materials that upon completion of this project can quickly and effectively be translated to the clinical arena. We anticipate that this therapy wil further lower infection rates and ameliorate the pain, suffering, disability, and mortality associated with infections that occur after spinal surgery."
"9309997","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men in the United States, which disproportionately affects African Americans (AA) with higher incidence, advanced disease and worse prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that represent universal gene regulatory mechanism exerting its effect primarily by binding to 3'UTR of target and affect cell survival, proliferation, cancer initiation, development and metastasis. We recently reported differential expression of miRNAs in PCa tissues and body fluids. In this proposal, we present preliminary data on selected two miRNAs that are downregulated in age/disease matched African American (AA) when compared with Caucasian (CA) PCa tissues. We present preliminary data on modulation cancer cell growth, migration, anoikis, angiogenesis and modulation of EMT signaling. We have preliminarily identified several miRNA targets that may explain miRNA mechanisms in PCa progression. We report miRNA modulation of JNK1-Sp1 signaling which is known to modulate angiogenesis and metastasis. We hypothesize that differential loss of selected microRNAs in AA PCa deregulates an intricate signaling network, leading to aggressive phenotype. Further these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers to distinguish between indolent vs. aggressive disease (predominant in AAs) and serve as novel therapeutic targets. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to study the clinical significance of microRNAs and their targets in age/race matched PCa tissues and their adjacent benign regions and disease staged PCa TMAs; (2) to validate miRNA targets and delineate signaling mechanisms by generating miRNA gene deletions in AA and CA prostate cells by genome editing using [Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated (CAS) nuclease Cas9); (3) Investigate the role of microRNAs in experimental prostate carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo by studying their gain and loss of function in AA and CA prostate cancer cells and in vivo by examining the effects on tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model. Recognizing miRNAs as basis of PCa pathogenesis, disparity and understanding their biological implications will significantly impact diagnosis and treatment development for aggressive PCa common in African American men."
"9462793","Core F: iPS Cell Core Project Summary/Abstract Recent studies have uncovered a number of genes that can influence the risk of developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unknown exactly how these genes impact the function of cells and promote disease. It is also unknown whether drugs can be developed to target these genes in a beneficial way. The UCI Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) recently established the first AD induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell core to provide researchers with a powerful new approach to study the relationship between genetic risk factors and AD pathogenesis in human cells. iPS cells are a specialized cell that can be produced by adding 4 key genes to human skin or blood cells. The resulting cells can then be grown indefinitely and are pluripotent, meaning they can differentiate into any cell type within the body. By producing iPS cells from patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and unaffected controls, scientists can study the influence of disease-associated genes on key types of human cells such as neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. One major challenge is that researchers will likely need cells derived from many individual patients to study the effects of genes in a complex disorder such as AD. The UCI ADRC iPS core therefore aims to generate lines from over 140 individual patients. These iPS cell lines will then be made widely available to AD researchers worldwide to accelerate the discovery of novel therapeutics and enhance our understanding of the complex genetic components of AD."
"9541258","PROJECT SUMMARY  Evolution of antibiotic resistance is a global public health problem. How evolution renders antibiotic molecules ineffective by altering antibiotic targets is an interesting phenomenon from both clinical and basic science perspectives. In pathogenic bacteria, there is only a handful of drug target enzymes such as DNA gyrases, RNA polymerases, fatty acid synthetases, and enzymes involved in folic acid synthesis. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of resistance-conferring mutations in these enzymes is clinically critical for designing new drugs or drug variants that can inhibit resistant bacteria.  In this project, we propose to study evolution of the Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme and map epistatic interactions between DHFR mutations. DHFR is a ubiquitous enzyme with an essential role in the folic acid synthesis pathway and is used as a drug target in antibacterial, anticancer, and antimalarial therapies. In bacteria, an antibiotic named trimethoprim competitively binds to DHFR and blocks its catalytic activity. Therefore, DHFR mutations that either confer resistance or compensate for reduced catalytic activity of resistant DHFR mutants are selected for bacterial survival.  We will use laboratory evolution experiments to identify functional DHFR mutations and reproducible genetic trajectories leading to elevated trimethoprim resistance. We will characterize these mutations by using in vitro biochemical assays and deep-sequencing based fitness measurements for calculating epistatic interactions between DHFR mutations. We will use molecular dynamics along with other computational tools and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to reveal structural changes responsible for resistance and epistatic interactions. The combination of these approaches presents a unique opportunity to quantitatively evaluate evolutionary paths leading to trimethoprim resistance and create a discovery pipeline for studying protein evolution. By creating a deeper understanding for the evolutionary dynamics of an important drug target enzyme, our proposal will develop experimental and computational tools for studying protein evolution with the ultimate goal of improving human health. Indeed, our preliminary analyses suggest that we will be able to design and test novel trimethoprim derivatives that can selectively inhibit DHFR mutants that carry the L28R replacement, a common and synergistic DHFR mutation. We propose to synthesize trimethoprim-Dihydrofolate hybrid molecules that will possess the salient structural features of both DHF and trimethoprim molecules selectively inhibit DHFR mutants with the L28R replacement. We will evolve pan sensitive E. coli strains in the morbidostat in order to quantify the efficacy of the mutant specific trimethoprim derivatives in impeding resistance evolution and accordingly develop new strategies for better use of it."
"9553353","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The major limitation of lung cancer therapies that selectively target the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling network is the emergence of secondary drug resistance mechanisms. Currently, 40% of the cases of acquired resistance to EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) are mechanistically unexplained. However, there are still no effective therapies for Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) harboring the secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, which accounts for 50% of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in NSCLC carrying sensitive EGFR mutations. Recent reports as well as our own preliminary findings suggest that erlotinib, an EGFR TKI, induces cytoprotective autophagy in NSCLC cells that do not succumb to its antitumor activity. Thus, independent of the molecular mechanism(s) of resistance to erlotinib, cytoprotective autophagy is invoked to overcome the cellular stress brought about by this TKI. Such a shared adaptation response of NSCLC cells with distinct erlotinib resistance mechanisms may serve as a therapeutic target for tumor cells that currently do not have any other effective therapy. Furthermore, many of the current efforts to prevent or delay the development of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs incorporate a second agent with erlotinib in the first-line setting. In the current application, we propose to determine the therapeutic potentil of targeting a newly discovered mechanism of cross-regulation between autophagy and apoptosis as an additional component for the treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLC by erlotinib. Our preliminary studies identified a hitherto unknown complex between Atg7 and caspase-9, which is downregulated during apoptosis, but intensified during autophagy. Our preliminary data suggest that depending on the cellular context, each of the complex components cross-regulates the other's activity: while Atg7 represses the apoptotic activity of caspase-9, the latte enhances the autophagic activity of Atg7. In the current application, we propose to determine the clinical potential of a targeted disruption of the Atg7/caspase-9 complex, utilizing molecular insights produced by our preliminary studies. In particular, we suggest that a specific disruption of this complex will negatively impact the NSCLC autophagic response to erlotinib, while enhancing its apoptotic response via the removal of caspase-9 repression by Atg7. We propose 3 specific aims to test our central hypothesis that 'the Atg7/caspase-9 complex determines the balance between autophagy and apoptosis in the response of EGFR mutant NSCLC to erlotinib.' In Specific Aim 1, we plan to test the cross-regulation between Atg7 and caspase-9 in EGFR mutant NSCLC response to erlotinib. In Specific Aim 2, we plan to investigate the significance of the Atg7/caspase-9 complex as a target for sensitization of EGFR mutant NSCLC cells to erlotinib. In Specific Aim 3, we plan to advance the testing of the hypothesis to animal models. The proposed studies are highly innovative in both preliminary findings and potential clinical implications. The newly discovered Atg7/caspase-9 complex offers an exciting cross-regulation mechanism that may be utilized to enhance the apoptotic over the autophagic activity of erlotinib, and potentially extend its therapeutic benefit to a disease stage for which o other effective therapies are available."

It generates solutions to problems surrounding the environmental contamination of hazardous substances, and interrogates the risk these substances pose on human health."
"9684529","Project Summary/Abstract  The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Bureau of Family Health and Nutrition, the Title V agency in Massachusetts (MA), is continuing its Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) project activities. The goal of MA PRAMS is to provide relevant information about mothers' experiences and behaviors before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. MA has substantial information on the maternal and child health (MCH) population, but, nevertheless, gaps exist. For instance, although statistics on violence against women of childbearing age are provided by the MA Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS), PRAMS offers a unique opportunity to explore physical abuse during or around the time pregnancy, with data linked to birth outcomes.  Concerning other areas of interest, reliable data are even more limited or nonexistent. For example, MA did not have population based data on postpartum depression. However, new programs have begun to address maternal depression in MA. PRAMS data were used the in the drafting of a bill ?An Act Relative to Post Partum Depression.? Understanding the factors that relate to mothers' depression will be critical for developing and evaluating effective screening instruments. In addition, PRAMS data supported the selection of a mental health priority for the MA five-year MCH needs assessment. Some MA state Title V performance measures related to the MCH priorities, for example, the percentage of women with a recent live birth reporting that they had their teeth cleaned recently (within one year before, during, or after pregnancy) will be included in PRAMS for the next five years. Furthermore, MA will continue to collect information on influenza vaccination during pregnancy, with the objective to provide data on seasonal and H1N1 influenza vaccine utilization among pregnant women in MA and identify barriers for not receiving vaccination.  PRAMS data are also used to validate other data sources through data linkages, such as the Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) data. PELL links the birth certificate (BC) to their corresponding hospital discharge (HD) data. PRAMS data have been linked to the 2007 PELL data to compare PRAMS to the HD and BC data. Analyses comparing the levels of agreement around the occurrence of pregnancy- associated morbidities from each data source have been initiated."
"9552673","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women, and approximately 2.5 million American women with a personal history of breast cancer are alive today. Late stage cancer comes with a high risk of mortality, making BC the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the US. Despite major advances in screening and detection, BC is still a major killer of women and the identification of novel pathways to combat BC is urgently needed. The Ron receptor is overexpressed in ~50% of human BC and is an independent predictor of metastases and poor prognosis in women with this disease. While Ron overexpression is an important factor in human BC and metastasis, a significant gap exists in our knowledge about the mechanisms by which Ron promotes the development of aggressive disease. To examine Ron further, transgenic mice were generated that produce mammary-specific Ron overexpression. These mice, referred to as the MMTV-Ron mice, mimic the aggressive disease pattern observed in human patients with all female mice developing highly metastatic breast tumors. In this clinically relevant model, we discovered that mammary tumors upregulate the Ron ligand, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (HGFL), despite the presence of this growth factor in the circulation. Utilizing MMTV-Ron mice deficient in HGFL, our preliminary studies show the importance of HGFL for oncogenic Ron activation and mammary tumor growth and progression. Utilizing HGFL deficient mammary tumor cells, we show that reconstitution of HGFL promoted tumor cell autonomous survival, migration and invasion. Further, we show that global HGFL loss also dramatically affected the tumor microenvironment by regulating immune cell recruitment, macrophage polarization, breast cancer stem-like cell/tumor initiating cell (BCSC) numbers, and angiogenesis. Analysis of bone marrow derived macrophages shows that HGFL augments Stat3 activation and promotes the expression of markers of alternative macrophage activation, supporting a role for HGFL-induced Ron signaling in suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. These studies are further supported by recent reports showing that Ron signaling in myeloid cells, and specifically in macrophages, is critical for suppressing cytotoxic T-cell responses and promoting tumor growth. Combined, these data support both tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic functions for HGFL-induced Ron activation in promoting mammary tumor growth and metastasis. In this revised renewal application, we will directly define the functions of the Ron signaling pathway in macrophages and epithelial cells during breast tumorigenesis and will examine the significance of tumor cell produced HGFL in directing tumor growth and immunosuppression through autocrine and paracrine signaling. We will test the hypothesis that tumor cell produced HGFL promotes aggressive BC through the cooperative activation of myeloid and epithelial Ron signaling within the tumor microenvironment. To test this hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed: (i) to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which myeloid Ron signaling augments breast tumor growth; (ii) to determine the source and mechanism by which HGFL supports BC growth and metastasis, and (iii) to define the function of tumor cell-specific Ron expression in promoting breast tumorigenesis. In total, we hope to understand the role of the HGFL-Ron signaling axis in the development and spread of BC and provide a rationale for new diagnostic or treatment modalities that target both the tumor proper and immune response to mitigate BC mortality."
"9557607","Abstract  Serious non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Incidence of NVUGIB in the US is close to 50 events per 100,000 adults, with approximately 160,000 hospital admissions annually. US treatment and prevention of NVUGIB continues to be a major medical emergency, costing 550-900 million dollars every year. Failure in standard of care for NVUGIB results in mortality rates from 3-4% in the US. An improved hemostatic approach to NVUGIB will significantly reduce hemorrhage related morbidity and mortality with reduced cost of hospital care. The ideal device would be nontoxic; able to be stored for 2 years without refrigeration; be easily deployed; provide immediate hemostasis for difficult to control brisk & pulsatile bleeding; allow successful low accuracy/acuity placement in a bleeding obscured surgical field; not require significant follow-up or removal; and dissolve or be digested in the gastric cavity in under 7 days. This proposal addresses finalization in development of such a device.  To address serious NVUGIB, Tricol Biomedical & Oregon Health & Science University propose to finalize development of a foldable, highly efficacious, chitosan gastrointestinal hemostatic dressing (CGHD) with wire delivery (WD) via a standard endoscope working channel. The primary objective of this research proposal is to complete development of a novel efficacious CGHD+DW and its management of challenging acute GI bleeding in the gastric environment that can be left in place to be fully digested or dissolved in less than 168 hours. The final CGHD+WD device will be validated in a 7-day study of a large animal model of brisk, pulsatile UGIB to support an investigational device exemption (IDE) for a Phase I clinical study. The central hypothesis of this Phase II proposal is that the finalized CGHD+DW with delivery through the standard endoscope working channel will provide effective, immediate and sustained hemostasis for brisk NVUGIB."
"9450451","Age-associated changes in immune function in old age are a known risk factor for tuberculosis (TB) however,  the contribution of the heightened systemic inflammatory state (inflammaging) often observed in elderly  individuals has not been previously considered. In Aim 1 we hypothesize that inflammation in the periphery will  serve as a predictive biomarker of pulmonary inflammation and susceptibility to M.tb infection in old age. We  will test this hypothesis by studying the function of circulating monocytes and soluble mediators from adult and  elderly donors and compare those signatures to data obtained in Projects 1 and 2 where M.tb interactions with  alveolar macrophages and alveolar lining fluid are studied in the same subjects. Our goal is to identify  predictive cellular and/or molecular patterns in the periphery in old age that will correlate with an increased  susceptibility to M.tb infection in the lung in old age. These comparative analyses of peripheral and pulmonary  immune responses extend our studies from observational to mechanistic and allow us to identify peripheral  predictive biomarkers of M.tb susceptibility that may have clinical application. We also hypothesize that M.tb  infection further fuels the systemic inflammaging state in old age and predisposes elderly individuals to develop  symptoms of TB that are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We will test this by investigating  the inflammatory phenotype and function of peripheral blood monocytes and inflammatory and immuno-  regulatory cytokines from adult and elderly subjects with latent or active TB. While inflammaging has been  established as a critical factor of health-span in the elderly, adaptive immune function is essential for the  control of many infectious diseases, including TB. It is unknown whether T cells can maintain their effector  function throughout a long-term latent M.tb infection. We hypothesize that individuals with latent M.tb infection  accumulate exhausted antigen specific T cells that no longer respond optimally to M.tb infection. We will  determine the phenotype and function of M.tb specific T cells in adult and elderly subjects with latent M.tb  infection and active TB, which will synergize with studies of M.tb infected mice performed in Project 3. The  ability to generate a robust recall response will be determined in vitro in response to M.tb antigens and in vivo  using an antigen challenge model where infiltrating lymphocytes are isolated from human TST induration  biopsies. This will be the first study to determine M.tb specific adaptive immune function in elderly individuals  with latent M.tb infection. Given the paucity of information regarding immune function in elderly TB patients as  well as elderly with latent M.tb infection, this project is highly significant. Project 4 provides an opportunity to  perform translational science within the continuum of this Program Project, and combines the proven  collaborative expertise of a clinical scientist (Wang) and basic researcher (Turner)."
"9498575","PROJECT SUMMARY Although an understanding of the biological mechanisms causing scleroderma (SSc) remains incomplete, emerging data underscore important connections linking cancer, autoimmunity and SSc. It is an important priority to identify SSc subgroups at high risk of cancer at SSc onset, as this may inform therapeutic approaches and provide insights into SSc pathogenesis. Our recent studies show that autoantibodies are useful to define biologically relevant subgroups. Among SSc patients with cancer, those with anti-RNA polymerase III (POLR3) antibodies are more likely to have cancer close to SSc onset (3, 4). However, >25% of patients with a short cancer-SSc interval currently have undefined autoantibodies. We have created an innovative autoantibody discovery pipeline, and demonstrate that multiple, additional autoantibodies (known and novel) are associated with coincident cancer at SSc onset. We also describe a novel antibody specificity that is enriched in anti-POLR3-positive patients who do not get cancer, suggesting that some immune responses might be protective against cancer. Lastly, we demonstrate that autoantibody subsets can aid in defining the magnitude and timing of cancer risk in SSc, and in predicting the types of tumors observed. The proposed studies will use a large population of SSc patients from two well-characterized SSc cohorts to define and validate autoantibodies associated with increased or decreased cancer risk, and to assess their utility, together with distinct phenotypic features, in quantifying cancer risk at SSc onset. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: Aim 1 will use an innovative antibody discovery pipeline and a rich cohort of SSc patients with cancer to identify known and novel autoantibody markers of a short cancer-SSc interval in patients lacking the 3 major SSc antibody specificities. The studies will also use the defined autoantibodies to search for evidence of somatic mutations of relevant autoantigens in matched cancers. Since ~80% of patients with POLR3 antibodies do not have cancer, and our preliminary data shows novel antibodies in this group, we will also identify autoantibodies associated with protection against cancer. These may be important markers of low cancer risk. Aim 2 will define time-dependent overall and site-specific cancer risk in patients with SSc relative to the general population, based on autoantibody and phenotypic subsets, to develop an evidence-based approach to cancer screening in patients with new onset SSc. Findings will be validated in a second large SSc cohort. This work will allow the development of a clinically relevant approach to cancer detection at SSc onset and establish a framework of more homogeneous serologic subgroups in whom the mechanistic relationships between cancer and autoimmunity can be interrogated. This approach is also relevant to other autoimmune rheumatic diseases (e.g. inflammatory myopathies) in which cancer and rheumatic disease onset are temporally linked."
"9474662","Distressed neighborhood environments, posttraumatic stress, and compromised sleep are inter-related problems that have all been implicated in the health disparities affecting urban minorities. In our recent work we found significant relationships between self-reported and census-derived indices of neighborhood disorder, and self-reported, habitual wake after sleep onset (WASO), with diminished nocturnal blood pressure (BP) dipping, which is a well-established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and is over-represented among African Americans. In addition to reduction of BP there is normally a shift toward parasympathetic dominance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) during sleep and evidence suggests that such shifts are important for healthy cardiovascular homeostasis. Are preliminary findings indicate that this shift can be compromised with PTSD and nocturnal vigilance in stressful neighborhood environments. The goal for the proposed study is to further establish and extend a model where trauma exposure and threatening environments elicit nocturnal vigilance and sleep-related fears that compromise the healthy reduction of SNS and rise in PNS activity during sleep which in turn stimulates secretion of atherogenic humoral factors, arterial stiffening, and cardiovascular disease risk. We will examine the roles of pre-sleep cognition using a questionnaire and real time assessment, and modifiable strategies for coping with sleep disruptive cognitions. We will then evaluate the impact of providing personalized feedback and recommendations based on study observations on how participants cope with potentially sleep disruptive cognitions and sleep efficiency. We will also determine whether healthier sleep-related behaviors (however achieved) will influence changes in ANS balance during sleep and cardiovascular risk biomarkers. Thus study findings will confirm and reveal biomarkers of cardiovascular pathogenesis related to stress and sleep disruption that precede diagnosable illness, identify targets for preventive interventions, and provide evaluation of a brief intervention that can be scaled up or built upon as study findings indicate."
"9414979","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although current research indicates an important role for sleep disturbance in the pathophysiology of PTSD, our understanding of PTSD-related sleep physiology is based primarily on studies of male subjects (8, 9, 15). This is highly concerning: evidence of gender differences in neurobiology and behavior suggests that research on sleep in males with PTSD may not pertain to females (12, 16-18). Dr. Richards proposes to examine sexual dimorphism in PTSD by examining sex differences in the role of REM sleep on a fundamental component of the disorder: negative emotional memory. Strong evidence indicates that REM sleep plays an essential part in consolidating memory for negative emotional stimuli (6, 11, 20-22). Research also indicates that women have better recall of negative emotional material than men (12-14). Surprisingly, such research has not been conducted in PTSD subjects. Dr. Richards recently published findings showing increased REM sleep in women with PTSD which has potential relevance for explaining sexual dimorphism in memory mechanisms in PTSD and increased PTSD risk in women. Dr. Richards' long-term objective is to gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of PTSD in both men and women. Her current objective is to examine the contribution of REM sleep to PTSD disease mechanisms in male and female subjects. She expects that insights gained from her research will ultimately contribute to the development of targeted treatments for PTSD symptoms in both men and women. She will benefit from exceptional training resources at UCSF, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, Stanford University and the San Francisco VA Medical Center and an outstanding team of mentors within the VA to develop her expertise in a unique area of inquiry: the measurement of sex differences in PTSD-related sleep physiology and their relationship to negative emotional memory. Her research will build on solid clinical experience with male and female veterans, on the research training and experience she acquired during public health and psychiatry residency training, and on her PTSD and sleep research as a VA staff psychiatrist under the mentorship of Dr. Thomas Neylan. The Stress and Health Research Program, directed by her primary mentor Dr. Neylan, and her co-mentor Dr. Daniel Mathalon, will ensure the adequacy of staff and equipment resources to accomplish the proposed objectives. The San Francisco VA Medical Center will provide the necessary sleep laboratory space. The research study will assess the relationship of sex and REM sleep on negative emotional memory in subjects with PTSD and age- and sex-matched trauma-exposed PTSD-negative controls. Twenty (20) male and 20 female veterans with PTSD and 20 male and 20 female controls between the ages of 18 and 40 will be enrolled. All participants will participate in a sleep laboratory admission involving an adaptation night and a night of undisturbed sleep. A subsample of forty participants (10 in each group) will participate in a second admission involving a REM-deprivation condition, in a counter-balanced cross-over design. The International Affective Picture System (IAPS) will be used to assess recall of negative emotional images in the undisturbed sleep and REM-deprived sleep conditions (23). Subjective arousal responses and the late positive component (LPC) of event-related potentials (ERPs) will also be used to study emotional arousal reactions to IAPS images and to compare the impact of arousal on memory across groups. Sleep of female subjects will be studied in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Her primary hypotheses examine the relationship of sex and REM sleep with consolidation of negative emotional memory in male and female PTSD and control subjects. Her secondary hypotheses examine sex differences in negative emotional memory following REM-deprivation sleep in PTSD and control subjects."
"9486895","Co-occurrence of seizures with Alzheimer's disease dramatically alters prognosis, and speeds cognitive de- cline. Even mild seizures that may go undetected by caregivers can increase Alzheimer's disease pathogene- sis and also independently lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. Subclinical (non-scorbutic) vitamin C (ascorbate) deficiency is widespread in the USA, particularly among the elderly, and veteran popula- tions where smoking and oxidative stress-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes are common. A critical, but understudied, mechanism of neuronal protection during excitatory signaling is the glutamate up- take-ascorbate release exchange in astrocytes. As glutamate is taken up into perisynaptic astrocytes via GLT- 1, ascorbate is released into the extracellular fluid providing acute protection against oxidative damage. If GLT- 1 transporter function is compromised by oxidative damage, or if insufficient ascorbate is available for release, then this protection is diminished and the neurotoxic effects of prolonged glutamate exposure are magnified. Recent data support the role of ascorbate treatments in mitigating the effects of seizures, but previous re- search has been critically limited by the use of rodent models that synthesize ascorbate and thus cannot be- come deficient. Decreased brain ascorbate, at levels relevant to human deficiency, is achieved in mice by ge- netic modification of the ability to synthesize ascorbate in liver (Gulo-/-) combined with differential ascorbate supplementation. These mice can also be crossed with the APP/PSEN1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease to model dietary insufficiency in combination with a disease in which co-occurrence of seizures is common. Specific Aim 1) Demonstrate the role of ascorbate in supporting glutamate clearance by cultured astrocytes. Using cultured astrocytes from both mice and humans we will investigate how conditions that alter the oxida- tive balance of the culture media (e.g. ascorbate and ?-amyloid) determine the properties of GLT-1 in gluta- mate uptake. We will also test how altered glutamate clearance under these situations impacts neuronal sur- vival using co-culture techniques and measuring survival and dendritic branching of primary cultured neurons following exposure to glutamate. These experiments will provide direct support for the importance of the gluta- mate-ascorbate exchange mechanism in supporting neuronal health and protecting against glutamate toxicity. Specific Aim 2) Determine relationship between low brain ascorbate conditions and susceptibility to spontane- ous and pharmacologically-induced seizures. We will record neuronal hyper excitability and measure seizure events through electroencephalography (EEG) under baseline conditions and following seizure induction using kainic acid. Such studies have not previously been conducted in low ascorbate conditions owing to lack of widespread access to appropriate models. We will use an implantable telemetry (wireless) system that allows long-term measuring of EEG in animals within their home cages. This is a significant advance on more tradi- tional `tethered' EEG systems. We will also determine the extent to which repeated exposures to glutamatergic agonists, even without a clear behavioral (seizure) correlate, can negatively impact both cognitive ability, and ?-amyloid production in the APP/PSEN1 mice to explore the functional outcome of seizures in an Alzheimer's disease model in addition to wild-type and Gulo-/- mice. Specific Aim 3) Establish the extent to which upregulation of GLT-1 improves glutamate clearance and de- creases detrimental effects of kainic acid treatments. GLT-1, and therefore glutamate clearance, represents a targetable strategy to reduce the extent of neural damage following hyperexcitability, or seizure events. We will investigate a compound, ceftriaxone, known to up-regulate GLT-1 expression, and assess its ability to de- crease seizure susceptibility and severity. Our long-term goal is to show that protecting glutamate uptake and avoiding ascorbate deficiency can minimize effects of seizure in specific populations, and provide a cheap pre- ventative strategy against cognitive decline."

"9543288","ABSTRACT: CORE D The overall objective of the Research Translation Core (Core D) is to oversee and execute the integration, dissemination and transfer of the scientific accomplishments emanating from the UC Davis Superfund Research Program (SRP) Center. The NIEHS SRP was created to address the need for innovative strategies and technologies to provide solutions to Superfund-related issues. As such, Core D will liaise between researchers within the UC Davis SRP and other National SRP Centers, as well as with the outside community, including other scientists, legislators and community partners to bridge the gap between the applied solutions needed for remediation of hazardous chemicals and the basic research performed in support of reducing the amount and toxicity of hazardous substances. Because progress toward solutions can be stunted without appropriate research translation tools and bi-directional partnerships to help shape and direct these tools, Core D will collaborate with all projects and cores to ensure that research products emanating from the UC Davis SRP are effectively transferred to and used by the appropriate end users. This will be achieved through communication within and external to the Center, building partnerships with government agencies, technology transfer, and the dissemination of relevant information to other end-users in a context applicable to the target audience. The expected outcome of the Core's activities is to facilitate the translation of UC Davis SRP technologies and research outcomes by involving relevant entities (e.g., intellectual property management, regulatory agencies, and partners) and assuring timely use of research products, which will ultimately help with the overall goal of NIEHS to protect human health from hazardous chemicals. This process starts with discovery, involves policy and ends with benefits to human populations and their environment. To achieve these overarching goals, the specific aims of the Research Translation Core are to I) translate research products to improve public and environmental health; II) communicate information about research products to relevant audiences and end-users within UC Davis, other SRP Centers, local, state and federal government, industry and the general public; and III) expand policy and community partnerships with local, state and federal government and regulatory agencies charged with protecting human health. To achieve these goals, the Research Translation Core will assure consistent communication with all projects and cores, build an advisory committee to help with all aspects of research translation, utilize several forms of media to translate UCD SRC research to appropriate end users, and host meetings to facilitate bi-directional communication and transdisciplinary research with external partners."
"9589980","Pulmonary fibrosis has emerged as the leading cause of death in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)/scleroderma, yet currently available therapies are only marginally effective. While recent work from several groups of investigators suggests a key role for lung macrophages in the development of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with SSc, this remains an area of controversy as the specific population(s) of lung macrophages that drive fibrosis and the molecular mechanisms by which they do so remain largely unknown. In advance of this proposal, we have developed novel tools to elucidate macrophage heterogeneity in the mouse and human lung including lineage tagging, flow cytometry and transcriptional profiling in order to examine the differential role of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, as compared to the monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages recruited to the lung, in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Using unbiased transcriptional analysis (RNAseq) of flow-sorted macrophage populations over the course of the development of experimental fibrosis, we identified genetic signatures of monocyte to alveolar macrophage differentiation and fibrosis. Moreover, we have developed a murine model, which lacks the pathogenic monocyte-derived macrophage and is thus unable to develop lung fibrosis. Specifically, mice with macrophage-specific deletion of caspase-8, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease originally identified as a key initiator of the apoptotic death receptor pathway and suppressor of necroptosis (CreLysMCasp8fl/fl or CreCD11cCasp8fl/fl), showed significantly attenuated fibrosis and an inability for recruited monocytes to differentiate into pro-fibrotic monocyte-derived Siglec Flow macrophages following intratracheal treatment with either bleomycin or an adenovirus encoding an active form of TGF-? as compared to Casp8fl/fl, CreLysM or CreCD11c mice. Thus, this model is an ideal to tool to understand the differentiation of monocytes into pro-fibrotic alveolar macrophages in response to lung injury. These model systems will allow us to apply the transcriptional data to the study of monocytes from patients with SSc differentiated into alveolar macrophages in the lungs of humanized mice and alveolar macrophages obtained from patients with SSc at the time of lung transplantation. Our studies will test the hypothesis that monocyte differentiation into pro-fibrotic Siglec Flow alveolar macrophages is essential for the development of lung fibrosis in both mice and humans in three interrelated specific aims."
"9457301","Summary: Project 3 DeGrado An expanding body of evidence argues that besides PrP, A, tau and synuclein can become prions and cause neurodegeneration. We seek to understand the assembly of prion precursors into oligomers and fibers, and to correlate the formation of specific conformational forms with toxicity and transmissibility. The small size of A makes it an attractive molecule to study with respect to conversion into prions that are presumably oligomers. We propose to determine the steps required for A to acquire a self-propagating conformation that templates the assembly of additional monomers into oligomers and possibly fibers. The molecular structures of the key intermediates in this process are poorly understood, and it is not known whether the transmissible particle has the parallel cross-beta structure seen in fibers. While it is generally accepted that A oligomers rather than fibers represent the toxic species, the relationship between toxicity and the size, conformation, and dynamics of the oligomers is unknown. We will develop new chemical tools to probe and dissect the steps of aggregation and amyloid formation. We will develop novel chemical strategies to rapidly trigger A association and follow the evolution of its conformation over time. We also will design peptide mimetics and foldamers that enhance or inhibit assembly by stabilizing specific intermediates, allowing one to obtain better defined populations for building correlations between structure, transmissibility and toxicity. Finally, we will develop crosslinking strategies that can be used to obtain a footprint of the conformational ensemble of synthetic versus natural A, PrP, and tau at various levels of assembly."
"9543663","Summer vacation represents an important time away from the school setting for a majority of children attending public school in the US. This break is characterized by large amounts of free time and involvement in a wide variety of formal and informal activities, time spent with friends and family, and travel. Yet for many children, particularly those from low-income households, summer vacation represents a ?window of vulnerability? in which dramatic declines in both health and academics occur. During the summer months (typically 3 months) children gain a larger amount of body weight compared to the amount of weight gained over the school year, and weight gain during summer reverses weight losses achieved during school. For academics, it is well established that children from low-income households experience greater declines in reading and math during the summer than their middle-to-upper income peers. Numerous programs that address these issues currently exist (e.g., summer school, summer weight loss or fitness programs). However, these programs are designed and delivered at the expense of the promotion or prevention of the other ? academic focus without health or health focus without academics. Our long-term goal is to develop summer programming for widespread dissemination that addresses both lifestyle behaviors (i.e., physical activity and nutrition) and academic performance. The objective of the proposed study is to establish the efficacy of an innovative ?Healthy Summer Learners? (HSL) program for low-income, minority children. The rationale for the proposed research is that no summer programs incorporate curriculum that addresses both unhealthy weight gains and academic achievement simultaneously. This application seeks to fill this void by testing a prototype learning and health- oriented summer program focused on promoting physical activity and nutrition, along with content that provides quality learning experiences to develop reading and math skills. To accomplish this objective, we will evaluate over 2 summers the effectiveness of a 10-week Healthy Summer Learners program delivered within a Boys & Girls Club summer camp using a randomized design in a sample of rising 4th graders. The aims of the study are Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of Healthy Summer Learners on children?s weight gain and academic performance from beginning (end of Spring school year) to the end of summer (beginning of Fall school year), and Aim 2: Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Healthy Summer Learners to children, parents, and program staff. This work is significant and represents an important step towards addressing important public health goals ? obesity and learning ? through a comprehensive program delivered during a timeframe ? summer vacation ? in which substantial and long-lasting negative effects occur. This application is innovative because of the dual approach of targeting both health and learning in a single, comprehensive program."

"9551519","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Problems noted: Functional Limitation (described as muscle weakness, body pain and difficulty in day-to-day activities), sarcopenia with or without accompanying weight loss, and cachexia under metastatic setting, are observed in 39%, 26%, and 25% of breast cancer patients, respectively. Functional limitation, observed even before cancer diagnosis, is the major reason for increased non-cancer related deaths in these patients. Thus, functional limitation is mechanistically concomitant to the paracrine effects of cancer. Sarcopenia impacts not only the functional ability but is also linked to increased toxicity from chemotherapy. While cachexia has received considerable attention because of its phenotypic manifestation, Functional Limitation and sarcopenia have not been studied extensively. Therefore, new model systems to understand the Functional Limitation and sarcopenia in breast cancer and therapeutic strategies are necessary.  Preliminary results to resolve the problem: We entered into this field through a serendipitous observation; circulating levels of cardiac and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNA miR-486 were lower in breast cancer patients with metastasis compared to healthy individuals and within experimental models of breast cancer. In animal models, lower circulating miR-486 levels correlated with reduced miR-486 expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle, two primary organs in which it is functionally involved. Moreover, proteins in the myogenesis (MyoD), myotube survival (DOCK3/PTEN/AKT) and cardiomyocyte survival (PI3K/PTEN/pAKT and pp38) networks, that are regulated by and/or regulate miR-486, were deregulated in cardiac and skeletal muscle of tumorbearing transgenic mice compared to controls. Overall, signaling defects in muscle of tumor-bearing animals resembled that of muscular dystrophy mutants (aberrant dystrophin isoforms, lower miR-486, elevated PTEN, and DOCK3). Tumor-derived or recombinant TNF? reduced miR-486 in myogenic and/or cardiomyoblast cell lines. NF-?B and/or p38 kinase, both major signaling molecules downstream of TNF?, are critical in relaying the paracrine effects of cancer, as a constitutively active p65 subunit of NF-?B reduced miR-486 in myogenic cell line. These results extend our previous observations on NF-?B activation in cancer progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance to include cancer-induced systemic functional effects.    Hypothesis: Cancer-induced cytokines such as TNF? can impair cardiomyocyte survival and myogenic differentiation via miR-486 deregulation, which leads to Functional Limitation, sarcopenia, cachexia or muscular dystrophy-like phenotype. Thus, circulating miR-486 levels serve as an early predictor of these systemic effects of cancer, which can be exploited not only for diagnostic purpose but also for therapy.     Three aims will test this hypothesis: 1) Determine that cancer disrupts the myogenesis network via miR-486 depletion to cause muscular dystrophy-like condition or sarcopenia; 2) Investigate if NF-?B is a critical signaling relay; and 3) Determine whether circulating miR-486 levels can serve as a putative early indicator of precachexia with accompanying loss of both muscle and fat.        Study impact: Although Functional Limitation in breast cancer patients at the time of diagnosis was first reported in 2004, to our knowledge, no mechanistic studies have been conducted since that time, nor have any therapies been developed. Similarly, sarcopenia, which increases chemotherapy-induced toxicity but is not always manifested phenotypically, is well known in breast cancer but therapies have not been developed. The results of this study will have a positive impact by creating new opportunities for rationally interfering with cancer-induced collateral damage to distant organs by repurposing drugs that are already being tested in clinic and prescreening approaches, thereby leading to the discovery of new mechanism-based therapeutic modalities to improve quality of life in cancer patients."
"9508139","Reciprocal regulation between the ECM and associated epithelial cells is integral to development, homeostasis and disease. Somites are segmental precursors of the vertebral column and musculature that form via a mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Somite morphogenesis is dependent upon a Fibronectin ECM, the Fibronectin receptor Integrin ?5?1, the cell adhesion protein Cadherin 2 and bidirectional signaling via the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA4 and its membrane bound ligand Ephrin-B2a. These genes/pathways mediate cell-ECM adhesion, cell-cell adhesion and contact mediated cell repulsion, and our hypothesis is that the physical organizing activity of the somite boundary emerges via specific spatiotemporal intertwining of differential cell adhesion and ECM constrained cell repulsion. In Aim 1, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence crosscorrelation spectroscopy (FCCS) will be used quantify protein diffusion and protein binding constants in vivo. These experiments will determine whether the segregation of these cell surface proteins occurs via diffusion and capture or active mobilization. Additionally, the roles of integrin ?5, cadherin 2 and ephrin-b2a in driving these changes in subcellular localization will be elucidated by performing FCCS in live mutant embryos. In Aim 2, a systems analysis of cell motion will be used to quantify tissue biomechanics during somite morphogenesis in wild-type and mutant embryos. In Aim 3, we quantify the relative levels of Integrin activation via cytoplasmic signals versus via positive feedback through the ECM. Positive and negative feedback between biological mechanisms creates network effects that are hard to predict a priori and difficult to fully explore experimentally. in silico modeling will be used to systematically examine the relationships between cell adhesion, cell-ECM adhesion and cell contact mediated repulsion in somite morphogenesis in order to help interpret and prioritize more resource intensive wet-lab experiments."
"9447275","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Controlling inflammation and cellular damage is the key to preventing and treating multiple organ failure (MOF) following trauma. However, many of the mechanisms that regulate inflammation and cell death in specific organs remain unknown. This means that despite advances in supportive measures for patients with MOF, there have been few advances in MOF treatments, or in our ability to adequately prevent the onset of MOF. Our overarching goal is to ultimately develop new therapeutics for trauma patients based on regulating the inflammatory response and its effects on cellular death and survival pathways following trauma and hemorrhagic shock with resuscitation (HS/R). In this proposal we will continue to investigate novel molecular pathways following HS/R that lead to activation of caspase-11 in end-organs, particularly liver. We will also determine how activation of inflammatory caspases regulates cell death and inflammation, which in turn determines organ cell survival after HS/R. Knowing how these cell-signaling pathways function and interact may guide us toward future therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of MOF after trauma.  Inflammatory caspases include caspases-1, 11 (mice), 4/5 (human), and are associated with inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) and release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1?, IL-18). Caspase-11 was recently identified as the intracellular receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and forms what has been termed the non-canonical inflammasome. LPS-mediated caspase-11 activation in macrophages results in cleavage of gasdermin D (GsdmD) and subsequent release of IL-1?, induction of pyroptosis, and initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activation. Caspase-11 can also be activated by endogenous oxidized phospholipid (oxPAPC) in LPS-primed dendritic cells, although this interaction does not result in pyroptosis. Our exciting new data show that caspase-11 is activated during HS/R, a non-infectious/sterile injury model, suggesting a novel mechanism of activation of caspase-11 by endogenous damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) without a requirement for LPS. We show that once again mitochondria are integral in activation of inflammatory responses after HS/R, and cardiolipin externalization on damaged and stressed mitochondria can activate caspase-11. Surprisingly activation of caspase-11 in HC after HS/R does not lead to pyroptosis, but is vital for active release of HC HMGB1 in exosomes, and caspase-11 activation is detrimental in HS/R. Our preliminary findings lead us to our main hypothesis that DAMP-induced caspase-11 activation has cell specific functions during HS/R, and is an important regulator of cell death and organ damage. We expect to confirm novel, mitochondrial DAMP-mediated pathways of activation of caspase-11, and novel functions of caspase-11 in liver that may make it an attractive therapeutic target during trauma/HS."
"9455675","Project Summary/Abstract The macular pigment carotenoids, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lutein?s metabolite meso-zeaxanthin are uniquely concentrated in the primate foveal region to form the yellow pigment of the macula lutea where they can enhance visual function and protect against the light-induced oxidative damage that has been associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other disorders of the retina. Diets and supplements enriched in lutein and zeaxanthin are among the most widely prescribed interventions for patients concerned about future visual loss from AMD, and these xanthophyll carotenoids have become standard-of-care for individuals with large drusen or advanced AMD in one eye based on AREDS2 results; however, it is common in the United States for patients and clinicians to integrate nutritional interventions into clinical practice beyond indications established in large, randomized clinical trials such as AREDS2, and carotenoids are no exception. For example, lutein has recently been incorporated into prenatal supplements and infant formulas without any clinical trials at all, based only on the hope that it might promote health and development of the child?s visual system, and nondietary carotenoids such as meso-zeaxanthin are now being promoted as ?next generation AREDS supplements?, again without adequate clinical or basic science studies. The Bernstein laboratory is dedicated to provide mechanistic insights into the biochemistry, physiology, and pharmacology of the macular carotenoids to optimize rational, safe interventions against blinding diseases throughout the lifespan. The key organizing concept that drives the laboratory?s research is that the specific deposition and protective functions of the three macular carotenoids in the human foveal region are mediated by complex, regulated interplay of binding proteins, transporters, and metabolic enzymes. The research group examines this premise using an integrated approach that includes biochemical studies on the enzymology and protein biochemistry of carotenoid transport and metabolism, animal models for carotenoid function in the eye in health and disease using transgenic ?macular pigment mice? genetically engineered to have enhanced carotenoid uptake into the retina relative to wild-type mice, and advanced imaging techniques with particular emphasis on resonance Raman imaging to localize the macular carotenoids at unprecedented spectral and spatial resolution. The results of these studies will advance mechanistic knowledge of their physiological functions at a molecular level, which will enable basic studies that account for their roles in retinal neuroprotection, as well as clinical studies that will lead to rational, scientifically supported decisions about treatments to prevent visual loss throughout a person?s lifetime."
"9453634","ABSTRACT APOE4 is the greatest genetic risk for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD), increasing risk up to 12-fold compared to APOE3. Further, APOE4 carriers often respond differently, sometimes negatively, in clinical trials. Thus, a major challenge facing modern science is developing therapeutic strategies for APOE4 carriers, and AD in general. The focus of this proposal is to target mechanistic processes that are AD-centric and further exacerbated by APOE4. Neurovascular (NV) dysfunction, including at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), is emerging as a critical component of AD progression. Although APOE modulates AD risk through multifactorial mechanisms, a role for APOE in NV dysfunction is increasingly evident. Indeed, our preliminary data in novel EFAD transgenic mice (express human APOE and 5xFamilial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations) demonstrates that APOE4 and FAD induce cognitive dysfunction and NV leakiness in female mice by 8 months of age, significant as APOE4-induced AD risk is greater in females. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that: APOE4 imparts a detrimental NV phenotype which can be overcome using targeted therapeutics. Accumulating evidence supports that repurposing antihypertensive therapeutics, particularly angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), is a promising treatment for AD through modulating the NV. In prospective studies ARBs are associated with a lower incidence and progression of AD, and ARBs have improved AD-like pathology in a limited number of AD-relevant models. However, clinically relevant questions for ARBs should be addressed in preclinical studies before repurposing for AD. One major issue is that no studies have tested ARBs in AD models that express human APOE. A second issue centers on whether beneficial effects of ARBs are: 1) systemic blood pressure-dependent, 2) systemic blood pressure-independent by acting directly on brain endothelial cells (BECs) at the BBB, 3) mediated via targets in the CNS, or combinational. Given that ARBs may exert functional effects on angiotensin receptors outside of vascular targets and blood pressure, specifically within the brain, it is important to consider brain penetration in preclinical studies. Indeed, although ARBs are considered poorly brain penetrant there is evidence of brain activity and therapeutically active brain bioavailability. In general, addressing the frequently overlooked issue of brain bioavailability and effects on efficacy is critical, highlighted by the recent failure of tarenflurbil and semagacestat in AD clinical trials, which show zero brain penetration. Proceeding to clinical trials without this information, particularly for drug repurposing, can result in failure and effectively end interest in a promising target. We hypothesize that repurposing or redesigning ARBs is an attractive therapy for AD, and may be particularly efficacious for APOE4 carriers. In Aim 1, the oral pharmacokinetics of ARBs will be measured assessed in wild type mice and in E4FAD mice at efficacious doses. In Aim 2, the efficacy and pharmacodynamics activity of ARBs will be assessed using treatment and prevention paradigms in EFAD mice."
"9462743","NEUROPATHOLOGY CORE (CORE D) - PROJECT SUMMARY The Neuropathology Core of the Wisconsin ADRC (ADRC) will support cutting edge cellular and molecular neuroscience technologies to the ADRC patient population and their properly banked tissue in the service of enhancing research regarding early detection, treatment outcome, and basic mechanisms of AD. The core will facilitate clinical-pathologic and translational research on normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD and other dementias by providing to Wisconsin ADRC and outside investigators a comprehensive resource of biospecimens, biomarker data, clinical data, and state-of-the-art diagnoses for MCI and AD, vascular, Lewy body, TDP-43, and mixed pathologies, from subjects in the Clinical Core and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). The Neuropathology Core will generate and assemble critical diagnostic information by combining clinical data (Core B), innovative neuroimaging (Core G) and biomarker assays collected during life with brain autopsy and morphologic, immunohistochemical, genetic, cell and molecular post-mortem analyses. The Neuropathology Core will also provide access to cutting edge tools (including genomics and proteomics) to enhance AD research on banked, frozen tissue. The Core will accomplish these goals by 1) collecting and archiving ante-mortem CSF, blood and DNA and post-mortem frozen and fixed tissue blocks from multiple brain regions on deceased individuals who are enrolled in the Wisconsin ADRC as well as normal elderly controls; 2) providing state-of-the-art postmortem diagnoses on Clinical Core subjects, collect NACC neuropathology data and make the results available to the family, relevant clinicians, qualified researchers, & NACC; 3) distributing ante-mortem and post-mortem biospecimens (brain, CSF, blood products, and DNA) and neuropathologic, genetic, biomarker and other data to suit the requirements of qualified research projects, both within UW-Madison and for national and international multi-center collaborations; 4) performing genetic and biomarker analyses in support of ADRC and outside investigators; and 5) providing high quality, cost effective, cell and molecular neuroscience equipment, technology, assays, expertise, and training to Wisconsin ADRC investigators. A flow of services is therefore envisaged whereby Wisconsin ADRC investigators and collaborators are able to obtain unambiguous post-mortem diagnosis, neuropathological data and tissues from the Neuropathology Core together with comprehensive biomarker data (Biomarker Services) and neuroimaging data (Core G). Moreover, advanced molecular and cellular analyses can be performed on tissues by the Biomarker, and Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience Services."
"9462727","PROJECT TWO SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Brain amyloidosis is a constant feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD); almost all patients with AD have high uptake of PET amyloid-binding radioligands such as PiB when scanned during life and extensive amyloid deposits at death. Cognitively normal individuals who have amyloid positive PET scans however present an unresolved conundrum: are they on the road to AD and will develop dementia given enough time, or do their brains have specific features that render them less vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of A?. This project will directly address this question by defining the neuropathological phenotype of individuals who are amyloid imaging positive and cognitively normal and document differences with those who are amyloid imaging positive and cognitively impaired. Further, by conducting detailed analyses of the pathological changes that occur during the earliest point in disease, we will be able to identify the evolution of changes that lead to dementia symptoms and identify useful surrogate markers to guide early diagnosis such as novel in vivo neuroimaging techniques. We will test these major hypotheses: 1) neuronal loss in the entorhinal cortex builds gradually during the preclinical phase of AD before an individual becomes symptomatic; 2) soluble oligomeric A? levels will be greater in the impaired cases: 3) non-amyloid changes, such as tau lesions, will correlate closely with neuronal loss in amyloid imaging positive cases and 4) synaptic loss and glia activation will correlate with clinical symptoms and mark the transition to symptomatic stages; these changes will be less prominent in the resilient cases. In order to accomplish these goals, we have established working collaborations with four other ADCs (Mayo, University of Pittsburgh, Washington University and Columbia) to share clinical and neuroimaging data as well as brain tissue from three groups of subjects: Amyloid imaging positive and cognitively normal, amyloid imaging positive and cognitively impaired, and amyloid imaging negative and cognitively normal. By identifying neurobiologic factors that occur during the years after amyloid begins to accumulate but before symptoms manifest, we will set the stage for guiding the next generation of neuroimaging and other diagnostic tests as well as define rational targets for future effective therapeutic interventions."
"9453006","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K08 Career Development Award for Philip A. Verhoef, MD, PhD. Dr. Verhoef is an immunologist and an ICU physician in the adult and pediatric critical care units at the University of Chicago. He is building a career a a translational immunologist-intensivist, capable of bringing cutting edge immunology from the bench to the ICU bedside in order to understand the devastating disease of sepsis. This K08 award will provide Dr. Verhoef with the support necessary to achieve the following goals: 1) extend his experience in innate murine immunology to the use of mouse models of sepsis for understanding immunologic dysregulation underlying sepsis mortality; 2) develop expertise in the collection and immunologic analysis of samples from critically ill patients, and 3) utilize lare datasets to explore biologically relevant associations between complex diseases. To achieve these goals, Dr. Verhoef has assembled a mentoring team led by primary mentor, Dr. Anne Sperling, who is a pulmonary immunologist with experience in both mouse and human cellular immunology with, co-mentor Dr. Juliane Bubeck Wardenburg, who is an immunology-trained microbiologist and Section Chief of Pediatric Critical Care with expertise in host-pathogen interactions, and three advisors: Dr. Gokhan Mutlu, who is the Section Chief of Pulmonary/Critical Care and an expert in lung injury; Dr. Julian Solway, who is a pulmonologist and Dean of Translational Medicine with skills at assessing large datasets for identification of disease phenotypes; and Dr. Andrey Rzhetsky, a theoretical biologist and a leading expert in the development of novel bioinformatics approaches to complex biology and disease. The proposed research in this application will be conducted at the University of Chicago, one of the nation's leading private universities and home to renowned divisions of immunology, pulmonary medicine, bioinformatics, and microbiology, with state-of-the-art facilities to enable cutting-edge research. Sepsis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for more than 10% of all ICU admissions in the USA. One theory of sepsis pathophysiology describes the host's immune response as a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory signals that simultaneously serve to eliminate the pathogen and resolve tissue destruction caused by both the pathogen and the host's response. While the pro-inflammatory signals typically include type 1 or type 17 responses, the anti-inflammatory signal mediators remain less well understood. Recent evidence suggests that type 2 cytokines, classically associated with Th2 allergic responses, play a role. Dr. Verhoef's central hypothesis is that these type 2 immune responses counter type 17 immune responses during infection, acting to both prevent the development of sepsis and protect against sepsis-associated mortality. Dr. Verhoef's preliminary data indicates that mice with active type 2 inflammation are completely protected from lethal Staphylococcus aureus sepsis. Thus, in Aim 1, he will systematically examine the mechanisms of this novel type 2 immune response protection during sepsis, using murine immunology techniques. In addition, Dr. Verhoef has found that among patients with S. aureus bacteremia, those alive at 90 days had higher numbers of circulating Th2 cells early in their immune response compared with non-survivors, suggesting a protective role for type 2 immune responses. In Aim 2, Dr. Verhoef will use samples from these patients to explore the cellular mechanisms of protective type 2 and S. aureus- specific immune activation, and prospectively validate this approach in newly septic ICU patients. Finally, using large dataset analysis, Dr. Verhoef has found that patients with sepsis are less likely to have comorbid type 2- mediated immune diseases like asthma and allergy, suggesting that these immune responses protect against the development of sepsis. In Aim 3, he will extend these analyses by looking at outcomes from sepsis in hospitalized patients, as a function of either type 2 immune response biasing or cause of infection. Thus, Dr. Verhoef is addressing the pathophysiology of sepsis using 3 divergent and complementary methods which capitalize on his training as a clinician and an immunologist, in the environment of a cutting-edge university. This research will form the basis for an R01 grant application focused on integrating epidemiologic predictors of disease and individual cellular immune phenotypes to create a unique, patient-specific immune fingerprint that can be used to develop a precision-medicine approach to diagnosis and treatment of sepsis in the ICU."

"9498341","SUMMARY The overarching goal of this project is to understand how the DNA Damage Response (DDR) activates apoptotic cell death. The DDR is a kinase driven signaling pathway that coordinates multiple cellular functions, including: surveillance for DNA damage, recruitment of DNA repair enzymes, and activation of cell cycle checkpoint arrest. Collectively, these events promote survival following genotoxic stress. Alternatively, in some cases the DDR activates apoptosis. Although much is known about these each of these functions, it still remains unclear why activation of the DDR leads to survival in some cases and death in others. The current model suggests that p53 controls the decision to arrest and repair, or alternatively, to activate cell death. This model does not explain the common observation that cancer cells ? which often lack p53 ? can robustly activate apoptosis when exposed to DNA damage. Thus, other unidentified mechanisms must also exist to facilitate DDR-induced cell death. Our strategy for identifying mechanisms by which the DDR activates apoptosis was to perform functional genetic screens in cells that lack p53 but retain high levels of DNA damage sensitivity. Our screen has identified that activation of caspase-1 and caspase-1 associated inflammatory cytokine signaling is required for robust DNA damage induced cell death. This was unexpected because unlike other members of the caspase family, caspase-1 is not thought to contribute to apoptotic cell death. In this proposal, we will use live cell microscopy experiments to determine the fate of cells that have activated caspase-1. Additionally, we will use biochemical and genetic experiments to determine mechanisms by which caspase-1 is activated by DNA damage. Finally, we will use high-throughput targeted proteomic and genomic analyses, together with data driven statistical modeling, to determine mechanisms by which caspase- 1 signaling is integrated with the DDR to promote apoptotic cell death. A major outcome from this study will be an understanding of how intra-cellular and inter-cellular crosstalk between inflammatory and DDR signaling helps to facilitate activation of apoptosis. This information may help to understand the variable sensitivity to DNA damage that is observed across tissues and across people, and may ultimately improve our ability to reliably control life-death decisions following DNA damage."

"9460491","Project Description Cochlear implants are highly successful neural prostheses that enhance or restore hearing to the severely hearing impaired. However, performance varies considerably among cochlear implant listeners, particularly in noisy environments and for spectrally complex stimuli like music. We have developed fast and reliable tools to assess patterns of perceptual responses that are fairly predictive of variability in performance outcomes. These new procedures, established in adults, will allow for the first systematic investigation of single-channel performance measures and their relation to listening performance in children with cochlear implants. The results will guide the refinement of listener-tailored programming methods, leading to improvements in listening abilities. Three aims are proposed: 1) to develop and assess listener-tailored cochlear implant programming, based on the focusing or deactivation of select channels, that will improve performance on complex listening tasks; 2) to assess the degree to which chronic listening experience enhances performance with listener-tailored strategies; and 3) to establish our first understanding of basic psychophysical measures in prelingually deaf and early implanted children to define the best route towards pediatric, listener-tailored programming approaches. The results of these studies are expected to advance our understanding of how cochlear implants should be programmed to best deliver spectrally challenging stimuli. Ultimately, the findings may lead to improved functional outcomes for both pediatric and adult cochlear implant listeners and provide insight into how the auditory system develops with altered input through a cochlear implant."
"9459829","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an effective HIV/AIDS vaccine remains a high international health priority as the most cost-effective means to stem the AIDS pandemic. At this point in time, there are very few general HIV/AIDS vaccine strategies that remain viable for clinical development as a prophylactic HAV/AIDS vaccine - that is, vaccine platforms that have shown promising efficacy in preclinical studies and not been proved ineffective in human clinical trials. Among these is the approach developed by our group in which persistent Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-derived vectors are used to elicit high-frequency, indefinitely persistent HIV/SIV- specific effector-memory T cell responses. In the preclinical rhesus macaque (RM) - SIV model, we have demonstrated that after mucosal SIV challenge >50% of monkeys vaccinated with strain 68-1 RhCMV/SIVgag, /SIVpol, /SIVenv, /SIVrevtatnef vectors show complete, durable protection and eventual clearance by virologic and immunologic criteria. Protection is likely determined by the ability of effector T cells to intercept a nascent HIV/SIV infection immediately upon acquisition (with no response delay due to requirement for anamnestic expansion and effector differentiation). If this assumption is correct one could speculate that a greater efficacy could be achieved if the earliest HIV/SIV immunogens could be targeted within hours after initial infection. Recently a novel set of 5' leader sequence-encoded HIV and SIV polypeptides was discovered, and these polypeptides are expressed very early in HIV/SIV-infected cells and were highly immunogenic. Therefore, the 5' leader polypeptides (5'-LP) are an extremely attractive vaccine target considering that every spliced and unspliced HIV/SIV mRNA contains the 5' leader sequence, and thus polypeptides encoded from this region will be ubiquitously expressed rapidly and early following infection. Thus, the major objective of the research proposed here will be to determine whether RhCMV vectors expressing SIV 5' leader polypeptides can protect rhesus macaques from mucosal challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, and if these vectors in combination with vectors expressing conventional SIV open reading frames, can enhance the overall protective efficacy of the RhCMV-vectored vaccine. These objectives will be accomplished by experimentally addressing the following Specific Aims: (i) To characterize the immunogenicity of strain 68-1 RhCMV/5'-LP vectors in rhesus macaques and to use this immunogenicity, in combination with biochemical analysis, to define the 5'-LP epitopes expressed by SIV-infected CD4+ T cells; (ii) To determine the efficacy of strain 68-1 RhCMV/5'-LP vector vaccination against limiting-dose, intra-rectal SIV challenge; and if Go/No-Go criteria are met, (iii) To determine the immunogenicity and efficacy of a combination vaccine containing both strain 68-1 RhCMV/5'- LP vectors and strain 68-1 RhCMV vectors expressing Gag, Rev/Nef/Tat, Pol, Env."
"9553465","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder in which selective loss of motor neurons leads to fatal paralysis. Military personnel are nearly twice as likely to develop ALS, regardless of the branch of service or the time period served, thus its impact on veteran health care is enormous. However, little is known about the pathogenesis of ALS, and there is no cure or effective treatment. Discovery of mutations in SOD1 has been the driving force in ALS research for the last two decades. More recently, two RNA binding proteins (RBP), TDP-43 and FUS, have been linked to sporadic and familial ALS, and underscore the role of abnormal RNA processing in the pathogenesis of this disease. How TDP-43 and FUS are regulated is unknown. We have found that Human antigen R (HuR) is required for proper TDP-43 and FUS expression. HuR is a major RBP with striking structural and functional similarities to TDP-43 and FUS. We have reported that cellular toxicity induced by mutant SOD1, including apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction, could be reversed by up-regulating HuR in a gene dose-dependent manner, suggesting a protective role of HuR in neurodegeneration. Our preliminary data suggest that HuR translocates to the cytoplasm in spinal cords of ALS patients, it specifically binds to TDP-43 3'UTR and promotes TDP-43 and FUS expression under normal and stressed conditions. HuR also regulates ubiquitination of cellular proteins, a key element in the proper functioning of the proteasome. We hypothesize that HuR positively regulates TDP-43 and FUS expression through posttranscriptional mechanisms. Disruption of this regulation leads to compromised cellular stress response and motor neuron toxicity. We will test this hypothesis by performing experiments with the following specific aims: 1. Define HuR as an upstream regulator of TDP-43 and FUS, and assess its downstream effect on TDP-43 splicing function, cellular stress response and motor neuron survival. 2. Determine the role of cis-regulatory elements in the 3'UTR of TDP-43 in its cross- and self- posttranscriptional regulation, and analyze protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions between HuR and TDP-43. 3. Determine the role of HuR in the translational regulation and protein degradation of TDP-43 and FUS."
"9646468","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dysregulation of the immune system underlies many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In concert with the human genome, the intestinal microbiota regulate development and function of the immune system, modulating the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. A considerable body of evidence based on preclinical and clinical research suggests that gut microbes play a critical role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a family of idiopathic intestinal disorders with increasing prevalence and limited treatment options. Concordance rates of 30-40% among monozygotic twins implicate gene-environment interactions. Genome wide association studies have implicated roughly 200 susceptibility loci that are significantly associated with IBD. Many variants encode for genes involved in microbial recognition and immunity, suggesting host-microbe interactions may regulate the balance between immune health and inflammatory disease. Polymorphisms in genes of the autophagy pathway (e.g., ATG16L1), and in pattern recognition receptors that are associated with autophagy (e.g., NOD2), represent some of the most significant effect sizes in IBD susceptibility. Further, considerable research has focused on investigating the function of Atg16L1 and NOD2 in mouse models and human cells, and identified a role for both gene products in sensing and killing pathogenic microbes. Current understanding therefore suggest that IBD may be caused by mutations that impair immunity to pathogenic bacteria, leading to chronic exposure to microbial products that activates uncontrolled inflammation. Herein, I present new findings that beneficial gut bacteria such a Bacteroides fragilis require Atg16L1 and NOD2 to promote anti-inflammatory responses in mouse and human cells, and mice deleted in these genes are not protected from colitis by B. fragilis. I propose a novel, non-redundant role for genes previously implicated in recognition and killing of pathogenic bacteria?namely, mutations in genetic pathways linked to IBD result in defective recognition of beneficial molecules from the microbiome. My hypothesis is that genetic defects in Atg16L1 may lead to IBD by not `sensing' and responding to the protective signals of beneficial gut bacteria. I will test my hypothesis in three Specific Aims, which include: 1) defining the cellular pathway(s) required for immune regulation by B. fragilis; 2) Determining Atg16L1 mechanism of action during regulatory T cell induction by B. fragilis; 3) Establishing whether NOD2 is required for mediating the beneficial effects of B. fragilis in mouse and human systems. In other words, the absence of sensing and responding to anti-inflammatory bacterial signals may be a risk factor for chronic intestinal inflammation. The training (K99) phase of this award will be mentored by Dr. Sarkis Mazmanian, and will facilitate the transition of my research program towards an independent investigator (R00)."
"9480731","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing. Winship is uniquely positioned to apply its scientific strengths, outstanding membership, robust infrastructure, strong institutional support, and comprehensive training programs to fulfill its mission of lessening the burden of cancer on the state of Georgia and beyond."
"9552681","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Helicobacter pylori and its sequelae of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer remain substantial health concerns for our Veterans. H. pylori infects half of the world's population, causes peptic ulcers in 10% and gastric cancer in 1-3% of those infected, and it is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. American Servicemen/women are exposed to H. pylori in regions where infection rates are very high and strains associated with high cancer risk are prevalent. For disease progression, chronic inflammation and epithelial events are necessary. We have identified mechanisms underlying inflammation and carcinogenesis. This includes induction of futile, dysregulated, innate and adaptive immune responses leading to inflammation; and molecular signatures of carcinogenesis. Antibiotics do not uniformly eradicate the infection, and do not reduce cancer risk if preneoplastic lesions have developed, thus there is a great need to establish strategies for prevention of disease progression. Risk for cancer remains a major issue in Veterans particularly those that are Hispanic, whose numbers are increasing. We have implicated the biogenic polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), derived from the rate-limiting enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), in gastric inflammation and carcinogenesis, and shown that DNA damage is due to induction of spermine oxidase (SMOX), which is downstream of ODC and generates H2O2. We have reported that H. pylori strains from Veterans induced SMOX expression and oxidative DNA damage in vitro and in tissues. Our goal is to find new strategies for intervention. Polyamine generation is downstream of the amino acid L-arginine (L-Arg). We have shown that cellular uptake of L-Arg is regulated by cationic amino acid transporter 2 (CAT2; solute carrier family 7, member 2, or SLC7A2), and is induced by H. pylori infection. We have key new evidence that SLC7A2 is a key player in gastric epithelial cells, and that it is upregulated in gastric cancer. We have recently implicated the cytoskeletal protein Talin-1 in the pathogenesis of infectious colitis, and now show that it may link L-Arg and H. pylori-induced immune dysregulation. Talin-1 is upregulated in macrophages with H. pylori infection, including in gastric cancer. We will further pursue targets for intervention in the L-Arg/polyamine pathway by investigating SMOX and oxidative stress derived from epithelial cells vs. macrophages, and by utilizing a novel inhibitor of SMOX. We hypothesize that arginine availability and metabolism, including polyamine synthesis and oxidation, are key events that lead to H. pylori-associated gastric inflammation, injury, DNA damage, and risk for carcinogenesis. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine the myeloid and epithelial components related to SLC7A2-mediated effects on gastric inflammation and damage. We will utilize H. pylori strains and tissues from Veterans and from subjects at high and low cancer risk, and study cell-specific responses: A) Induction and role of SLC7A2 in gastric epithelial cells, gastric organoids, and gastric tissues; B) Bone marrow chimeras using Slc7a2-/- mice. 2) To determine if Talin-1 is a key regulator of responses to H. pylori infection. We will assess Talin-1 expression and function in vitro and in vivo: A) Talin-1 expression and function in epithelial cells and macrophages, and effect of L-Arg availability; B) Role of Talin-1 n vivo, including studies in human tissues from Veterans, in mice with altered L-Arg availability and with myeloid-specific deletion of Tln1. 3) To determine effects of epithelial cells and immune cells in SMOX- mediated gastric inflammation and carcinogenesis. We will utilize mouse and gerbil models and assess: A) Effects of bone marrow chimeras using Smox-/- mice; B) Effect of a novel SMOX inhibitor on inflammation and carcinogenesis in mice and gerbils. These studies will have a major impact on our understanding of H. pylori immunopathogenesis and progression to gastric carcinogenesis, and will lead to new approaches for risk assessment and treatment."
"9481724","The overarching goal of the proposed TL1 training program for Conduits, the Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences, is to develop innovative educational experiences in clinical translational science thereby fostering recruitment, training, mentorship and retention of talented individuals from diverse backgrounds who are inspired to engage in team science to improve human health. The proposed program is specifically designed to directly address singular unmet needs, challenges and recommendations for strengthening the clinical investigator pipeline: 1) lack of diversity within the current workforce, with strong endorsement for significant investments in fostering the emergence of minority participation in translational science leadership; and 2) diminishing numbers of MD physician-scientists and summary recommendations for CTSA provisions of funding for medical students to earn a Master?s in Clinical Research. To address these specific challenges we propose two specific training opportunities under the TL1 umbrella: 1) the Sinai Team-based Translational Education Program: the URM Propeller (STTEP UP) Initiative for Science and Medicine, designed for URM post-baccalaureate (STEM fields: 4 students per year) and postdoctoral (residents and subspecialty fellows in particular: 4 students per year) trainees; and 2) the new entry (after completion of the first year of medical school) PORTAL (MD/MSCR) program (3 students/year), designed to attract medical students (in particular URM and financially disadvantaged students) who may not have previously been afforded the chance to consider this type of career opportunity. This training effort will leverage our partnership with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), and the scientific, clinical, and educational expertise of ISMMS and the MSHS. These efforts will also build upon previous CTSA-funded and inspired institutional investments in translational therapeutics, genomics, BIG Data analytics, personalized medicine, population specific health and clinical trials expertise, community engagement, team science and mentorship. To optimize and enrich this training effort we have woven into the fabric of our curricular efforts, the programmatic strengths and expertise of other components of this CTSA proposal and will capitalize upon previously established and ongoing collaborations with education leaders at other CTSA Hubs. Finally, to more effectively educate our trainees in translational science we will develop and implement novel game-based learning tools, in collaboration with the Games and Simulation Arts and Science Program at RPI. We propose to create and disseminate models of early pipeline programs designed to specifically address the needs of under-represented minority (URM) members of the translational research workforce. The educational programs described will foster critical thinking as well as the acquisition of methodological skills and principles of productive teamwork, to enable individuals with discipline-related knowledge to apply their expertise to develop translational science research programs that will accelerate discovery to improve health."
"9486852","Infectious diarrhea afflicts a billion people a year and is responsible for 4% of all human deaths. Many of the 2,500 serovars of nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica are common causes of infectious diarrhea in the general population, active military servicemen and veterans. As is the case for Salmonella, the number of bacteria resistant to antibiotics is steadily increasing. Antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacilli is becoming a clinical problem of epic proportions with few therapeutic agents in the horizon. Future prophylactic and therapeutic approaches against drug resistant bacteria will greatly benefit from a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis. The research of our group and many others has shown critical roles for the RNA polymerase regulatory protein DksA in the pathogenesis of multiple Gram-negative bacilli, including Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, Pseudomonas, and Vibrio. We have discovered that conserved cysteine residues in the DksA zinc finger are not only important for Salmonella pathogenesis but also represent a novel sensor of oxidative stress. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that the DksA zinc finger forms a stable sulfenic acid in response to low levels of oxidative stress, thereby activating transcription. At higher levels of oxidative stress, however, the oxidoreductase activity of the DnaJ chaperone catalyzes disulfide bond formation in DksA zinc finger, a redox state that represses gene transcription. This model is highly innovative because it defines DksA as a thiol multiplex with discrete regulatory outputs according to degree of oxidation of cysteine residues in the zinc finger. Our investigations will contribute to a deeper understanding of critical steps in bacterial pathogenesis and will also help the rational development of antibiotics against phylogenetically diverse Gram-negative bacilli. Based on our basic knowledge of DksA, we have already identified a drug that targets a pocket at the tip of the coiled-coil domain of this RNA polymerase regulatory protein. This novel compound has excellent antibiotic activity against Salmonella and E. coli. The proposed research will help develop and test novel antibiotics against conserved pockets in DksA. Our investigations will aid with the rational development of future therapies against a variety of Gram-negative, often antibiotic resistant, bacteria that cause high rates of morbidity and mortality in veterans and their families."

"9502764","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are few treatments for persistent impulsive aggression in individuals with severe neuropsychiatric disorders, and existing treatments are of limited efficacy yet confer the potential for significant side effects. Aggression contributes to repeat institutionalization and significant costs to healthcare and criminal justice systems. As a neuroscientist and board-certified psychiatrist, this mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will provide training to support Dr. Lewis's goal of becoming an independent translational investigator focused on the development of novel therapeutic approaches informed by the neural circuitry regulating impulsive aggression. To accomplish his career and research goals, Dr. Lewis will receive training in translational neuroscience by acquiring new skills to manipulate neural circuitry in mice and humans, identify effects on behaviors related to impulsive aggression, and rigorously analyze resulting data. Training will be guided by a team of mentors and contributors who are leaders in the basic and translational science of neural circuits underlying behavior relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders as well as in statistical analysis. The research plan is supplemented by coursework at Yale in translational neuroscience and statistical modeling, as well as participation in relevant seminars and national scientific meetings. The proposed experiments build upon preliminary data in mouse models demonstrating that activation of ?7 nicotinic receptors in the dentate gyrus (DG) reduces aggressive behavior, while reduction of ?7 receptors increases aggressive behavior. Because ?7 receptors are highly enriched on local inhibitory interneurons of the DG and their activation enhances DG and hippocampal inhibition, the hypothesis will be tested that hippocampal excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance governs the expression of aggressive behavior in mice and humans. In Aim 1, activity of excitatory or inhibitory neurons in the mouse DG will be recorded using fiber photometry and manipulated using optogenetics to determine how DG E/I balance influences aggression onset in real time during resident- intruder tests. In Aim 2, this circuit mechanism will be translated to human subjects with schizophrenia using a pharmacological probe. The ?7 partial agonist GTS-21 will be orally administered to enhance hippocampal inhibition, and an Emotional Go/NoGo Task used to determine effects on impulsive responding to negative and neutral valence stimuli. This behavioral task is mediated by prefrontal-temporolimbic circuitry, including the hippocampus, and performance correlates with a history of impulsive aggression in schizophrenia patients. These focused experiments take an innovative translational approach in mice and humans to understand how hippocampal activity influences behavioral measures related to impulsive aggression in neuropsychiatric disorders. Training in contemporary techniques of translational neuroscience, deliberate integration of animal and human paradigms, and data analysis will serve as a critical foundation to support Dr. Lewis's independent translational research career focused on identifying novel therapeutic options for impulsive aggression."
"9412376","PROJECT SUMMARY  Parkinson?s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and ~60,000 veterans currently receive care for PD from the VA Health Care System annually. PD is characterized by progressive motor decline and cognitive impairment. Despite significant medical burden, our understanding of the pathogenesis of PD and therapies remain limited.  Mutations in the gene glucosidase, beta acid 1 (GBA1) are the strongest genetic risk factor for developing idiopathic PD, increasing risk by ~5-fold in GBA1 mutation carriers compared to controls. However, most individuals with GBA1 mutations do not develop PD, suggesting that additional genetic modifiers influence PD susceptibility. Identification of these modifiers would provide insight into the pathogenesis of PD, and reveal novel targets for disease-modifying therapies. The proposed work focuses on identifying genetic modifiers of GBA1-mediated neurodegeneration using a Drosophila GBA1 deficient model, using these modifiers to understand the pathogenic mechanisms causing PD, and determining whether modifiers identified in Drosophila translate to clinically relevant modifiers of human disease.  Candidate modifiers will be identified through a genetic screen using a GBA1 deficient Drosophila model that I have developed (Aim 1). Two candidate modifiers, brainwashing (bwa) and glucosylceramide transferase 1 (GlcT-1) have already been identified in preliminary work. The function of these modifiers in ceramide metabolism suggests that decreased levels of ceramide may be responsible for GBA1-mediated neurodegeneration. I hypothesize that decreased ceramide levels impair fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes, causing neurodegeneration. I will test this hypothesis by identifying alterations of lipid abundances in GBA1 mutant and control flies with overexpression or loss of function of bwa and GlcT-1, and examining resulting effects on autophagy flux and autophagosome morphology (Aim 2). I will also test whether increasing levels of ceramide directly through dietary supplementation can ameliorate GBA1 mutant phenotypes, including impaired autophagy. These studies will elucidate the mechanistic link between lipid metabolism and pathologic protein aggregation in GBA1-mediated pathogenesis, which has remained elusive. In Aim 3, I will test whether bwa and GlcT-1 are also modifiers of human disease, by analyzing human homologs of these modifiers for association with rate of progression of symptoms in a longitudinal cohort of GBA1 carriers and noncarriers with PD (Aim 3).  The proposed work uses several innovative approaches, including a novel invertebrate model of GBA1 deficiency manifesting phenotypes suggestive of PD, testing the role of lipid metabolism on autophagy through genetic perturbations and dietary supplementation, and attempting to translate findings from a Drosophila model to PD patients. This work will significantly advance our understanding of PD pathogenesis, and could reveal novel therapeutic targets and new lipidomic biomarkers.  I plan to use the proposed methodologies in Aims 2 and 3 to investigate the mechanisms of additional modifiers identified through the proposed work. This will provide exciting avenues for new discoveries, elucidate pathogenic mechanisms responsible for PD, and form the basis for a Merit Award proposal, to be submitted during the CDA2. My interests in lipid metabolism alterations contributing to neurodegeneration, and translation of findings from a Drosophila model to a cohort of PD patients already differentiate me from my mentors, and the additional training in these areas will allow me to successfully transition to an independent researcher combining mechanistic experimental work in Drosophila with clinically relevant findings in humans."
"9472329","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An interdisciplinary consortium of investigators from the Departments of Medicine, Pharmacology, Ophthalmology, Pediatrics and Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, in collaboration with the University of Michigan, Harvard University, and Boston University proposes to increase the pace at which basic science discoveries on disease mechanisms can be translated into therapies for complex visual system disorders and disease, a stated goal of the R24 National Eye Institute (NEI) Translational Research Program on Therapy for Visual Disorders. This scientific partnership will employ its diverse scientific expertise to characterize and test potential therapies for diabetic and other ischemic retinopathies in animal models by using a combination of cutting-edge physiological, chemical, analytical and imaging approaches. By identifying drugs with the capability to inhibit clinically important lesions of the early stages of diabetic retinopathy in animal models, we will accelerate their development before testing in humans. Improving drug delivery to the retina will also be a high priority. Conventional and emerging technologies together with high resolution imaging methods will be used noninvasively to assess various processes in the retina, and document the effect of therapies. Specific goals of this project are to: 1. Use retinylamine as the lead compound to develop and test the ability of other amino-containing compounds (derivatives from chemical libraries and chemicals synthesized especially for this project) to trap reactive aldehydes and/or inhibit superoxide generation by retinal cells incubated in glucose concentrations similar to those found in diabetes. A systems pharmacology approach will be employed to evaluate the ability of a second group of compounds consisting of agonists and antagonists of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to achieve similar therapeutic effects. 2. Test the best of these compounds singly and in combination for their ability to (a) inhibit lesions of the non-proliferative stage of diabetic retinopathy (increased capillary permeability and degeneration) in rodents and primates, and (b) inhibit capillary dropout and pre-retinal neovascularization in the oxygen- induced retinopathy model. 3. Assess the retention and efficacy of promising test drugs delivered to the retina by different routes compared to systemic delivery. An important criterion for selection of compounds for further study is that they do not impair visual function at the doses used. Ultimately, results of these interrelated aims will guide us in identifying the most promising therapeutics for further development in reducing retinopathy and vision loss in diabetic individuals."
"9457464","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mycobacteria tuberculosis (Mtb) causes the deadly infectious disease, tuberculosis, which continues to plague the world's population, with an estimated one third of the world infected. CarD and RbpA have recently been identified as direct RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding proteins that are essential regulators of transcription in the pathogen Mtb. CarD is widely distributed among bacteria, including Mycobacterium and Thermus species. Our preliminary results indicate that CarD utilizes a distinct molecular mechanism for regulating transcription.  RbpA is a regulator of RNAP found only in the actinomycete family of bacteria, including Streptomyces coelicolor (Sco) and Mtb. Like CarD, RbpA has no similarity to other transcription regulators, is essential for growth in mycobacteria and also positively regulates rRNA transcription.  Both CarD and RpbA are unusual transcription regulators that do not function according to the standard paradigm for bacterial transcription activators. We propose a combination of in vitro structural and biochemical approaches, and in vivo approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanisms for transcription regulation by CarD and RbpA.  Preliminary results include crystal structures of thermus transcription initiation complexes containing CarD (4 -resolution). We propose to improve on these structural results, use biochemical and biophysical approaches to test hypotheses that arise from these structures as well as to confirm that Mtb CarD functions through the same mechanism as thermus CarD.  We have also obtained a 2.2 -resolution crystal structure of Mtb RbpA bound to one of its RNAP targets, the Mtb sA. We propose biochemical and biophysical approaches to test hypotheses that arise from this structure and to map additional interactions with the mycobacterial RNAP. Finally, we propose to crystallize and determine the structure of mycobacterial RNAP transcription initiation complexes."
"9269315","Abstract: This proposal focuses on understanding the relationship between dietary patterns and risk of obesity in Hispanic women. This is an important issue in the realm of health disparities because neariy 80% of Hispanic women in the United States are ovenweight or obese and obesity increases risk for numerous chronic diseases, including breast cancer. The overall goal of this project Is to test the metabolic response to Western -and Indigenous Mexican diets in Hispanic women. We will also investigate whether ancestral genetic variation mediates the response to each diet. We hypothesize that the biological response to a Western dietary pattern produces detrimental metabolic profiles favoring adipose deposition, which leads to increased risk of adverse health events, including increased risk of breast cancer. Conversely, we hypothesize that the physiologic response to an Indigenous Mexican diet will produce a favorable metabolic profile. We further hypothesize that genetic ancestry mediates this biological response to a Western dietary pattern. Our primary aims are: (1) To test in a randomized cross-over experimental feeding study the metabolic response to an Indigenous Mexican diet vs. a Western diet in 50 first and second generation Hispanic women living in the greater Seattle area. The metabolic response will be measured by blood concentrations ofthe following biomarkers assessed before and after each feeding period: insulin, glucose, IGFI, IGFBP3, leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, CRP and SAA; and (2) To investigate whether genetic characteristics, as assessed with Ancestry Informative Markers, mediate the metabolic response to each tested diet. As secondary alms we will examine measures of hunger and satiety during each diet test period and genetic predictors of adiposity. This project will provide important data for understanding the etiology of obesity in i-lispanic women, which can be used to design effective programs for prevention."

"9462724","OUTREACH, RECRUITMENT & EDUCATION CORE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The MADRC Outreach, Recruitment, and Education Core has transitioned to new leadership over the past two years and has refocused its mission on community outreach and facilitating rapid enrollment into MADRC affiliated clinical research studies. The evolution of our field towards earlier detection and intervention in AD presents new challenges for public education and for recruitment of diverse participants into biomarker intensive studies. We seek to provide leadership in increasing public awareness about the critical importance of participation in AD clinical research and develop accessible information on the evolving concepts of very early AD. Over the past cycle, we supported the highly successful recruitment and retention of subjects for the Longitudinal Cohort as well as multiple MADRC affiliated clinical research projects and national multi-center studies, including ADNI, DIAN, ADCS and industry sponsored clinical trials. We have now instituted a proactive needs assessment for the Longitudinal Cohort (LC) and to support new MADRC affiliated research and national multi-center projects. We are working closely with the Clinical Core on retention of the Longitudinal Cohort, particularly participants from under-represented minorities, and to build a comprehensive Research Registry to supplement the LC in identifying clinically normal individuals and symptomatic patients who are ready to enroll in clinical research projects. We propose several new programs to serve the diversity recruitment needs of our Center, including an innovative Participant Ambassador Program and partnership with the Clinical Core on the new Spanish Memory Clinic. We are expanding our outreach to local community health and senior centers to increase the diversity of research participants. We are also reinvigorating our partnership with a diverse Community Advisory Board to better understand the potential barriers to enrolling participants from under-represented minority communities into intensive clinical trials with biomarker and imaging procedures, such as the ADCS Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic AD (A4) secondary prevention trial. We will coordinate with the newly proposed Neuroimaging Core, and our colleagues at other ADCs, to develop informative materials to educate the public and professionals about the appropriate use of PET amyloid imaging and methods to safely disclose information about amyloid status to research participants. We will implement quantitative metrics to assess our impact in community education programs and will develop anonymous subject satisfaction questionnaires to further improve the experience of our research participants. We remain committed to training young investigators and clinicians about the importance of early detection of AD and related dementias, and will support educational forums focused on advances in AD research, both locally and nationally, as well as working with the educational components of each of the MADRC cores to enhance training programs across the Center."

The specific aims of Core D are as follows: (1) to arrange and perform autopsies on clinically well-characterized subjects enrolled through the JHMI ADRC and assist with consensus diagnoses on ADRC subjects (including the Clinic Cohort and the BLSA Cohort), (2) to accession and store optimally prepared tissues from the autopsies and to make these specimens available to investigators associated with the ADRC and at other collaborating institutions, (3) to accession and store samples of biological fluids and DNA obtained pre- and postmortem from subjects in the ADRC, (4) to facilitate APOE genotyping on participants in the ADRC, (5) to maintain a database for the integration of neuropathologic and clinical data, and the completion of the NACC Neuropathology Data Form, (6) to support the assessment of genetically engineered mouse models relevant to Alzheimer s disease (AD) and related disorders, and (7) to train basic investigators and clinical neuroscientists in the morphological and diagnostic concepts relevant to AD, to other types of dementias and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite recent advances in neuroimaging, postmortem examination remains critical to elucidate the etiology in cases of dementia and to confirm the diagnosis of AD. Furthermore, autopsy is also important to identify comorbidities, which are common in older subjects. The availability of biological fluids and postmortem tissues has become increasingly important for the research and development of biomarkers of AD. In this realm, Core D is expanding its postmortem tissue collection to include a large number of specimens from younger subjects (<50 years) suitable to examine the very early stages of AD pathology and its pathogenesis."
"9657472","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular mechanisms underlying uveitis (intraocular inflammation) are poorly understood, a major barrier to progress in treating the disease or designing specific therapeutics. This proposal builds on our exciting discovery that Autosomal Dominant Neovascular Inflammatory Vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV; a type of uveitis) can be caused by mutations in the cysteine protease CAPN5 (calpain-5), one member of a family of proteins that uses proteolysis to control a spectrum of molecular events. Thus, CAPN5 is the first nonsyndromic uveitis gene to be identified, which now makes possible a highly innovative molecular-genetic approach to identifying the factors responsible for intraocular inflammation, neovascularization, and fibrosis. The long-term goals of our research are to identify new therapeutic targets for uveitis. Our objective in this proposal is to identify the structure-functin mechanism of calpain-5 mutations that activate molecular pathways leading to uveitis and probe inhibitor interactions. Our central hypothesis is that ADNIV mutations increase calpain-5 proteolytic activity and are amenable to structure guided inhibition that will eventually be used t prevent retinal inflammation. Our rationale is that, intracellular calpain-5 activity is normally a tightly controlled proteolytic switch for activating signaling molecules, and when calpain-5 is hyperactive, target signals are tripped pathogenically. Excess calpain activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide range of human diseases including cancer, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and muscular dystrophy. Although little is known about CAPN5, our preliminary studies suggest ADNIV disease mutants increase CAPN5 enzymatic activity through structural changes and alter cellular transcription. Our specific aims are to test the hypotheses that: (1) ADNIV mutants alter CAPN5 catalytic and proteolytic activity in vitro; (2) CAPN5 and ADNIV residues affect activity of other calpains; and (3) ADNIV mutations alter CAPN5 structure using circular dichroism spectroscopy, small angle x-ray scattering SAXS, and crystallization. We will use novel enzymatic methods and modeling to pursue studies that trace the molecular mechanism of CAPN5 mutations. Our work should have a significant positive impact on identifying new molecular mechanisms for therapeutic intervention of uveitis. At the completion of these experiments, we expect to have in hand a CAPN5 catalytic activity assays that can ultimately be used for low and high-throughput drug screening. We also expect to resolve the structure of the protein, which will expose differences between CAPN5 and its orthologs. Since the ADNIV phenocopies other eye diseases, our studies promise to have a broad positive impact, beyond ADNIV and uveitis patients, where components of the CAPN5 pathway may be therapeutic targets."
"9607407","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the project team is to develop a robust, multi-lab research framework, enabled by large scale imaging, which will lead to principled integrative models of ethologically-relevant behaviors that incorporate a detailed knowledge of individual cell classes. The specific neurobiological question that the team will address is how the brain integrates sensory information in order to guide locomotion in a particular direction. Our strategy is to systematically map and functionally characterize the neural circuits that underlie goal-directed locomotion, using the fruit fly, Drosophila, in order to exploit the convergence of powerful genetic, optical, behavioral, and analytical tools that are available in this species. The proposal focuses primarily on refining functional imaging approaches to map the activity of small brain regions and populations of individual neurons in intact, behaving animals while they respond to a controlled panel of sensory stimuli. We have constructed a strategic plan consisting of seven interrelated research modules that create a flow for discovery that starts with functional imaging and ends with the development of integrative models for sensory-guided behavior. The goal of this proposal is to bring all research modules to the requisite level of maturity for future research. To achieve this goal this project will develop robust, quantitative and high throughput methods for: Functional 2-photon imaging using pan-neural drivers. ArcLight imaging using selected driver lines. Functional 2-photon imaging using pan-neural drivers. Circuit analysis of sensory motor pathways. And a plan for an integrative computational model of sensory-guided locomotion."
"9553351","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Hepatic fibrosis is a progressive condition resulting from a number of causes, including hepatitis, alcohol abuse, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which can ultimately lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Cirrhosis affects 900,000 persons, and the underlying causes (alcohol abuse and hepatitis infection) are more prevalent in the veteran population. There are currently few treatment options. Our previous studies showed that the hormone relaxin is effective in treating established hepatic fibrosis. Our recent data using mice lacking the relaxin receptor RXFP1 plays additional roles in hepatocyte regeneration and prevention of apoptosis. We have found evidence that relaxin triggers cross-talk between hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes, by promoting the release of a soluble factor from stellate cells that stimulates hepatocyte proliferation. We have identified hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as the likely factor affected. We also found that relaxin activation of RXFP1 activates the transcription factor PPAR? in an unconventional manner. Recently, new activators of PPAR? have been produced that promote insulin sensitivity, but do not cause the negative side effects of full agonist activators, making them attractive new antidiabetic treatments but their effect on fibrosis was unknown. Our preliminary data suggests that one of these selective PPAR? agonists, SR1664, reduces established hepatic fibrosis much more effectively than traditional PPAR? activators. Furthermore, the insulin-sensitizing properties of SR1664 provide the potential for treatment not only of the fibrosis itself, but also the metabolic dysfunction associated with alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Despite these findings, little is known about the role of relaxinin liver regeneration and apoptosis in other models of liver injury, how relaxin acts to regulate the PPAR? pathway, or the efficacy of selective PPAR? activation in fibrotic and metabolic liver disease. Our central hypothesis is that relaxin and selective PPAR? activation can reduce fibrosis and promote hepatocyte regeneration through HGF. To test this hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims: 1. Establish the role of relaxin signaling in hepatic injury and repair 2. Determine the mechanism for the HSC-hepatocyte interaction regulated by relaxin. 3. Determine the efficacy of selective activation of PPAR? in models of fibrotic and metabolic liver disease. In Aim 1, total and tissue-specific RXFP1-null mice will be subject to models of early and late liver injury, and the degree of damage and liver regeneration will be compared with wild-type mice. Altered signaling pathways and cell cycle proteins will be defined. In Aim 2, liver  cells from wild-type and knockout mice will be used to define the relaxin-stimulated soluble factors released by HSC to stimulate hepatocyte proliferation and repress apoptosis. In vivo, HGF treatment will be used to rescue the defect in liver repair after injury. In Aim 3, the PPAR? selective activator SR1664 will be used to treat experimental models of fibrotic and metabolic liver disease. Tissue-specific PPAR?-null mice will be used to identify the respective roles of liver cell populations on the effect of SR1664 and relaxin. Taken together, successful completion of these Aims will provide critical new insights into potential new approaches to the treatment not only of hepatic fibrosis, but also metabolic liver diseases as well. This would provide the potential expand the role of relaxin beyond fibrosis to the spectrum of liver diseases and comorbidities, which is a major issue not only in the population at-large, but particularly in the veteran population, in which liver disease and comorbidities are more prevalent."
"9462788","Core B: Clinical Core Project Summary/Abstract The Clinical Core is critical to achieving the ultimate goal of the UCI ADRC, which is to identify means to prevent, mitigate, and eradicate Alzheimer's disease (AD), by translating basic research findings into clinical advances. As such, the objective of the Clinical Core is to recruit and longitudinally characterize human participants who span the spectrum of normal human aging, preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. This will include collection of neurological, neuropsychological, novel biomarker, and stem cell data. Recognizing the heterogeneity of AD and the importance of studying AD across the lifespan, the Clinical Core follows 3 cohorts: (1) The longitudinal cohort which is central to all ADCs has a fundamental role in the characterization of healthy older adults as well as participants in pre-clinical, early stage, and AD dementia. (2) A special cohort of adults with Down syndrome represents the largest group of individuals with early-onset AD, and provides insights into preclinical AD pathogenesis. (3) A special cohort of the oldest old provides data on successful aging, yet remain at high risk of developing AD and other dementias, and represent the fastest- growing segment of the U.S. population. The Clinical Core will provide well-characterized participants, their data and biospecimens, and ultimately brain tissue for the Data Core for sharing with NACC, for the IPS Cell Core for generation and study of IPS cells, for the Neuropathology Core for genetic, biomarker, and neuropathological study and submission to NCRAD, and for the Projects which will include MRI imaging studies, neuropathological studies, and use of IPS cells. In addition, the Clinical Core will provide participants for multi-center imaging initiatives and multi-center AD prevention and clinical trials, including ADCS trials. Recognizing the long preclinical course of AD and the importance of individuals with preclinical AD for epidemiologic, prevention, and treatment research, the Clinical Core will establish a registry of individuals with normal cognition but at high risk of developing AD due to advanced age or presence of amyloid biomarker. The Clinical Core will interact with the ORE Core to increase underserved minority participation in AD clinical research, including individuals with Down syndrome and Chinese-Americans. Finally, the Clinical Core will provide a rich training environment to educate the next generation of AD researchers and clinicians."
"9473654","TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is the major aggregating disease protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Over 90% of ALS cases exhibit pathological lesions containing detergent insoluble deposits of phosphorylated, truncated, and ubiquitinated TDP-43 protein. TDP-43 phosphorylated at S409/410 (pS409/410) is the most consistent, robust, and specific neuropathological feature of ALS suggesting a phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP) mediated cascade of neurotoxicity. Furthermore pTDP has been shown to influence the aggregation of TDP-43 in cultured cells and in human ALS cases. Our previous work demonstrated pS409/410 TDP-43 mediates motor neuron toxicity of familial ALS-causing TDP-43 mutations. Kinases regulating TDP-43 phosphorylation present an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in ALS. We have identified a well-conserved TDP-43- active kinase with translational potential known as tau tubulin kinase 1 (TTBK1). Identification of brain penetrant TTBK1 inhibitors may ultimately provide a viable drug development strategy. We hypothesize that increased TDP-43 phosphorylation drives motor neuron degeneration in ALS and that blocking pTDP accumulation by inhibiting TTBK1 will protect against TDP-43 mediated neurodegeneration in ALS. Three integrated specific aims are proposed: 1) Identification of TTBK1 selective kinase inhibitors. 2) Optimization of TTBK1 selective inhibitors and validation of selective compounds in a cellular model of pTDP accumulation. 3) Validation of the role of TTBK1 in the formation of pTDP using TTBK1 knockout mice and an existing transgenic model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. The studies proposed here will set the stage for development of TTBK1 selective inhibitors as a candidate therapeutic approach for ALS."
"9487775","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Cambodia increased sharply in the 1990s, reaching upwards of 40% among high-risk populations.2 While the prevalence rate declined to approximately 0.9% by 2006, it remains inflated among high-risk groups.3 In the wake of the epidemic, the Cambodian government initiated national data collection and disease monitoring efforts that have produced rich, longitudinal data from HIV/AIDS treatment and surveillance programs. However, a shortage of professionals trained to manage and interpret these types of data, persists. The UCLA Department of Epidemiology and the Cambodian University of Health Sciences (UHS) propose a program to train a cohort of Cambodian public health professionals in the management, analysis and evaluation of secondary data. Trainees will have two tracks from which to choose. The UCLA MS/MPH track requires coursework in epidemiologic methods and principles, biostatistics, data management, behavioral sciences and HIV/AIDS epidemiology. This track also requires completion of a master's project that must be relevant for HIV/AIDS policy development in Cambodia. The UCLA PhD track requires trainees complete core courses in epidemiology as well as courses in logic, causation and probability, the biology of HIV/AIDS, graduate statistics and pass a qualifying exam. Trainees then carry out a dissertation in Cambodia that is relevant to HIV/AIDS policy. The overall program will be assessed based on trainee progress and matriculation rates; thesis/dissertation quality, policy relevance and the proportion published; the program's impact on UHS recruitment rates and trainee placement in national HIV/AIDS monitoring and data analysis roles."
"9543292","ABSTRACT: PROJECT 3 One of the goals of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Superfund Research Program (SRP) is the development of methods and technologies to detect, assess and evaluate the effects of toxic substances on human health. To address the issue of high analysis costs for assessing toxic substances in the environment as well as the need for measuring indicators of exposure to humans, this project will develop new immunoassays, improve the utility of the assays, and apply them (in collaboration with other investigators in the UC Davis SRP Center). A complement to gas or liquid chromatography (GC or LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), immunoassays are characterized by their speed, sensitivity, high throughput and low cost, which is underscored by their long history of use in clinical diagnostics. This project proposes three aims: Aim I is to make strategic improvements to an emerging antibody technology (called VHH or nanobody), which will vastly change the field of immunodiagnostics, including testing for small environmental molecules. Aim II is to develop new assays for compounds of concern to the community partner, identified by the Bioremediation project (Project 1), and the SRP that can be used to assess hazardous chemicals in the environment and in humans. Some of the high-priority compounds for assay development include coumarin rodenticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides and their degradation products. In this same realm of antibody development, the second aim includes a collaboration with Projects 4 and 5 to develop antibodies for protein targets needed to enhance the throughput of Western blot technology. Western blots are critical components of diagnostic testing to identify the effects of toxic chemical exposure. With improved efficiency, more chemicals can be screened and a better grasp of the toxic effects can be discerned. Aim III is to advance field methods for chemical detection by developing new immunodiagnostic technologies and applying them to real-world sampling needs. Through a collaboration with the Lab-on-a-Chip Nanosensing Platforms project (Project 2), classical antibodies as well as newly developed VHH reagents will be used in novel biosensors and membrane-based platforms. These new technologies will emphasize field portability, high sample throughput, and ease of use by the end-user, in order augment the Program's research translation and community engagement efforts. Such technologies will be used to empower communities to collect data in response to their environmental chemical concerns. Ultimately, the immunoassays developed in this project will be valuable tools for stakeholders who wish to detect chemical exposures and biomarkers of their toxicity."
"9600723","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that is responsible for the conformational maturation of more than 200 client protein substrates, many of which are directly associated with cell signaling, and thus, are often hijacked during malignant transformation. Consequently, through Hsp90 inhibition, multiple signaling pathways can be disrupted simultaneously. As a result, Hsp90 has emerged as a promising anti-cancer target, and there are currently 17 inhibitors undergoing clinical evaluation. Unfortunately, all of these molecule bind to the Hsp90 N-terminal binding site, and also induce the pro-survival heat shock response at the same concentration they inhibit the Hsp90 protein folding machinery. The net result is generally, cytostatic activity and the potential for chemotherapeutic resistance. Unlike N-terminal inhibitors, C-terminal inhibitors can segregate these activities, which have led to unforeseen opportunities for the development of useful anti-cancer agents. In fact, C-terminal inhibitors do not induce the heat shock response and consequently, induce apoptosis against many cancer cells with high differential selectivity. The first C-terminal inhibitor identified was novobiocin, which manifests an IC50 value of ~700 micromolar. During the past few years, we have modified this coumarin antibiotic and transformed it into a potential clinical lead compound that exhibits ~100 nM activity. In this proposal, we aim to further develop this class of compounds and to evaluate them in animal models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in an effort to provide additional evidence to support their clinical application against a varietyof cancers."
"9455654","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Changes in the epidemiology of head and neck cancers have resulted in an increasing number of younger and healthier patients being treated with definitive external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The long-term sequelae of radiotherapy in a patient population with good clinical outcomes and extended life expectancy are becoming increasingly relevant in the management of treatment-associated morbidity and mortality.  Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the mandible is a challenging issue related to irradiation, occurring in up to 16% of patients with various types of head and neck cancers. Altered bone vascularity and opportunistic infections within the oral cavity contribute to the development of ORN, leading to an inexorable process of bone destruction that does not follow the normal sequence of healing events. Early-stage ORN is often managed using antibiotics, local wound care, and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). Advanced ORN requires surgical resection and reconstruction with healthy non-irradiated tissue. Successful management of this disease process requires an enhanced ability to identify patients at risk for ORN, monitor the effectiveness of conservative management, and improve preoperative planning to ensure clear margins at the time of resection. However, a standardized, objective staging and monitoring system for ORN is not currently available.  Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a clinically available quantitative imaging method that is increasingly employed to assess microvascular function in the study of solid tumors of the head and neck. At our institution, DCE-MRI is integrated into a multimodality clinical algorithm aimed at improving the diagnosis, staging, and oncologic surveillance of head and neck tumors. DCE-MRI can detect altered bone vascularity associated with bone healing, necrosis and metastatic involvement, with excellent spatial resolution. We hypothesize that DCE-MRI can be used to detect alterations in bone vascularity following irradiation to monitor ORN clinical progression and response to treatment. To test this hypothesis, we will evaluate the potential of DCE-MRI to identify patients at risk for mandibular ORN, monitor response to conservative management, and determine the extent of advanced mandibular ORN to assist in surgical planning.  Successful completion of this proposal has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and management of mandibular ORN. For the first time, clinicians will be able to identify patients at risk for ORN and manage post-radiotherapy care appropriately. The effectiveness of currently employed conservative measures could be tested using an objective measure and improved preoperative planning could reduce the rate of surgical failure due to residual compromised bone."
"9445867","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Optimal self-management of a chronic illness results in minimizing its negative impact on life. Thus, it includes managing its effects on life as well as medical self-management. Yet self-management interventions typically focus only on medical management. This is a problem because 1) up to 35% of youth with IBD experience clinically significant difficulty in other areas of self-management, particularly in managing the social and overall impact of the disease on life (e.g., quality of life), even when the disease is inactive; and 2) these problems are predictive of occupational, social and emotional problems in adulthood. In IBD, $5.5 billion is lost each year in workforce nonparticipation alone. This suggests youth with IBD are at continued risk for inadequate self- management of the effect of IBD on their lives as adults. The objective of this study is to address these areas of impairment that persist even during remission with a multifaceted peer mentoring program. Mentoring programs are common in the general population and are well-known to improve a plethora of outcomes, including social, emotional and academic outcomes, all of which are necessary for successfully managing life with IBD. Peer mentoring programs in particular offer innovative advantages over other forms of intervention for youth with IBD: 1) A peer mentor is a role model who normalizes and de-stigmatizes the disease in a way that a professional cannot, and 2) With a peer mentor, self-management activities take place within the community, promoting generalization and independence in ways that traditional interventions do not. Despite widespread enthusiasm for peer mentoring in pediatric chronic illness, such programs have received little empirical attention. Our mentoring program was developed via focus groups, an NIH-funded pilot study, national mentoring resources, and the PI's 10 years of experience with Big Brothers Big Sisters. It consists of year-long, 1:1 mentee-mentor relationships with group self-management activities, a private online community, and a parent support component. Our pilot study demonstrates feasibility, satisfaction, and improvement in the areas of quality of life (QOL), functioning in typical life activities, IBD self-efficacy, and rates of remission. In the proposed study, 200 youth and their parents, and 100 mentors will be enrolled in this multisite, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing those in the Mentoring Program to an Educational Activity comparison group in the areas of QOL, functioning in typical life activities, and disease outcomes (e.g., biomarker and standardized indices). Mechanisms that contribute to outcomes, including perceived stigma, disease-related self-efficacy, coping and disease uncertainty will be examined as well. A mentoring program is an innovative self-management intervention with broad appeal and applicability across chronic illnesses that can help youth manage areas of impairment that persist even with inactive disease, and potentially into adulthood."
"9462243","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on more than a decade of joint Fogarty and NIAID research and training support to our two universities, The UNC-Wits AIDS Implementation Science and Cohort Analyses Training Grant will train Wits junior faculty and advanced trainees and strengthen the MSc in Epidemiology by creating a new concentration of implementation science at the Wits School of Public Health. South Africa continues to have an HIV epidemic with 5.6 million living with HIV/ AIDS, the most of any country, and 270,000 deaths annually. Implementation science is crucial to understand how HIV programs are working and develop strategies for improved effectiveness, to determine how proven interventions can be scaled up effectively, to conduct research, and provide informed answers to SA government and international agencies. The current method of sending SA trainees overseas for long term training is costly, not sustainable, increases the risks of the trainees not returning, jeopardizes their jobs and families at home, and often exposes them to courses not directly relevant to their home countries. There are no implementation science training programs in Sub- Saharan Africa. Trainees from Wits Faculty of Health Science schools and its alumni from diverse backgrounds (nursing, public health, medicine, pharmacy, dental) will participate in a 3 year, 12 course curriculum (long- term) co-taught by UNC and Wits faculty leading to an MPH or MSc in Epidemiology with a concentration in Implementation Science. Additional students will take at least one course (medium and short-term) of the curriculum and receive a certificate. The content, identified by the Wits SPH faculty as gaps in their curriculum, include database development and management, longitudinal analysis and causal inference, health economics, spatial analysis and GIS in public health, m-health, systems analysis, monitoring and evaluation, qualitative and formative research. To save on costs, all courses will be taught on site in 2 week intensive blocks. During years 4 and 5, the courses would start over again, with more responsibility taken by the Wits faculty and previous Fogarty funded trainees (train the trainers). Those obtaining a Masters or a PhD would work on existing long term South African HIV cohorts including Right to Care, IeDEA, and Hlabisa. Advanced students would take a year-long grant writing program with the expectation of submitting a grant. Long term sustainability would be guaranteed by incorporating the courses into the Wits curriculum taught by Wits faculty. We have commitments of additional funding and in-kind contributions from UNC and Wits totaling $350,000 over 5 years. By the end of the 5 years we expect to have funded 20 MSc or MPH students, 4 PhD graduates, 6 Wits faculty in specific course methodologies, as well as up to 160 students taking at least one module. This proposal will increase the depth and breadth of this research training and develop a critical mass of South African investigators and Wits faculty who will conduct synergistic research."
"9551498","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Alcohol dependence (alcoholism) is a common condition in veterans and alcohol abuse is a complicating factor in most chronic medical and psychiatric illnesses. Although alcoholism is substantially (40-60%) genetically determined, the genetic determinants of risk are largely unknown, hindering effective prevention and treatment of dependent individuals. For these reasons and more, there is a clear need to expand pharmacotherapy options for alcohol abuse and dependence to improve outcomes and sustained abstinence.  Although no animal model duplicates clinically-defined alcoholism, models for specific factors (including withdrawal/negative effect, which constitutes a motivational force that perpetuates alcohol use and contributes to relapse) are useful to identify potential determinants of liability and pharmacotherapy in humans. A unique strength of this proposal is that we show for the first time that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an FDA approved antioxidant, mitigates alcohol withdrawal. An important goal of this research proposal is to characterize NAC efficacy to reduce withdrawal (convulsions, anxiety-like behavior) in dependent mice. Using preclinical models, we were also the first to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) with proven, large effects on alcohol physical dependence and associated withdrawal. One hypothesis that has emerged from our work is that the QTL of largest effect (Adw1) may also affect alcohol seeking behavior. Adw1 is also unique in that it affects alcohol but not pentobarbital withdrawal, providing an important clue to its mechanism of action. Notably, ethanol exposure and withdrawal introduce oxidative stress, while pentobarbital has neutral or anti-oxidative effects in the brain.  Some of the most useful tools that we have created thus far are congenic mice with the Adw1 region from a donor strain introgressed onto a different genetic background. These genetic models have been invaluable to map Adw1 to a small interval and identify high-quality candidate genes, the most promising of which (so far) have roles in oxidative homeostasis/stress; and gene co-expression network analyses using Adw1 congenics indicate disruption of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Thus, a hypothesis that has emerged from our data is the idea that oxidative homeostasis/stress may play an important role in genetic vulnerability to alcohol physical dependence and withdrawal, and that this pathway may also be a pharmacotherapeutic target to manage withdrawal and beyond. We have now published the first studies of mitochondria respiratory complex activities and organization in the mouse brain and find remarkable genetic differences, providing a framework to gain mechanistic information. Although NAC is thought to affect this pathway, it may have additional actions that could also contribute to its therapeutic efficacy. Using a systems biology network approach, we will assess both possibilities to provide additional mechanistic information. Interestingly, a growing body of evidence implicates natural variation in oxidative homeostasis in genetically influenced differences in mice, disproportionately affecting the brain, so we expect that our results may direct research beyond the addictions."
"9466602","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant deficits in reciprocal social interactions, impaired communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors, with a prevalence of 1 in 68 children in the US. Early intervention programs have been shown to be effective for improving IQ, language, and social skills for toddlers as young as 18 months of age. Diagnosis of ASD is currently based solely on clinical and parental observations, as a laboratory-based diagnostic test for ASD based on robust biomarkers does not exist currently. Our team previously demonstrated that lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from individuals with ASD generate reduced metabolic activity when the amino acid tryptophan is the only available energy source, relative to typically developing (TD) controls. In a recent evaluation of 50 ASD and 50 TD cell lines from individuals aged 1 to 10, a classifier utilizing a Bootstrap aggregation approach based upon tryptophan and an expanded series of ions was able to properly classify individual cell lines with both a sensitivity and specificity of 92% relative to the clinical diagnosis. The classifier showed better performance in the younger age groups, particularly in individuals aged 1 to 3, which is also the ideal target range for a screening test for ASD. The development of a laboratory biomarker test based on these patented methods will potentially serve as a second tier objective test following initial behavioral observations have identified a child at risk of developing ASD, thereby providing for confirmation of the diagnosis and earlier treatment. Potentially, such a test will also (1) lead to a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this condition, (2) assist in the identification of biochemical signatures delineating ASD sub-groups, and (3) highlight novel targets for improved and individualized treatment approaches. Widespread use of the existing test methods, however, is currently limited either by the cost and time associated with generating immortalized cell lines for each sample or by the size of the fresh blood sample that can be acquired from children, which is necessary to obtain sufficient numbers of live cells for the metabolic profiling assay. Therefore, the objective of the proposed effort is to develop methods and technologies to perform metabolic profiling on immune cells from small volumes of fresh blood to enable a viable screening test for ASD. Efforts will first be focused on improving the sensitivity of the current live-cell metabolic profiling techniques. Miniaturization of the assay platform will then be implemented to reduce the number of cells needed for each test condition, thereby limiting the necessary blood sample volume. Blood samples from a minimum of 100 subjects diagnosed with ASD and 100 TD controls will undergo metabolic profiling in a blinded fashion according to the methods and protocols developed. The performance of multiple classifiers will then be evaluated to determine the ability of the techniques to identify individuals diagnosed with ASD. The successful completion of this effort will lead directly to the Phase 2 investigation, which will involve testing an expanded cohort, including other neurodevelopmental disorders, and finalizing the design of a commercially viable testing service, platform, or kit. Commercialization of the technology proposed will ultimately provide for a screening test to identify toddlers at increased risk for ASD, thereby providing for earlier diagnosis and improved behavioral outcomes."
"9462699","PROJECT 2 - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  As estimates predict that AD is likely to become one of the most important global public health issues by 2050, the urgency to develop mechanism-based disease modifying therapies for AD is ever increasing. Over the past two decades, animal model systems have been instrumental in clarifying the molecular mechanisms and testing therapeutic strategies for AD. Notwithstanding advances made using current rodent models that exhibit robust A amyloidosis and tau pathology, success in translating preclinical drug discoveries to the clinic remains rather disappointing. A major limitation of current mouse models is the lack of robust age-dependent neuronal loss induced by the interaction of amyloid and tau aggregates in their brains, salient neuropathological hallmarks of individuals with AD. To overcome this problem, we propose to characterize a recently created mouse model that not only exhibits A amyloidosis and tauopathy, but also displays robust age-dependent neuronal loss. We will use our new mouse model to test our overarching hypothesis that A? induces tau aggregation to initiate synaptic dysfunction and promote neuronal loss. We believe that such a model system will provide the opportunity for the first time to evaluate A? amyloidosis and tauopathy dependent loss of neurons as the principal outcome measure in preclinical testing of mechanism-based therapies, such as those designed to target tauopathy and/or A amyloidosis. Toward this goal, we recently generated lines of transgenic mice expressing human four-repeat tau fragment containing the ?K280 mutation (Tau-4R?K280) in the forebrain that not only developed AD-like tau aggregates but displayed memory deficits, age-dependent neuronal loss and brain atrophy. By crossbreeding Tau4R-?K280 mice with a model of A amyloidosis, APPswe;PS1?E9 mice, we generated mice that develop both Ab and tau pathologies (Tau608-AP mice). Significantly, both the tauopathy and cell death observed in Tau4R-?K280 mice were greatly accelerated in Tau608-AP mice, which support a model that the presence of A could accelerate the development of AD-like tau pathologies and age-dependent neuronal loss. Our proposal thus will allow us to focus attention on several important questions. First, it is not completely clear how accumulation of tau aggregations leads to neuronal loss. Second, it is not known whether and how A interacts with tau aggregates to promote the early pathological alterations that leads to synaptic dysfunction and accelerates neuronal loss. Finally, it remains an open question as to whether early interventions designed to target tau will attenuate neuronal loss in the presence of amyloid pathology in AD. In Project 2, we will use our novel mouse models to directly address these important questions. Our proposed studies will identify the mechanisms underlying the interactions between tau and A pathology, and provide valuable information to evaluate the effectiveness of targeting tau pathologies."
"9543682","Project Summary Intermediate filament (IF) proteins are encoded by ~65 functionally distinct genes, placing them among the 100 largest gene families in humans. The remarkable discoveries of hundreds of mutations in IF genes causing a plethora of human diseases have attracted the attention of basic scientists and physicians. The etiology and clinical manifestations of abnormal intermediate filament proteins are wide-ranging, including premature aging, cardiomyopathies, neurodegenerative disorders, myopathies and muscular dystrophies, as well as skin blistering diseases, amongst many others. Abnormal IF aggregates are now recognized factors in motor neuron diseases, Alzheimer?s disease, Parkinson?s disease and giant axonal neuropathy. The first therapeutic interventions based on this primary research are now benefiting patients, and it is therefore an exciting time and a new phase for the field. Furthermore, intermediate filament proteins, which serve as markers of the tissue origin of poorly differentiated tumors, as tumor markers in serum, and as a means of detecting micro-metastases, are now recognized as key initiating points in the metastatic cascade. The 2018 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) IF Meeting aims to unite researchers and clinicians who are contributing distinct perspectives and experience, but who together reveal insights relevant to intermediate filament biology, such as their structural and functional relationships to other established or emerging areas, including clinical medicine. Our objective is to promote a stimulating series of scientific sessions and an environment attractive to young investigators/trainees from diverse backgrounds while encouraging established scientists to embark on novel questions and deliver new therapeutic interventions. In addition to the use of human tissue and database resources, model systems represented will include Drosophila, Xenopus, zebrafish, C. elegans, and mouse. The approaches represented will include molecular/biochemical, cellular and structural/biophysical, genetic/developmental, grouped into nine sessions that represent the broad range of physiological and pathological processes in which IF proteins play a central role. The GRC IF meetings, which have been held continuously since 1990, bring together individuals that would not otherwise gather in a similarly intimate scientific forum. Thus, both established investigators and trainees look-forward to this opportunity once every two years. As represented in our speaker/chair list, we have been attentive to gender diversity, early-career investigators, and researchers new to the IF field. All applicants are invited to present posters describing their latest research; all of these will be at least briefly introduced orally. In addition, a number of platform presentations will be chosen from the submitted abstracts in order to ensure inclusion of the latest breakthroughs during the formal sessions. The attendance of young scientists has always been encouraged and in recognition of this, the meeting will include the fourth IF Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), which will precede the GRC and which will be organized by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows."
"9455712","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The classical approach to treat obesity, fatty liver and metabolic syndrome involves dietary calorie restriction, exercise, and, if necessary, bariatric surgery. Most diets focus on reducing energy intake, usually by restricting carbohydrates, proteins, and/or fat. Nutritional guidelines, such as the USDA MyPlate (food pyramid), focus on the caloric content of foods, such as proteins, grains, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. While most diets teach us how to count the calories we eat, rarely is weight loss sustained. It appears like something may be missing. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the non-caloric component of foods has an important, yet unrecognized, role in increasing the risk for obesity, fatty liver and insulin resistance. Based on our preliminary data, we propose that dietary salt, a noncaloric micronutrient present in many foods, has a role in influencing whether carbohydrates will act as simple caloric source or will initiate a metabolic system leading to fatty liver, insuln resistance, decreased leptin sensitivity, and weight gain. We hypothesize that the mechanism whereby dietary salt controls carbohydrate metabolic effects is mediated by its ability to hypertonically up-regulate and activate the aldose reductase-fructokinase system in liver, adipose tissue and brain. Aldose reductase up-regulation is mediated by the activation of the transcription factor associated to hypertonicity TonEBP/NFAT5 that stimulates the transcription of aldose reductase among other osmo-regulated genes. Activation of aldose reductase in these organs results in the generation of endogenous sorbitol and fructose from glucose. Metabolism of this endogenous fructose through fructokinase drives fat production and insulin resistance in the liver while inducing leptin release in adipose tissue and central decreased leptin sensitivity n the hypothalamus. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that salty foods raise hepatic and blood tonicity, thereby activating TonEBP, aldose reductase and the fructokinase pathway. This activation leads to endogenous fructose production, fat accumulation and insulin resistance. Also, we will study if this process occurs in animals when salt intake is provided under isoosmolar conditions. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that salt-induced metabolic syndrome (especially insulin resistance and fatty liver) can occur in isocaloric conditions. Also, we will tst if reduced central leptin sensitivity is an important step in the pathogenesis of salt-induced metabolic syndrome These studies may modify current views on the role of nutrition in obesity and metabolic syndrome, by revealing the importance of the non-caloric component of foods. While simple in concept, our studies could modify current scientific paradigms for nutrition and diet that could lead to changes in food labeling, nutrition and the dietary management of individuals who are overweight or obese."
"9457153","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a spectrum of liver pathologies from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; hepatic inflammation and fibrosis) and cirrhosis. NAFLD affects greater than 30% of the general US adult population, and disturbingly, prevalence rates of NAFLD and NASH appear to be greater in the military and veteran population. NASH is directly linked to increased liver-related, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality and also the need for liver transplantation. Previous studies from our group and others indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to NASH development and progression. Unfortunately, mechanism(s) that regulate hepatic mitochondrial function and increased susceptibility to NASH are largely unknown. Our group has recently demonstrated that normal endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation is lost in an obese rat model during the transition to NASH, and that systemic NOS inhibition causes hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and accelerates NAFLD progression to NASH. These studies form the overall hypothesis of this proposal, that hepatic eNOS and eNOS-derived nitric oxide (NO) are critical in maintaining normal hepatic mitochondrial function and quality control in the prevention of NASH. While it is well established that eNOS and NO regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma co-activator alpha (PGC-1?), a co-activator of nuclear transcriptional factors that control mitochondrial biogenesis, we have recently collected novel preliminary data that eNOS deficiency also causes a dramatic reduction nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (NRF2/NFE2L2) and in markers of hepatic autophagy and mitophagy, the cellular processes responsible for clearance of damage organelles and mitochondria. The loss of mitophagy in eNOS deficiency occur in conjunction with increased H2O2 emission, reduced anti-oxidative capacity, and susceptibility to western diet (high fat, sucrose, cholesterol) induced NASH. We will utilize dietary, pharmacological, and in vivo and in vitro molecular approaches (gain and loss of function studies) to mechanistically examine the novel links between hepatocellular eNOS and mitophagy in the development and progression of NASH. The specific aims will: (1) determine the role of hepatocellular eNOS in susceptibility to NASH, (2) test if targeting NRF2 and BNIP3 increases mitophagy and rescues NASH, and (3) test if upregulation in mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant defense alleviates western diet induced NASH. These studies will provide insight into reducing the incidence of NASH in our Veteran population."
"9457161","Osteoporosis (porous bone disease) is a disease of the skeleton that can have debilitating effects on many US veterans. An estimated 44 million Americans, or 55 percent of the people 50 years of age and older, are currently at risk for osteoporotic fracture. Improved treatment options for the disease require a greater under- standing of the cellular events and signaling pathways that control bone metabolism. My research program capitalizes on human diseases that result in very high bone mass. The genetic causes of these high bone mass diseases?craniotubular hyperostosis, sclerosteosis, van Buchem?s disease?provide insight into how bone mass can be manipulated in osteoporotic patients to improve their skeletal health and prevent fractures. Many of the high-bone-mass associated diseases are caused by mutations in a cell signaling pathway called ?Wnt.? Thus, manipulation of the Wnt pathway holds great promise for skeletal health improvement. This path- way is particularly attractive as a therapeutic target because it can be manipulated to increase new bone for- mation, rather than simply prevent further bone loss (which is how all but one of the currently available FDA- approved therapies work). The long term goals of my research program are twofold: first, we seek to under- stand how the secreted inhibitors of Wnt signaling function as a coordinated unit (i.e., a milieu), by adjusting their expression levels when other members of the unit are adjusted (e.g., inhibited or deleted). Those adjust- ments in expression in the members of the milieu represent prime targeting opportunities to enact large changes in anabolic action in bone, as our supporting data suggest. We also seek to understand how this Wnt inhibitor milieu controls the anabolic action of mechanical loading?a potent anabolic stimulus that has lasting benefits to the skeleton. We seek to understand whether certain members of the inhibitory milieu func- tion as ?homing signals? to ensure that new bone is added where it is needed most ? to the high strain regions of the bone, and that it is not added where it is not needed ? to the low strain regions of the bone. Again, our data suggest that the Wnt inhibitory milieu plays a significant role in this process. Our second goal is to con- duct functional studies targeting the Wnt inhibitor milieu, that have direct applicability to future therapeutic ap- proaches in patients. Bone wasting conditions such as mechanical disuse (e.g., bedrest, paralysis) and gluco- corticoid therapy (a drug used for treating inflammation and immunosuppression) are common among veter- ans. Based on measurements we and others have made regarding the changes in expression of Wnt inhibi- tors following disuse and glucocorticoid exposure, we hypothesize that the ?compensatory milieu? of four Wnt inhibitors?Sost, Dkk1, sFrp4, and Wise?coordinate via unknown mechanisms to prevent anabolic action in the presence of disuse glucocorticoid therapy. We are actively targeting the entire milieu in different combina- tions, to determine whether we can restore anabolic activity in mice exposed to these bone wasting condi- tions. If so, those approaches would have far-reaching implications for the design of therapies aimed at treat- ing veterans with disuse- and glucocorticoid-induced bone deficiencies. Another goal we have defined, which also capitalizes on the biology of the Wnt inhibitor milieu, is to determine whether we can reduce the dose/ volume of Sost antibody required to generate a significant anabolic response by additionally blocking acces- sory Wnt inhibitors that are part of the compensatory milieu. We have already shown that we can dramatically increase the anabolic efficacy of Dkk1 antibody if we use it in the presence of Sost inhibition. We anticipate a significant osteoanabolic effect using much lower doses of antibody if we simultaneously block other accesso- ry Wnt inhibitors. The overall research program described addresses these questions in order to identify new ways to improve bone health among the Veteran population, and among the public in general."

"9567497","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Dopamine release from neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) assists in learning goal-oriented behaviors and mediates the pleasurable aspects of most drugs of abuse. Understanding how the excitability of VTA neurons is regulated by synaptic inputs and membrane properties is crucial if one is to understand how dopamine release is controlled. 5'-Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master enzyme that regulates cellular metabolism. When activated by a falling AMP/ATP ratio, AMPK promotes biochemical pathways that increase energy production while reducing energy expenditure. Although AMPK is widely regarded as an energy sensor, recent studies suggest it also influences neuronal excitability. Preliminary data from our lab suggest that activators of AMPK potentiate the hyperpolarizing current evoked by ATP-sensitive K+ (K-ATP) channels, reduce the desensitization of dopamine D2 autoreceptors, and inhibit the influence of excitatory synaptic transmission in VTA neurons. The over-arching hypothesis of our proposed studies is that AMPK activation augments inhibitory influences on VTA neurons. Patch pipettes will be used to record whole-cell currents and potentials in single VTA neurons in slices of rat midbrain. Western immunoblot will be used to quantify levels of phosphorylated and total AMPK in midbrain slices that have been incubated in the presence and absence of AMPK activators and/or inhibitors. Aim #1 will characterize the effect of AMPK activators on currents evoked by the K-ATP opener diazoxide. Aim #2 will investigate second messenger systems and identify transmitter receptors that mediate the ability of AMPK activators to reduce dopamine D2 autoreceptor desensitization. Aim #3 will investigate mechanisms and sites of action by which AMPK inhibits glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission in the VTA. Aim #4 will characterize mechanisms by which AMPK activation inhibits burst firing in VTA dopamine neurons. Results of these studies may suggest new pharmacological strategies for treating dopamine-dependent disorders."
"9438373","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this research is to transform clinical care for patients with degenerative and traumatic bone pathologies. Despite recent advances in bone graft technology, a major void remains for orthopaedic surgeons who perform procedures that require bone healing. Current biologics on the market, such as recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2; INFUSE(tm)), are effective but are associated with adverse effects. Ceramics and demineralized bone matrices (DBM) are insufficiently effective as bone graft substitutes for spine fusion. Our goal is to develop an exogenous growth factor-free ceramic composite scaffold that is safe, easy to manipulate, and more effective at inducing bone formation and spine fusion than currently available products. To this end, our group has developed a unique 3D-printable hydroxyapatite (HA) ink that can be used to create a robust composite scaffold that not only promotes bone regeneration, but also has hyperelastic mechanical properties that improves functionality and delivery in both open and minimally invasive spine fusion procedures. This 3D-printed technology is easily scalable and facilitates incorporation of other bioactive factors or drugs, since ink synthesis, 3D-printing, and processing are carried out at ambient temperatures. In preliminary work, we developed a strategy to 3D-print a variation on this hyperelastic HA (hHA) that incorporates demineralized bone matrix (DBM) particles into the 3D-ink, which imparts an added osteoinductive stimulus from the native bioactive growth factors present within the DBM. The result is a flexible and elastic hHA-DBM composite that we believe is the basis for a highly effective bone graft substitute for both open and minimally invasive spine fusion procedures. With this proposal, we will 1) develop the optimal 3D-ink formulation and printing parameters for bone regeneration and evaluate the capacity of this hyperelastic bone composite (HBC) to elicit spine fusion in a rat spine fusion model; 2) compare its efficacy (bone regenerative and spine fusion capacities) with an established positive control (rhBMP-2; INFUSE(tm)); and 3) compare the mechanisms of pro-osteogenic action and inflammatory host response of the hyperelastic bone composite with that of rhBMP-2. We hypothesize that the resulting HBC will elicit comparable fusion rates and regenerative capacity to rhBMP-2, but will provoke a significantly lower inflammatory host response. This translational study aims to develop a technology that could modernize clinical care approaches, while advancing our understanding of the behavior and functionality of complex 3D-printed particle-based composites. Not only would this investigation lay the groundwork for a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective therapy for spinal arthrodesis, but the versatility of design and rapid rate of manufacturing would also allow for efficient customizabilit to individual patients. We expect that full development of this technology would transform clinical practice for patients with degenerative and traumatic conditions of the spine, and would ultimately translate to other orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic settings where bone regeneration is required."
"9471841","Project Summary/Abstract Current therapeutic options for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are limited, and new drug development in COPD has been hampered by the lack of clinically relevant biomarkers to assess likely drug efficacy. We will identify differentially abundant and lung-specific protein biomarkers of COPD in lung tissue and blood (plasma) using comprehensive proteomic analysis. Genetic determinants influence COPD susceptibility, but previously identified COPD genetic determinants account for only a small percentage of COPD heritability. Genetic analysis of protein biomarkers could reveal the network of regulatory factors influencing COPD susceptibility and COPD heterogeneity. Our overall hypothesis is that functional genetic variants lead to abnormal proteomic states that influence the development and heterogeneity of COPD. We will identify potential COPD biomarkers by studying lung-specific proteins that differ in lung tissue and plasma from 100 COPD cases and 50 smoking control subjects. We will then measure the most promising lung- specific plasma proteins in 1950 non-Hispanic White and African American COPDGene subjects with distinct imaging characteristics (airway-predominant COPD, emphysema-predominant COPD, and resistant smokers) to identify protein biomarkers associated with COPD and COPD subtypes. We will also perform genetic association analysis of lung-specific protein levels using whole genome sequencing data in these COPDGene subjects. Genetic determinants of protein biomarker levels will be tested for association with COPD susceptibility and COPD subtypes in multiple COPD populations. We will then determine whether the integrated analysis of the identified protein biomarkers of COPD susceptibility, several previously reported COPD protein biomarkers (CC16, Surfactant Protein D, sRAGE, and PARC), and the genetic determinants of COPD and COPD protein biomarkers enables prediction of disease progression rates in mild-to-moderate COPD subjects. The identification and characterization of novel COPD protein biomarkers may provide insights into COPD pathogenesis and tools for future clinical trials."
"9457151","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability in the USA, particularly so in veterans, who are disproportionately affected by aging and joint trauma. OA culminates in failure of the joint, which includes compromised cartilage chondrocyte differentiation and function, by mechanisms that are not completely understood. Because there is no disease-modifying medical therapy for OA, there is major unmet need to advance translation. Our long-term objective is to validate novel targets to limit OA cartilage failure, including processes that promote molecular innate inflammatory processes (inflamm-aging). A major obstacle in the field is that multiple homeostasis mechanisms are dysfunctional in OA chondrocytes, and we need to sort out which are the earliest, and central to the chondrocyte differentiation changes and viability loss. We have identified decreased mitochondrial mass, function, and biogenesis capacity in aging and OA knee chondrocytes, linked partly to deficiency of TFAM and other mitochondrial transcription factors. Our core hypothesis is that articular chondrocyte mitochondrial dysfunction is an early, pivotal, targetable, and reversible change in OA due to aging and biomechanical injury, and amplified by altered mitochondrial retrograde signaling. This includes decrease in the anti-inflammatory mitochondrial peptide humanin, causing effects on chondrocytes that we posit to be at least partly reversible in vitro using the humanin analog HNGF6A.  Effective control of injury- and aging-associated tissue degeneration requires not only biogenesis but also maintenance of healthy mitochondria. In the novel, testable OA pathogenesis model that we hypothesize, chondrocyte mitochondrial damage is perpetuated, in large part, by feed-forward and feedback loops involving compromise in cell surveillance mechanisms that normally assure mitochondrial quality control. We specifically hypothesize the failure of chondrocyte mitophagy, via not only deficiency of the mitophagy ?linchpin? BNIP3a, but also decreased proteasomal degradation of damaged polyubiquitinated outer mitochondrial membrane proteins, such as PINK1 and Parkin, by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), which is essential for mitophagy.  Our preliminary studies break substantial new ground by revealing markedly impaired UPS function in OA chondrocytes, including defective 20S proteasome core particle proteolytic activity, and accumulation of chondrocyte K48 polyubiquitinated proteins. We further identified that human knee OA chondrocytes have impaired assembly of the proteasome, a state that induces global outcomes of loss of chondrocytic differentiation, via diminished expression of the chondrocyte master transcription factor Sox9, and decreased matrix anabolic gene expression. For testing our integrative model of early, pivotal OA pathogenesis, innovation is applied by our bringing together of a particularly diverse investigative team, including collaborating experts in mitochondrial biology, autophagy and mitophagy, and in the UPS and profiling of cellular ubiquitylome signatures. We will employ our recently validated model of chondrocyte biomechanical injury, and carry out unique studies of human chondrocyte aging, via age-matched analyses of both normal and OA knee chondrocytes. Moreover, we address the problem of specifically testing the role of mitochondrial damage in OA of aging, by generating a chondrocyte-specific mouse model of TFAM knockout, which will be compared to normal mice in analyses for OA with aging in vivo. Completion of these studies will advance our long term goal of spurring translation in OA, by identifying novel OA chondrocyte biomarkers, and by pinpointing humanin and other novel, rational targets for potential development of medical disease-modifying OA therapies."
"9451244","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastomas are aggressive and invasive brain tumors that generally lead to death within a year of diagnosis.  No cure is available. Current treatments prolong life by only a few months, often at the expense of quality of life.  Here we test the general hypothesis that a novel recombinant chimeric virus will target and kill gliomas with no detectable adverse effect to the brain.  Of the large number of viruses we have tested, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) appears to be one of the most effective for targeting and destroying brain tumors.  However, VSV has the potential unwanted side effect of infecting neurons, and half of our efforts in the last few years have focused on reducing or controlling potential neurotoxicity of VSV.  To avoid complications and toxicity of the VSV G-protein, particularly its binding to neurons, we have compared a number of recombinant chimeric viruses in which the VSV G-protein gene was replaced by genes coding for binding glycoproteins of non-related viruses including rabies, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, Marburg, Ebola, and Lassa viruses.  Of these chimeric viruses tested, one stood out as a clear superlative safe oncolytic candidate: a chimeric virus consisting of a gene coding for the Lassa glycoprotein together with genes coding for the VSV N,P,M, and L proteins, and a GFP reporter gene which further attenuates the virus. Lassa-VSV is safe, both in rodents and primates. Of considerable importance, our direct injection of Lassa-VSV into the brains of normal mice or rats, or even into the brains of immunodeficient mice has not resulted in any detectable adverse effects, whereas injections of native or other attenuated VSVs generated neurological complications sometimes resulting in death.  Equally important, in our preliminary experiments in vitro and in vivo, Lassa-VSV targets and destroys gliomas completely without damage to the host brain, and extends survival of tumor-bearing mice indefinitely.  In the first set of experiments, we test the hypothess that Lassa-VSV successfully targets and kills glioblastoma cells that are transplanted into the brain, both after an intratumoral virus injection, and after intravenous inoculation. We use both glioma cell lines and primary human gliomas transplanted into immunodeficient mice. We also test syngeneic mouse glioma implanted into immunocompetent mouse host brains. Tumors are detected by expression of a red fluorescent reporter and virally infected cells are detected by expression of a reporter gene coding for green fluorescent protein. In the second Aim, we address the hypothesis that the mechanism behind the safety and selectivity of Lassa-VSV in the brain is that the virus either does not bind to receptors on neurons or normal glia, or is not internalized, whereas binding and internalization in glioma is robust. The lack of virus infection of neurons is studied by blocking or enhancing various steps in the infectious pathway coupled with reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR, and corroborated with electron microscopy, and in additional species and in human brain slices. A key hypothesis we test in Aim 3 is that Lassa-VSV initiates an attack by the systemic immune system, particularly by CD8+ T cells, on the glioma that continues even after the virus is eliminated, thereby preventing the recurrence of tumor. This is tested by infection of glioma in the brain; after the virus is eliminated, we examin the potential of newly implanted glioma to grow in the presence of the enhanced immune response. Immune targeting is complemented with adoptive transfer, CD8-T cell elimination, and immunocytochemistry to detect immune cells recruited to the infected tumor. Lassa-VSV is remarkable in that it can completely kill glioma with no detectable adverse side effects in the brain or elsewhere. If our experiments are successful, we think this virus would be a top priority candidate for clinical trials."
"9665218","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the relationship between central pain regulatory mechanisms, the clinical pain experience (clinical pain intensity, pain behaviors and interference) and treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with active disease. Chronic pain is a debilitating health problem, affectig over 116 million people. One of the most common causes of chronic pain is arthritis, affecting 22% of the adult population. Pain in RA, the most common systemic inflammatory arthritis, is historically thought to be due to joint inflammation. However, 70% of RA patients rate pain as their number one priority, despite treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and approximately one-third do not respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Compared to the general population, RA patients are more sensitive to pain in a widespread distribution, affecting joint and non-joint sites. These observations suggest that RA patients have altered central pain mechanisms. It is not known whether enhanced pain sensitivity, reflecting alterations in central mechanisms, predisposes RA patients to more intense clinical pain, beyond what is expected from joint inflammation. It is also not known whether these patients respond less well to DMARDs, which act on peripheral inflammation, compared with therapies that act on central pain mechanisms. The central hypothesis of this project is that alterations in central pain mechanisms are associated with heightened measures of clinical pain (pain intensity, pain behavior, pain interference) and poor DMARD response. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine the associations between central pain mechanisms and pain intensity, pain behaviors and pain interference among RA patients, and 2) evaluate the effects of central pain mechanisms on treatment response. The proposed study will follow 272 RA patients starting or switching DMARD therapy over 12 weeks. To assess overall central pain mechanisms, pressure pain thresholds (the amount of pressure that causes pain) will be measured at both joint and non-joint sites. In addition, two specific types of central pain mechanisms, the descending analgesic pathways and central sensitization, will be assessed. The descending analgesic pathways dampen pain signals extending from the brain to the spinal cord, whereas central sensitization is associated with heightened excitability of the central nervous system neurons transmitting pain. Descending analgesic mechanisms will be assessed using the paradigm of conditioned pain modulation, whereby a painful conditioning stimulus (cold pressor) is used to stimulate the analgesic pathways. Central sensitization will be assessed using the paradigm of temporal summation, whereby a noxious stimulus is given repeatedly, and pain ratings are assessed at the beginning and end of each series. We will examine the association between central pain mechanisms and the primary outcomes of pain intensity and treatment response. The results of this study will have an important positive impact by identifying mechanism-based targets for pain management in systemic inflammatory diseases."
"9425822","Summary  In this grant, we propose to perform gene expression analysis on peripheral blood cells (PBC) of auto-antibody negative first degree relatives of T1D patients (AA- FDRs) and AA+ FDRs who have either progressed (progressors) or not progressed to hyperglycemia (non- progressors), compared to healthy non-T1D related controls. We will also perform gene expression analysis on PBCs of patients enrolled in the TrialNet Abatacept (CTLA4-Ig) New Onset Study (TN-09). The proposed studies will confirm and extend our work on the identification of whole blood biomarkers of disease susceptibility and disease progression in T1D, and initiate our studies on biomarkers of response to therapy.  Preliminary data generated under funding from the JDRF suggests that the PBC gene expression profiles of T1D and T1D-related individuals are more similar to each other than to healthy normal non-diabetes-related controls; that is, there is a prodromal gene expression signature that can identify disease risk in the PBCs of AA- FDRs of T1D patients who show no clinical signs of disease. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that families of T1D patients, all have an environmentally-driven, epigenetically-controlled gene expression signature of risk that can be seen in peripheral blood. We identified a subset of AA- FDRs that had elevated levels of interferon-induced gene expression in their PBCs. These individuals also expressed a gene expression signature that was more similar to AA+ FDRs who progressed to hyperglycemia than to AA+ FDRs who did not progress, or to other AA- FDRs, and to controls, suggesting that whole blood gene expression biomarkers could be used to identify individuals who will progress to hyperglycemia prior to seroconversion. In patients who seroconverted (AA+), we found that gene expression was most changed during the early stages of disease (>3 years before the onset of hyperglycemia) in progressors compared to non-progressors. This indicates that we might be able to identify biomarkers that not only distinguish AA+ progressors from AA+ non-progressors, but also predict the rate of disease progression. Finally, studies have shown that PBC gene expression signatures differ in recent onset hyperglycemic patients that responded to anti-CD3 therapy compared to those who did not respond (AbATE trial). We hypothesize that we may also see a difference in gene expression in patients who respond to CTA4-Ig (Abatacept) compared to those who do not respond, 3 months after the initiation of therapy (TN-09). If non-responders could be identified early, this would allow time for other therapies to be tested before total loss of beta cell mass/function occurs.  Three specific aims are proposed. The first specific aim is to validate the prodromal gene expression pattern seen in diabetes related AA- individuals. The second specific aim is to identify both a PBC gene expression signature of T1D disease progression (identifying those who will progress to T1D from those who will not), and a signature of rate of progression. The third specific aim is to ask if there is a PBC gene expression signature that might predict responder vs. non-responder phenotypes for intervention with CTLA4-Ig in recent onset hyperglycemic patients using TN09 samples. The studies described in this application require PBC RNA samples from TrialNet. We have already received >300 samples from the TrialNet repository and have received provisional approval to receive additional samples (letter attached)."
"9666792","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent, chronic psychiatric disorder that imposes a major health burden, is associated with marked occupational and social dysfunction, and occurs with significant high degrees of psychiatric and medical comorbidity. Despite its prevalence and devastating impact, available treatments for PTSD have been found to be less effective for Veterans with PTSD. Evidence based pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy approaches have had modest success in improving symptoms and function in this population due to limitations both in terms of tolerability and maximal efficacy. Therefore, innovative interventions for the treatment of PTSD are sorely needed for Veterans with PTSD.  The application of non-invasive neuromodulation technologies is developing rapidly across neuropsychiatry. The availability of new devices, coupled with increased knowledge of underlying neurocircuitry relevant to psychiatric illness, sets the stage for economically advantageous and innovative clinical applications of technologies for PTSD treatment. There is an established body of literature that supports the efficacy of non-invasive neuromodulation for treatment of depression, although excitement for this approach for PTSD has been tempered by lengthy administration times and a paucity of data on whether changes in PTSD symptoms occur alongside changes in quality of life or social and occupational function.  The aim of the proposed research is to examine the potential of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) as an intervention for PTSD in Veterans. TBS holds particular promise for PTSD as can deliver a large number of stimulations rapidly, and its pattered delivery may particularly affect key brain regions  involved in PTSD. An important focus of this research is evaluating whether changes in quality of life and function vary with changes in PTSD symptom severity due to TBS. To this end, we propose to conduct a pilot study of 55 Veterans with PTSD randomized to receive either TBS or sham, with three Specific Aims: 1) determine the feasibility of recruitment and randomization, 2) determine the acceptability of TBS, and 3) to provide preliminary evidence of the effects of iTBS on changes in symptoms alongside functional outcomes.  This project will lay the groundwork in terms of feasibility, acceptability and methodology for a subsequent randomized controlled trial with adequate statistical power to test both the efficacy of adjunct TBS for PTSD and increasing quality of life for Veterans with PTSD. The longer-term significance of this project lies in the potential for implementing TBS for PTSD and its combination with psychotherapy, to create a powerful, individualized rehabilitation option for Veterans with PTSD."
"9478701","KL2 Project Summary/Abstract We propose our second generation institutional translational KL2 program at the University of Massachusetts Worcester Campus (UMW) that consists of the UMass Medical School (UMMS), the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS), and the Graduate School of Nursing (GSN). This program will build upon the transformative KL2 program that has produced 9 scholars with three graduates who together, have had an outstanding impact on our campus and patient care. This program will encompass the full spectrum of translational research from first-in-man studies to implementation science and global health with additional continuous feedback to our basic science colleagues. Working across the University of Massachusetts (UMass) system, we will leverage applied science, engineering, and manufacturing resources to foster a collective institutional culture of creativity and collaboration driving scientific inquiry across disciplinary boundaries. The nature of this proposal is transdisciplinary, a term we have adopted to describe a working environment that expands beyond discipline-based concepts, theories, and methods as a means to address a common research topic and promote team science. In this program, we aim to: 1. Promote a research career development program across basic, clinical, and population health  disciplines geared towards translating research into effective clinical practice and policy, as well as  generating new questions spanning the entire spectrum of research. 2. Recruit promising scholars resulting in a diverse scholar pool with respect to sociodemographic  characteristics, clinical background, and disciplinary perspective. 3. Provide scholars with the individual mentoring, academic career development, and technical skills  necessary to ensure their success as independent investigators as well as contributors to team science. 4. Provide an independence-targeted research experience within transdisciplinary teams that builds  on the strengths of the current environment of linkages between UMass campuses, departments,  centers, and institutes. In order to achieve these aims, each scholar will pursue a major research theme with guidance and direction from an experienced lead mentor and transdisciplinary mentorship team. Scholars will also pursue a degree or coursework to enhance their research potential, and undergo a novel high-impact journal internship that will position them to submit their results for publication in a practice-changing journal. Finally, scholars will produce an R01-level grant under the guidance of both their mentorship team and our newly created ?K to R Club? to position them for independence. Consistent with our transdisciplinary approach, our proposed program also includes mentor development that is built into our mentoring teams across the continuum of faculty levels and disciplinary perspectives. Thus, this program represents a UMass-wide effort for the next generation of our already transformative translational investigator career development program. Using these novel training paradigms and the plans laid out in this proposal, we will be able to meet the current and future needs of translational investigation in Central Massachusetts and beyond."
"9467548","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goals of the proposed research are to improve understanding of the pathogenesis of RNA splicing factor retinitis pigmentosa (RP) so that therapies can be developed for these blinding disorders. Mutations in genes that encode RNA splicing factors are the second most common cause of the dominant form of RP, and thus are an important cause of vision loss. The splicing factors affected, pre-mRNA processing factor (PRPF) 3, PRPF4, PRPF6, PRPF8, PRPF31, and SNRNP200 are highly conserved components of the spliceosome, the complex which excises introns from nascent RNA transcripts to generate mature mRNAs. Since RNA splicing is required in all cells, it is not clear how mutations in these ubiquitous proteins lead to retina-specific disease. Since all of the RNA splicing factors identified to harbor mutations that cause RP are associated with the U4/U6/U5 tri-snRNP complex of the spliceosome, it has been hypothesized that defects in RNA splicing underlie the RNA splicing factor forms of RP. What remains unclear is if specific aberrantly spliced transcripts cause the retinal disease, or if generalized alterations in splicing which occu globally affect the retina more than other organs. To investigate the mechanisms by which mutations in RNA splicing factors cause retinal degeneration, gene targeted Prpf3, Prpf8 and Prpf31 mutant mice were generated, and are being used to test the hypothesis that aberrant splicing underlies the retinal disease. In the past funding period cell autonomous defects in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell function were identified in the gene targeted mice. These are recapitulated in human ARPE-19 cells following knockdown PRPF31, suggesting that RPE cells are the primary target cell type in RNA splicing factor RP. RNA-seq analyses of the RPE from the three gene targeted mouse lines suggest that altered splicing of a limited number of transcripts underlies the defects in RPE function, and thus the retinal degenerative disease. In Aim 1 of the proposed research the effects of the identified altered transcripts on RPE cell function will be tested in cultured RPE cells and in the RPE in vivo to determine which of the altered transcripts could be responsible for disease. In Aim 2, these studies will be extended to human cells, since it is now possible to generate RPE cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and to introduce specific mutations into hiPSCs using genome editing tools. In Aim 3, the hypothesis that gene augmentation therapy can provide therapeutic benefit for PRPF31 disease will be tested. This is a logical extension of prior work, since mutations in PRPF31 have been shown to cause disease via haploinsufficiency, and RPE cells have been identified as the target cell type in RNA splicing factor RP. Viewed together, these Aims provide a logical pathway toward defining the pathogenesis of RNA splicing factor RP, and initiating work towards developing therapies for these forms of RP."
"9441744","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. More than 85% of lung cancers are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is defined by pathological characteristics. Oncogenic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain are found in a significant portion of NSCLC. Such mutations, which present most commonly as small in-frame deletions in exon 19 or as point mutations in exon 21, confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have enabled molecularly targeted therapy in this malignancy. By analyzing the tumors of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, we have identified two novel EGFR genomic alterations that have not previously been reported in lung cancer: EGFR kinase domain duplication (EGFR- KDD) and EGFR-RAD51 fusion. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of these newly discovered EGFR alterations in lung cancer. The EGFR-KDD is an intragenic rearrangement resulting in the tandem duplication of exons 18-25, the exons that encode the entire EGFR kinase domain. EGFR-RAD51 is the result of a chromosomal translocation encompassing EGFR exons 1-24, which includes all functional domains of EGFR except the C-terminal regulatory region, and RAD51 exons 4-10, which includes the ATPase and oligomerization domains, but not the DNA binding N-terminus. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that EGFR rearrangements, specifically the EGFR-KDD and EGFR-RAD51, are recurrent, oncogenic, and therapeutically targetable alterations in lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out experiments to 1) identify the best strateg to therapeutically inhibit EGFR-KDD; to 2) determine whether EGFR-RAD51 is oncogenic and sensitive to EGFR-targeted agents; and to 3) determine the frequency of EGFR-KDD and EGFR-RAD51 in non-small cell lung cancer. Collectively, the proposed research uses in vitro and in vivo models as well as patient-derived data to address a previously unrecognized potential mechanism of oncogenesis in lung cancer: EGFR rearrangements. Importantly, understanding the consequences of these EGFR alterations may provide insights into EGFR biology and reveal new uses for FDA approved agents. As such, these studies are expected to have rapid translation into the clinic. Finally, as a physician-scientist-in-training who aims to have a career as a translational cancer researcher, the proposed studies provide an exciting and fertile training avenue."
"9565867","Recent FDA approvals of ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab, which target checkpoint receptors cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1), have ushered in a new era of cancer immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma. Despite unprecedented overall survival benefits with combination therapy, the incidence of complete responses are only 12-22%, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are increased, and the cost of treatment is approaching $275,000 per patient per year. As such, cost-effective approaches to improve the safety and effectiveness of checkpoint blockade for not only metastatic melanoma, but also for more genetically stable solid tumors are needed. Cell adhesion integrins VLA-4 and LFA-1 are required for efficient antigen presentation, trafficking, and tumoricidal activity of effector cells. These integrin receptors are clinically validated therapeutic targets in autoimmune disease; inhibitors such as natalizumab decrease T-cell activation and migration. Conversely, we have discovered small molecule integrin agonists, eg, 7HP349, that may increase the efficiency of the immune response against solid tumors. This approach could be particularly useful when combined with immune checkpoint blockade. Completed phase I studies have demonstrated that 7HP349 can significantly enhance the anti-tumor activity of anti-CTLA- 4, anti-PD-1, and anti-4-1BB antibodies in animal models of melanoma and carcinoma. Toxicity studies have demonstrated the compound to be safe, even when administered at doses up to 80-fold higher that it?s therapeutic dose. Based on this success, our current phase II effort is centered around in vivo testing of oral administration of 7HP349 in the B16-BL6 melanoma model, mechanistic studies to guide biomarker development, including the effects of 7HP349 on T effector cell biodistribution (Specifc Aim 1), GLP IND- enabling studies of toxicity in rodent and non-rodent species, including radiolabeled ADME (Specific Aim 2), and an iterative synthetic chemistry approach to further optimize drug like characteristics of our lead candidate 7HP349 (Specific Aim 3). All work proposed will be consistent with FDA guidelines outlined in ?Guidance for Industry: S9 Nonclinical evaluation of anticancer pharmaceuticals.?"
"9505234","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Medication is an efficacious treatment strategy for adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Chan et al. 2016), however use significantly declines during adolescence when the consequences of ADHD are most severe (e.g. dropping out of school, delinquency, etc.). The Unified Theory of Behavior Change (UTBC) (Fishbein et al. 2001) has been proposed as a conceptual model to explain the mechanism underlying ADHD medication adherence and to guide the development of interventions to improve the continuity of treatment (Chacko et al. 2010). The UTBC is a well-established and empirically tested model that identifies factors that influence an individual?s intention to perform a behavior as well as factors that influence whether a behavior is actually carried out. Indeed, our preliminary data support the relevance of pre- intention factors and implementation factors for medication continuity among adolescents with ADHD. Currently, no evidence-based interventions target medication continuity for adolescents with ADHD. Our research team is well positioned to create an intervention that addresses each of the main UTBC factors influencing the intention and implementation of regular medicine taking. Such an intervention would transform care for adolescents with ADHD and help prevent the alarming fall-off in effect size from medication efficacy studies to effectiveness in real world practice caused by poor adherence. The overall objective of this application is to develop and test a multi-component intervention that systematically identifies and targets aspects of the UTBC model most relevant for each adolescent with poor ADHD medication continuity. Our central hypothesis is that our tailored intervention will support ADHD medication continuity. We will objectively test our central hypothesis by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) Design, build, and optimize the usability of web-based intervention components to support medication continuity among adolescents with ADHD using an iterative stakeholder-centered design approach involving all stakeholders (i.e., adolescents, parents, and pediatricians) in all stages of development, and 2) Conduct a 12-month stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial among adolescents with poor medication continuity to test whether the intervention engages the mechanism underlying medication continuity and improves outcomes. Preliminary data generated from this project will be used to support a future R01 application to test the intervention in a larger stepped wedge cluster RCT that is powered to detect differences accounting for clustering within practices and to formally assess moderators and mediators of outcomes."
"9674006","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 5 year career development plan for Dr. Pallavi Gopal to serve as a transition to successful independent physician-scientist. Dr. Gopal completed her clinical training in Anatomic Pathology and Neuropathology at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), and is now developing an independent research and training program that will allow her to gain expertise in spatial and temporal dynamics of mRNA transport under physiological conditions and in disease. This proposal brings together diverse resources in RNA metabolism, molecular neuroscience and neuropathology and will provide superb training for Dr. Gopal to develop into an independent physician-scientist. Research will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Erika Holzbaur, an internationally recognized expert in microtubule-based motors and real-time axon transport dynamics. This grant will provide protected time for Dr. Gopal to gain expertise in neuronal cytoskeletal, organelle, and RNA-protein dynamics through formal coursework, scientific seminars and meetings. The collaborative environment at Penn will foster utilization of novel techniques to conduct the proposed project and will provide Dr. Gopal with the training required to proceed towards a successful academic career.  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and front temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) exist on two ends of a clinic pathologic spectrum but share clinical, genetic, and pathologic features. Ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions composed of Tran's active response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) are a shared feature of sporadic ALS and the most common form of FTLD; there is concomitant loss of normal nuclear TDP-43 expression. Moreover, the discovery of disease-linked mutations in TDP-43 and other RNA processing proteins highlights altered RNA metabolism as a common pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration. However, our knowledge of how TDP-43 mislocalization disrupts its nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA processing functions and/or mediates toxicity in the cytoplasm is still incomplete. The research plan will utilize innovative approaches with real-time imaging techniques in primary neurons to test two main hypotheses: that loss of nuclear TDP-43 results in reduced dynamic flux of TDP-43 target mRNA and proteins in axons and that cytoplasmic redistribution of TDP-43 under pathological conditions results in mislocalization of TDP-43- associated mRNA. The specific aims are to: 1) Determine whether loss of nuclear TDP-43 function reduces axonal trafficking of synaptic proteins and organelle turn over and 2) Determine how (A) loss of cytoplasmic TDP-43 RNA binding function and (B) stress-induced cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregation affect localization and trafficking of mRNA in axons and dendrites. These studies will provide temporal and spatial resolution of individual RNA transcripts in neurons in order to gain a clearer understanding of altered RNA metabolism in ALS/FTLD pathogenesis."
"9458115","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Award will provide additional training and practical experience for the candidate, Dr. Jennifer Barton. Dr. Barton is a rheumatologist who practices at a public hospital and has developed a research agenda around patient-clinician communication and health disparities. To further develop her career and achieve the goals of her research plan, Dr. Barton requires additional training in three areas: 1) qualitative research methods, 2) collaboration with measurement experts, health IT, and communication experts in development of a patient-reported tool, and 3) advanced biostatistical methods.  Dr. Barton has assembled a multidisciplinary team to assure her success in achieving the goals of this award. Specifically, her primary mentor Dr. Edward Yelin, an expert in health services research in the rheumatic diseases, and co-mentor, Dr. Dean Schillinger, an internationally recognized expert in health communication with extensive expertise in implementing interventions among vulnerable populations, are uniquely situated to oversee Dr. Barton's training plan and execution of the research strategy. Dr. Patricia Katz, an expert in measurement science at UCSF; Dr. Victor Montori, a Mayo Clinic investigator and expert in the design of tools to share knowledge in the clinical encounter; Dr. Liana Fraenkel, a rheumatologist and health services researcher with extensive experience in patient preference and decision making; Dr. Somnath Saha, OHSU researcher in health communication and racial disparities in chronic disease; and Dr. Stuart Gansky, a UCSF biostatistician with experience analyzing data from observational studies of diverse populations, will provide support, expertise, and unique perspectives to Dr. Barton.  Despite advances in treatment options and strategies for rheumatoid arthritis, significant disparities in outcomes among ethnic minorities and non-English speakers persist. Effective patient-clinician communication is central to the diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and avoidance of unsafe use or misuse of costly, potentially toxic therapies. Despite the need for a trusting partnership between patient and doctor to manage RA, goal- setting remains an unexplored domain, especially among patients who face barriers to communication. Therefore, in Aim 1, Dr. Barton will develop a measure of patient-clinician goal concordance; assess the extent and predictors of goal concordance using a mixed methods approach. In Aim 2, Dr. Barton will evaluate whether goal concordance is associated with trust, RA self-efficacy, quality of life, and medication adherence. In Aim 3, she will develop and pilot-test an intervention to enhance the elicitation of patient goals and conduct a larger, randomized trial of the intervention. This project will deepen our understanding of goal concordance in RA, as well as provide necessary training and practical experience to ensure Dr. Barton's success as an independent clinical investigator, and provide the basis of an RO1-application to evaluate an intervention to improve patient-clinician communication and quality of care in RA."
"9495160","Cell Penetration Profiling for Biotherapeutics Biotechnology promises the ability to control biology and disease with laser-like precision. Hundreds of peptides, proteins and nucleic acids are being developed as diagnostics and therapies, but nearly all of these have poor cell penetration and unpredictable subcellular localization. Currently, there are no quantitative, high- throughput tools to measure how much of a biomolecule enters a cell and where it distributes within the cell. The imprecision and low throughput of current methods for measuring intracellular delivery is a major barrier for the development of biomolecule therapies. The Kritzer lab has devised a new method for quantitating cell penetration, called the ChloroAlkane Penetration Assay (CAPA). CAPA measures the degree to which a molecule penetrates the cytosol, independent of the molecule's target or biological function. Our published and unpublished data show that CAPA is quantitative, inexpensive and high-throughput, and that it exclusively measures penetration to single cellular compartment. Based on these results, we envision that CAPA could be used for comprehensive cell penetration profiling for a large variety of biomolecules and drug delivery systems. This will provide detailed data on dose dependence, time course, penetration to different subcellular compartments, and cell type specificity. It will also allow independent profiling of endocytic uptake, endosomal escape and nuclear import. We propose applying cell penetration profiling to uncover structure-activity relationships for cell penetration for several classes of bioactive peptides, cell-penetrant proteins, and antisense oligonucleotides. Finally, we use cell penetration profiling to understand and improve the delivery of Cas9-sgRNA complexes by lipid nanoparticles. Our understanding of how all these classes of biotherapeutics reach the cell interior is severely limited by current methods. Cell penetration profiling provides a rapid means of measuring endocytic uptake, endosomal escape, and nuclear import, allowing critical drug delivery problems to be directly assessed and avoided. Since intra-cellular delivery is the major hurdle for most biotherapeutics, cell penetration profiling has the potential to become a routine and valuable part of the development process for peptide, protein and nucleic acid therapies."
"9525081","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains a devastating fibrotic parenchymal lung disease with high morbidity and mortality, for which there are no effective therapies. Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to identify molecular pathways that are targetable for therapeutic intervention. This proposal seeks to address this unmet need by investigating the role of TNF- in the resolution of pulmonary fibrosis using the well- characterized bleomycin model in mice. In preliminary studies we have shown that the intratracheal administration of TNF- at the peak of the bleomycin-induced fibrotic response accelerates resolution and that mice with a genetic TNF- deficiency have impaired resolution of fibrosis. These and other considerations have led us to hypothesize that TNF- plays an integral role in the resolution of pulmonary fibrosis through effects on macrophages and myofibroblasts. We hypothesize that TNF- alters the phenotype of both of these cell populations reducing their pro-fibrogenic phenotype and allowing them to aid in the resolution process. Specific aim 1 will address the hypothesis that TNF- induces a switch in macrophage programming from alternative to classical, reducing the production of pro-fibrotic mediators including TGF- and IGF-I, increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-) and enhancing matrix metalloproteinase production to initiate tissue remodeling and the restoration of normal pulmonary architecture. The goal of specific aim 2 is to address the hypothesis that TNF- promotes myofibroblast apoptosis in a two-step process, first by directing myofibroblasts de-differentiation to fibroblasts, and second by sensitizing these fibroblasts to undergo Fas- mediated apoptosis. Finally, specific aim 3 will translate our work into human disease using IPF-derived myofibroblasts and a humanized mouse model of fibrosis. Our proposed studies represent the first time TNF- has been investigated as a key player in the resolution process of pulmonary fibrosis. It also represents a novel opportunity to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of IPF. Thus, a long-term goal of this proposal is to translate our anticipated findings into the development of therapies for patients diagnosed with fibrotic lung diseases, including IPF."
"9418093","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nucleus tractus solitarii (nTS) is the first central termination and integration site for sensory reflexes, including the carotid body chemoreflex that is augmented during chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The glutamatergic synapse between the primary afferent and second-order nTS neuron is highly modifiable, expressing multiple forms of synaptic plasticity and enhanced by CIH. This nTS synapse is closely associated with astrocytes (glia) that actively contribute to synaptic and neuronal activity and plasticity through the release of gliotransmitters and by uptake of neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft. The interaction among glia, presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic neurons is referred to as the tripartite synapse. Several gliotransmitters have been identified, including glutamate and ATP. Astrocytes in the nTS release glutamate in response to afferent sensory input to modify neuronal activity. Uptake of afferent and network released glutamate and GABA by their respective transporters is critical for shaping and synchronizing activity, and preventing excitotoxicity. Glia modify synaptic transmission in response to acute hypoxia, and prolonged hypoxia alter the expression and/or function of components of the tripartite synapse, and likely glia-neural communication. The role of astrocytes, gliotransmitters and their role in neurotransmitter uptake in synaptic plasticity in normoxia, let alone its enhancement in CIH, is unknown. Moreover, how astrocyte-mediated effects on synaptic plasticity augment cardiorespiratory reflexes is unknown. Our central hypothesis is glial transporters basally restrain synaptic activity, but increased activation of astrocytes within the tripartite synapse enhances synaptic and neuronal function to augment the cardiorespiratory system. CIH enhances nTS neurotransmission and hypoxic cardiorespiratory responses due to elevated astrocyte activity and excitatory GT release, and altered balance of Glu and GABA uptake. Aim 1 will define the magnitude by which nTS (a) neuronal and synaptic function, and their plasticity, are modulated by astrocytes and influenced by gliotransmitters, (b) astrocytes are activated by neuronal activity, (c) tripartite synapses modulate respiration, sympathetic nerve activity and their coupling, and (d) excitability is augmented in CIH due to astrocyte activation. Aim 2 will determine the magnitude by which astrocyte Glu or GABA transporters (a) influence nTS neuronal function, (b) activate synaptic and extra-synaptic receptors, (c) regulate cardiorespiratory function, and (d) are altered by or contribute to CIH-induced augmentation of nTS neurotransmission. This study presents an integrative approach to exploring important basic and clinical questions, including the recording of neurons and astrocytes, imaging, molecular biology, optogenetics, DREADD manipulation and in vivo physiology. Understanding the circuits, and their glia-neural- interactions, involved in cardiorespiratory diseases will advance our understanding of its development and potentially lead to its treatment."

"9462748","PROJECT 2 - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Insulin resistance (IR) and central obesity at midlife are associated with cognitive decline and greater risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Converging evidence suggests amyloid and neural injury mediate this effect. Yet, the impact of IR and central obesity on the brain remains poorly understood in humans, especially at the preclinical stage of the disease. The objective of Project 2 is to determine the effect of IR and central obesity on longitudinal brain and cognitive change in people at risk for AD. Our overall hypothesis is that central obesity and IR affect multiple pathways which ultimately contribute to a critical burden of neural pathology manifesting as cognitive decline. Our hypothesis is based on our own pilot data (presented herein) showing that central obesity and IR affect amyloid deposition, gray matter atrophy, glucose metabolism, and memory function. To carry out our objective and test our hypothesis, we propose 3 Specific Aims: 1) Determine the extent to which IR and central obesity are linked with midlife beta amyloid, 2) determine the effect of IR and central obesity on neural health in late-midlife, and 3) determine the mediating effect of amyloid and neural injury on memory function. We will achieve these aims by enrolling 100 participants from the Wisconsin ADRC IMPACT cohort into Project 2. The IMPACT cohort is an asymptomatic group of middle-aged adults enriched on risk for AD. We will utilize existing data and samples, in addition to prospectively collected MRI (T1- weighted), CSF (to be assayed for P-Tau, A?42, sAPP-?, and insulin) cognitive, laboratory and clinical data; culminating in at least three time points. Half of the participants in Project 2 will be enrolled into a PET sub- study and will undergo [F18]FDG-PET, and [F18]Florbetapir imaging at two time points. Following completion of this study, we will have a) determined the extent to which IR and central obesity affect the ?-secretase pathway of APP cleavage, and longitudinal amyloid deposition, b) determined the effect of IR and central obesity on longitudinal brain amyloidosis as indexed by [F18]Florbetapir, c) determined the effect of IR and central obesity on structural neural injury and glucose uptake, d) determined whether glucose hypometabolism is due to neural injury or central hypoinsulinemia, and e) determined the extent to which amyloid and neural injury mediate the relationship between IR, central obesity, and hippocampal-based memory decline. The proposed research is fully integrated with the resources and expertise at the Wisconsin ADRC. This project depends on the Clinical Core (IMPACT cohort) and the Neuropathology Core (fluid sample management), and will utilize other resources including services provided by the Neuroimaging Core and the Data Management and Statistics Core. Synergy with the Wisconsin ADRC ensures the strong feasibility of the proposed research. The metabolic abnormalities to be studied in Project 2 affect more than half of all older adults, while also being established AD risk factors that have the potential to be modified.

"9613900","This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive ?neuro-psychometric? characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders."
"9269316","Abstract:  Triple-negafive (TN) (tumors that do not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), or HER2) and HER2-overexpressing (H2E) (tumors that are ER-/HER2+) breast cancers are two particularly aggressive molecular subtypes of breast cancer that disproportionately impact Hispanic women and other medically disadvantaged populations. However, factors influencing their etiologies and prognoses are largely unknown, and none of the few studies assessing these questions have included a meaningful number of Hispanic cases. To address this existing research gap, we propose a population-based case-case study of breast cancer among women aged 20-69 years in the Seattle, Washington and Albuquerque, New Mexico greater metropolitan areas. This study will include 1120 TN, 600 H2E, and 1120 luminal (ER+) invasive breast cancer cases, including 175 TN, 90 H2E, and 175 luminal cases that are Hispanic. Detailed medical record reviews will be conducted to ascertain data on numerous breast cancer risk factors. With a sample size that is  substantially larger than any other published study of these tumor types, a focus on the age range over which these tumors are most common, and inclusion of a substanfial number of Hispanic cases, this study will enable us to address the following new quesfions:  1. How are established breast cancer risk factors, including reproductive factors, anthropometric  measures, mammographic density, and family history of breast cancer, related to risks of TN and  H2E breast cancer relative to risk of luminal breast cancer? Several studies with limited sample sizes indicate that TN, H2E and luminal breast cancers have different risk factor proflles, but these results require confirmation in a larger population-based setfing. Given that most breast cancer risk factors confer elevated risks of breast cancer independent of race/ethnicity, identifying TN and H2E specific risk factors could have broad public health importance and provide important insight Into the contributors to the higher incidence rates of these two aggressive types of breast cancer that both Hispanics and African Americans experience.  2. Do the associations between established risk factors and risks of TN and H2E breast cancer differ  among Hispanics and non-Hispanics? While most risk factors are unlikely to difl'er in their associafion with TN and H2E by Hispanic ethinicity, there is some data to suggest that some, like family history, might A strength of our study is the incorporation of genetic ancestry when defining women as Hispanic.  3. How do established breast cancer risk factors influence risk of mortality among women diagnosed  with TN and H2E breast cancers? Several epidemiologic risk factors, notably obesity, influence risk of mortality among breast cancer survivors. However, no prior studies have assessed how such risk factors may differentially impact risk of mortality among TN and H2E breast cancer survivors."
"9551495","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Breast cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases in women. According to American Cancer Society about 230,480 women in the US were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2011 and about 40,000 died in that year. Also, a 2009 study by the Walter Reed Army Med. Ctr. suggested that women in the army are 20-40% more likely to develop breast cancer. Therefore, a greater understanding of breast cancer and better therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. This proposal focuses on the fork-head box transcription factor FoxM1 that is over-expressed in the aggressive forms of breast cancers, including the Basal type(s) of breast cancer. Moreover, over-expression of FoxM1 coincides with metastasis and is a biomarker for poor prognosis. In this proposal, we plan to evaluate the functions of FoxM1 in normal mammary gland as well as in the mechanisms that lead to the development of aggressive breast cancer. In addition, we will determine whether targeting FoxM1 using a specific peptide-inhibitor inhibits metastatic progression of breast cancer. The proposal is based on a newly discovered function of FoxM1 in repression of GATA-3 in mammary gland. FoxM1 is expressed at a high level in the luminal progenitor cells. GATA-3 induces differentiation of those progenitors. We will test the hypothesis that FoxM1 controls excessive differentiation during pregnancy, and thus plays an important role in maintaining plasticity of the mammary gland. GATA-3 also is a suppressor of metastasis in breast cancer. Therefore, we will investigate the hypothesis that the repression function of is critical to the mechanism by which FoxM1 contributes to the development of highly aggressive breast cancer. We have characterized a highly specific peptide inhibitor of FoxM1 derived from the tumor suppressor p19ARF that in a cell- penetrating form (ARF-peptide) inhibits metastatic colonization of liver cancer, p53-null sarcoma and p53-null lymphoma. We will investigate whether that peptide-inhibitor efficiently blocks metastatic progression and/or sensitizes breast cancers to available therapies, such as Taxol. The specific aims are:  Aim1: Investigate the roles of FoxM1 in mammary gland.  Aim2: Investigate the roles of FoxM1 in the metastatic progression of breast cancer.  Aim3: Investigate whether the ARF-derived peptide inhibitor of FoxM1 inhibits mammary  tumor progression. This merit review proposal is in response to BLR&D RFA on Women's Health. As more women are entering the US Army, health care at the VA with regards to invasive breast cancer is becoming increasingly significant. Our studies will investigate several novel hypotheses, which will be insightful in understanding and in therapy of metastatic breast cancers."
"9543878","Summary/Abstract The 2018 FASEB Summer Research Conference on Ubiquitin and Cellular Regulation will be held at Snowmass, Colorado, June 17 to 22, 2018. The FASEB-sponsored conference has been held biannually since 1989; this application seeks support for the 2018 conference. The conference will bring together approximately 150 investigators (junior and senior scientists, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and people from industry and government) for discussions of recent advances in the area of regulated proteolysis, with special emphasis on human diseases. Protein ubiquitination cuts across all fields of biology and the diversity of its impacts cannot be overstated. The selective degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin system is a mechanism for control of virtually all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology, including the cell cycle, transcription, metabolic pathways, development, and antigen processing. In addition, non-proteolytic functions of u b i q u i t i n a t i o n in protein trafficking and signaling are critical for processes that involve membrane receptors and signaling in the innate immune system, while others help to coordinate the DNA damage response. Dysfunction of the system is involved in many disease processes, particularly c a n c e r , neurologic and developmental diseases, and viral and microbial infectious diseases. In addition, ubiquitin- like proteins (also covered in this conference) are critical in infectious diseases, and it is now evident that microbes encode ubiquitin-like proteins, that bacteria and viruses produce enzymes to modulate and/or emulate cellular ubiquitination pathways in host cells, and that cells defend themselves against infectious agents with specific ubiquitin-like proteins. The topics of nine scientific sessions will be: (i) Mechanism of Ubiquitin Conjugation & Deconjugation; (ii) Ubiquitin Conjugation & Deconjugation structural biology; (iii) Proteasome and p97; (iv) UBL conjugation and deconjugation; (v) Protein quality control; (vi) Organelles and Trafficking; (vii) Ubiquitin Recognition and Signaling; (viii) Disease Pathology and Therapy; (ix) Stem Cells and Development. In addition, there will be four poster sessions. This conference will be a timely and important meeting in the area that is still rapidly growing. This conference is fairly unique in that it provides a format that brings together an extraordinary range of investigators whose collective approaches encompass cell biological, biochemical, molecular and genetic methods that address central issues in the regulation of cellular proliferation. The FASEB SRC format provides a unique environment that encourages informal and open discussions among the participants and this in turn fosters initiation of collaborative efforts and stimulates future research directions to broaden the understanding of the roles of ubiquitin, the proteasome, and ubiquitin-like proteins in health and disease."

Whole organ bioengineering offers a potential solution to these problems by removing all immunogenic and infectious material from donated human or animal lungs, and seeding the remaining scaffold with cells derived from the proposed recipient. This decell/recell strategy has been investigated in many different organs across many different labs, but due to the unique nature of the lung (the fragile alveoli and air- filled bronchi), techniques developed for other organs are not well-suited for the lung. Many of these techniques circulate decellularization reagents using fairly high pressures which may damage the delicate alveolar structure similar to the clinical entity known as ventilator associated lung injury. These techniques also rely on aqueous cell suspensions for recellularization. This poses numerous difficulties in the airways. Due to the size, shape, and single opening of airways, cells settle to the dependent areas and become trapped in the small airways rather than adhering to the large airways. Additionally, bronchial cells require exposure to an air liquid interface to properly proliferate and mature. Finally, there is growing evidence suggesting that airflow patterns within the airways are important determinants of lung health but few techniques exist to investigate these flow patterns and it is not known what influence decellularization, or transplant will have on these airflows let alone the impact of the anastomosing animal lungs to human airways in xenotransplant. In this proposal, I aim to investigate new decellularization and recellularization techniques which better approximate normal physiology. This will be accomplished through three specific aims 1) Determine if negative pressure ventilation is less injurious to pulmonary tissue during decellularization and if gas ventilation improves cell proliferation and maturation during recellularization. 2) Determine optimal characteristics of a novel cell sprayer device to apply cells to the airways. 3) Evaluate a new technique to assess airflow patterns within the airways."
"9442797","Project Summary / Abstract Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of disorders that affects about 1 in 4,000 people. In most cases patients have night blindness, and mid-peripheral followed by far peripheral vision loss, then a contracting central visual field (VF; extent of vision), tunnel vision and eventual blindness. There are no treatments and current management aims to slow progression and to provide rehabilitation. Potential interventions to restore vision include artificial retinal implants and other visual prostheses, gene therapy, and stem cells. While these interventions tend to focus on restoration of central vision, consideration should be given to providing peripheral vision. For those not at end-stage disease, enhancement of peripheral vision could provide benefit by assisting with functional ability and perhaps by slowing disease progress. Further, the requirements of peripheral vision are more consistent with the quality of vision that is available from current and near-future interventions.  A main purpose of peripheral vision is locomotion, providing information about the environment for safe mobility. Patients with RP often have peripheral islands of vision, which are regions in the far periphery on either side and often below. Clinical experience suggests that these peripheral islands are valuable for mobility. However, there have been no published studies that examine the value of peripheral islands. Before providing peripheral vision through some form of vision restoration, the value of peripheral islands should be evaluated.  We will use a very large set of existing data from over 600 patients with RP who participated in one of five to seven studies. Their responses to one or more of three vision function questionnaires will be merged using Rasch analysis into a single linear scale that will measure functional ability. Their measured visual fields will be analyzed using a novel archetypal analysis approach. This approach decomposes visual fields into fundamental elements and patterns from which peripheral islands can be quantified. The primary aim of the study will be to determine the impact of the presence of peripheral islands on functional ability. We will employ two approaches to this analysis, firstly using mixed-effects regression and, secondly, using an established Bayesian variable selection approach.  This project is a collaboration between Russell Woods and Tobias Elze at the Schepens Eye Research Institute, Michael Sandberg at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and Konrad Pesudovs at Flinders University."
"9552675","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Opioids are a mainstay of treatment for acute and chronic pain. Unfortunately, chronic opioid use is highly problematic in large part due to the loss of treatment effect over time and the need to escalate doses. Strong preliminary and published evidence suggests that pain signaling and opioid effects converge on BDNF expression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to accelerate tolerance, paradoxically enhance pain and worsen functional outcomes after acute injuries including surgery and when treating chronic disease. Epigenetic effects appear to play a prominent role. The main objective of these studies is to understand how spinal input through pain pathways and chronic opioid administration interact to heighten pain sensitivity, increase opioid requirements and worsen functional outcomes after injury.  The goal of the first aim is to determine how opioid exposure and surgical trauma work individually and together to regulate spinal Bdnf expression, and to define the functional consequences of that expression. We hypothesize that surgical incision and chronic opioid administration in mice converge to cause the up- regulation of Bdnf in spinal cord neurons thus enhancing the severity of opioid maladaptations and pain. Pain-related signaling involving the activation of spinal NK1 receptors by the primary afferent neurotransmitter substance P (SP) and opioid effects involving -opioid receptors (-OR) will be examined specifically using knockout mice and selective pharmacological agents. Expression studies measuring Bdnf mRNA and protein will be integrated with immunohistochemical approaches carefully identifying the cellular source(s) of BDNF in our mouse model. Additional pharmacological studies will examine the functional roles of the high affinity TrkB and low affinity p75 receptors in mediating BDNF's effects in spinal cord tissue. We expect to observe that neuronal up-regulation of Bdnf and activation of TrkB receptors contribute to multiple indices of pain after incision, functional changes in gait, tolerance and OIH.  The goal of the second aim is to determine the role of epigenetics in the regulation of spinal Bdnf expression after opioid exposure, surgical trauma and the combination of circumstances. We hypothesize that the pain-related neurotransmitter SP and morphine individually and together enhance the neuronal expression of Bdnf in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons in vivo via an epigenetic mechanism. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays will be used to follow changes in the association of acetylated H3K9 and/or H4K12 histone protein with the Bdnf promoter. Immunohistochemical studies will identify the cell types within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where histone acetylation and Bdnf up-regulation are occurring. Pharmacological studies will be used to demonstrate the functional role of alterations in histone acetylation with respect to Bdnf up-regulation and worsened opioid maladaptations and pain after incision. Additional mechanism-oriented studies will examine the role of the pCREB-CBP/p300 pathway in mediating the effects of SP and morphine on histone acetylation. We expect to find that the SP and morphine pathways converge on the phosphorylation of CREB thus activating CBP/p300-mediated histone acetylation at the H3K9 or H4K12 positions near the Bdnf promoter.  The proposed studies pursue the novel hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for clinically important adverse interactions between pain and the chronic use of opioids. In doing so we expect to identify new approaches to the treatment of pain and methods to enhance the effectiveness of our most powerful but problematic class of pain relievers. The team assembled to pursue these aims possesses expertise in all required technical aspects of the project and has the scientific and clinical experience to place the anticipated results in thei proper perspective."
"9458238","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HL-131. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. It is also strongly influenced by cigarette smoking (CS) and genetic predisposition. A novel gene, FAM13A (family with sequence similarity 13, member A, with unknown function) has been consistently associated with susceptibility to COPD in case-control studies and with lung function in general population samples in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Very recently, the COPD risk allele at the FAM13A locus was shown to be associated with increased expression of FAM13A in human lung samples. However, how this novel gene functions in vivo under CS-induced injury remains unknown. This substantial gap in our knowledge has greatly impeded translation of these genetic discoveries into a better understanding of COPD pathobiology and the huge potential of personalized medicine. Using a series of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that Fam13a-deficient mice (Fam13a-/-) showed attenuated emphysema induced by either CS or elastase. We also make the first connection between the novel GWAS gene FAM13A and the canonical Wnt pathway, essential for lung development as well as lung repair/regeneration in a variety of pulmonary diseases. In vitro, Fam13a facilitates assembly of protein phosphatase 2A(PP2A) with -catenin and promotes the phosphorylation and degradation of -catenin. Herein, we propose to extend our studies to a deep and comprehensive dissection of the regulation of the Wnt pathway by Fam13a and how their cross-talk mediates lung repair during CS-induced injury. In Aim 1, we will utilize a sensitive and specific GFP reporter mouse line for Wnt pathway activation to characterize the temporal and spatial regulation of Fam13a on the activity of the Wnt pathway during CS- exposure. In Aim 2, we will fully characterize how Fam13a modulates lung regeneration through inhibiting the Wnt pathway in the CS-induced injury model. In Aim 2.1,we will generate a double-deficient (Fam13a and - catenin) mouse line specifically in SP-C(surfactant protein C)-positive cells, facultative progenitor cells for lung reair after injury and then expose these mice to CS to determine whether activation of the Wnt pathway led to resistance to CS-induced airspace enlargement in Fam13a-/- mice. Roles of SP-C-positive cells in lung regeneration after CS-induced injury will be further explored in Aim 2.2. We will trace-label SPC-positive cells with GFP after tamoxifen induction in the presence or absence of Fam13a in vivo, then expose mice to acute and chronic CS to determine the role of the Fam13-Wnt axis in lung regeneration mediated by SPC-positive cells. In Aim 3, we will apply human primary alveolar and airway epithelial cells from COPD subjects with known genotypes at the FAM13A locus to determine whether differential cell proliferation and differentiation correlate with varying beta-catenin levels associated with FAM13A genotypes. Upon completion of this project, we will have a much deeper understanding of the role of Fam13a--catenin/Wnt pathway during CS-induced injury and the mechanisms underlying human COPD."
"9465403","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Candidate: Dr. Robert Kotloski is a staff neurologist in the Epilepsy Center of Excellence and in the Traumatic Brain Injury/Polytrauma (TBI) clinics at the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital. He is also a research fellow and instructor in the Department of Neurology at the University of Wisconsin. Dr. Kotloski has completed a combined MD/PhD degree at Duke University School of Medicine, during which time he studied molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis. He has completed a residency in Neurology at Wake Forest University and a Clinical Neurophysiology fellowship with an epilepsy focus at the University of Wisconsin. He is applying for a VA CDA-2 award in order to obtain the career development training and support for scientific study to become an independent VA researcher.  Environment: Dr. Kotloski will complete the proposed research at the VA and the University of Wisconsin. Both organizations provide an exceptionally collegial atmosphere and strong institutional support including protected time, research space, and equipment. The unique strains of in-bred rats are only available through the laboratory of a mentor, Dr. Thomas Sutula, and have not been used for TBI research previously.  Career Plan: Dr. Kotloski's long-term career goals include the establishment of an independent, productive research laboratory focused on understanding TBI, post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), and its comorbidities. Through his mentors, he will enhance his knowledge of animal models of epilepsy and TBI including cellular (Dr. Rutecki) and network (Dr. Sutula) mechanisms of epilepsy, and molecular mechanisms of TBI (Dr. Vemuganti). During the course of this proposal, he will hone his skills in manuscript and grant writing, mentoring, presentation, and laboratory management. Dr. Kotloski expects the proposed research and training will allow him to independently compete for VA Merit Review funding prior to the end of the CDA-2 award.  Research Project: Current understanding of devastating residuals of TBI such as epilepsy is limited by a paucity of useful animal models. However a unique, plasticity-susceptible strain of rat, selected for increased rate of kindling, has demonstrated frequent post-traumatic seizures following moderate-to-severe TBI. The immediate goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that, following a traumatic brain injury, the development of epilepsy is preceded by changes in electrophysiologic activity and protein expression which are predictive of the later occurrence of PTE. Aim 1 is to characterize spontaneous electrographic changes and post-traumatic seizures after TBI in unique rat strains and out-bred rats. Two complementary strains of in-bred rats, one selected for increased rate of kindling (plasticity-susceptible) and another selected for decreased rate of kindling (plasticity-resistant), as well as out-bred Sprague-Dawley rats, will be studied. TBI will be induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) and electrophysiologic activity will be recorded from the time of injury through the development of PTE. The goal of this aim is to identify changes in electrophysiologic activity following TBI and prior to the appearance of seizures, which would advance our understanding of this critical but clinically silent period, and which could serve as biomarkers for post-traumatic epileptogenesis. Aim 2 is to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying post-traumatic epileptogenesis. Protein expression patterns from the brains of rats from the three genetic backgrounds at various time points following the CCI will be correlated to the presence or absence of PTE. Molecules known to be involved in the response to TBI and in epileptogenesis, including BDNF, TrkB, Tau, A?, and GFAP, will be studied. The goal of this aim is to identify molecular mechanisms and brain structures underlying the development of PTE, which could guide the development of potential therapeutics. As TBI and PTE impact a significant number of Veterans and civilians, and current diagnostic and therapeutic options are severely limited, improved understanding of this prevalent and challenging disorder will greatly advance our ability to care for these individuals."
"9553354","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Despite the recent advances in the clinical management, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains 2nd leading cause of the cancer-related deaths in Veteran armed forces personnel. Each year Veterans affairs manage and treat ~175,000 CRC-patients and cancer progression remains the principal cause of CRC-associated death. Thus, need for therapies that can prevent CRC progression remains urgent.  This proposal exploits a key clinical observation by us and other groups that expression of claudin-2, a tight junction (TJ) protein, is highly upregulated in CRC, promotes colon tumorigenesis in vivo and protects from cell death induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. However, despite the proven ability of claudin-2 to promote CRC, underlying mechanisms as well as therapeutic potential of claudin-2 remain unexplored. Importantly, among claudins expressed in colon, claudin-2 is uniquely expressed only among the undifferentiated colonocytes at crypt bottom, the proliferative zone, and promotes colonic epithelial cell (CEC) proliferation, in vitro and in vivo. Notably, claudin-2 is a transcriptional target of Wnt-signaling. Further, tissue microenvironment regulates colonic claudin-2 expression in EGFR-dependent manner. The EGFR- and Wnt-signaling regulate colonic stem cell niche and accordingly we have found upregulated expression of Lgr-5, Olf4 and CD-133, stem cell markers in cells or mice overexpressing claudin-2 versus respective controls. In CRC, a proliferative phenotype associates with dedifferentiation. In accordance, claudin-2 expression decreases with the differentiation in CRC-cells and resists differentiation when overexpressed. In addition, our preliminary studies suggest that claudin-2 may help protect CECs from stress-induced death by regulating autophagy. Our additional data using Villin-claudin-2 transgenic mice suggest that constitutive claudin-2 expression renders immune-suppression. Notably, immune suppressive conditions help promote tumor progression. Taken together, we hypothesize that claudin-2 expression promotes colon tumorigenesis by facilitating stem cell expansion and plasticity, resistance to cell death and modulation of the host-tumor immune interaction. To test our hypothesis, we propose following specific aims: Aim-1) to determine how claudin-2 regulates colon tumor growth and tumor cell plasticity. Here, we will determine: A) the role of claudin-2 in the regulation of colonocyte differentiation, stem cell niche and tumor cell plasticity; B) whether claudin-2 promotes autophagy to promote tumor cell survival and chemoresistance; and C) whether claudin-2 expression modulates host-tumor immune interaction to promote tumor progression; and Aim-2) to determine the role of EGFR- and Wnt-signaling in the regulation of colonic claudin-2 expression and therapeutic potential. Here, we will determine: A) the role of EGFR-dependent signaling, transcriptional mechanism/s and potential cross-talk with Wnt/?-catenin signaling in the regulation of claudin-2 expression; and B role of claudin-2 as a CRC-biomarker in conjunction with EGFR and Wnt-signaling. Our short term goal is to better understand how dysregulation of claudin-2 expression modulates the ability of colon cancer cells to form tumor and further progression. Our long term goal is to develop strategies to inhibit claudin-2 expression applicable specifically to the colon cancer cell and thus to create an anti-CRC drug that can prevent disease progression. We believe such therapeutic interventions can significantly increase survival and quality of life US Veterans who are suffering from colorectal cancer."

"9472306","This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids (HA) that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for HAs, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based on individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one?s ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely can result in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change HA service delivery models yet can be implemented within existing business models and in concert with current practitioners. The ISPS method effectively replaces target-based HA fitting (e.g. NAL-NL2) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. The proposed work follows successful completion of our pilot project and builds upon the research team?s prior research on novel fitting methods for cochlear implant (CI) devices recently acquired by Cochlear, Ltd. Following the successful implementation of ISPS and integration with commercial HA software in the pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility including a field study in which performance outcomes for the ISPS method were as good as a conventional HA fitting method and only took a fraction of the time, despite ISPS having no prior knowledge of patient characteristics and no audiogram. Successful maturation and commercialization of the ISPS technology in Phase II will address several barriers identified in the previous RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure, and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting HAs), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs), and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to HA fitting for patients who tend to avoid professional help). This Phase II project will develop an operational ISPS method by (1) integrating ISPS with hardware/software systems of our industry partners, (2) refine and enhance the ISPS method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of fitting hearing instruments, (3) build support for the use of ISPS in multiple marketplaces, and (4) evaluate the technology through field trials in different service delivery environments by comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase III project will focus on the transition of the technology to support remote and self-fitting of hearing instruments."

"9462667","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is largely incurable disease characterized by a narrowing of the small pulmonary arteries and arterioles that progressively worsens, causing substantial loss of quality of life, and significant long-term morbidity and mortality. There are 5 classes of PH recognized by the WHO, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, Class 1.1) and hypoxemia-induced PH (Class 3) for which our data implicate NOTCH3 in the vascular smooth muscle (vSMC) pathogenesis of both of these types of disease. Specifically, NOTCH3 mediates two fundamental manifestations of PH: hyperproliferation of small pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and the excessive store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) induced by hypoxia that underlie vascular remodeling and vasoconstrictive disease phenotypes, respectively. To advance the hypothesis that NOTCH inhibition would be therapeutic, we developed highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of the interaction between NOTCH and its transcriptional effector RBPJ. A logical next step is to test the new NOTCH inhibitors for the ability to reverse PH symptoms using animal models in vivo and in primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells derived from the human small pulmonary arteries and arterioles in vitro. Recognizing that no single animal model reproduces the human condition, including gender selectivity and pathogenesis, we will use three rodent models that present the vasoconstrictive and hyperproliferative cellular phenotypes we postulate are regulated by NOTCH/RBPJ. The Specific Aims are: 1) Develop selective small molecule inhibitors of NOTCH:RBPJ to probe function in PH 2) Test whether the novel inhibitors block PH phenotypes using patient-derived small pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (sPASMCs). 3) Evaluate whether inhibiting RBPJ reverses PH vasculopathy in animal models. In summary, this multi-PI/PD proposal builds on our complementary expertise to test the hypothesis that pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH/RBPJ can be used to successfully treat PH, which is a challenging and often incurable disease. The project is highly significant since it targets a pathway that appears to underlie pathology in multiple forms of PH. It is highly innovative since it advances the development of a new generation of selective small molecule inhibitors of NOTCH to treat PH."
"9480804","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Cancer Cell Biology (CCB) Program of Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University is a laboratory-based translational program focused on understanding the changes in function of human cells as a result of cell transformation. Deregulation of the intra- and extra-cellular functional interactions of the cell's proteome leads to abnormal cell phenotypes, and these processes are at the root of the cancer process. The research within the CCB Program is organized into three scientific themes: (1) Cell Survival and Death Mechanisms, which focuses on intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of cell death through understanding and targeting both the Bcl-2 family and of death receptors; (2) Tumor?Stroma Interactions, which seeks to understand how tumor cells communicate and adhere, the biology of cancer stem cells, angiogenesis and immune interactions, and the process of EMT that is important for cell motility, invasion, and metastasis; and (3) Cancer Cell Metabolism, which focuses on how genetic alterations affecting signaling pathways impact the posttranslational modifications of key metabolic enzymes and redirect metabolic intermediates toward the synthesis of biomolecules of cell growth and proliferation. Under the leadership of Erwin Van Meir, PhD (leader) and Lawrence Boise, PhD (co-leader) the CCB Program has 36 core members from 16 different departments in the School of Medicine or Emory College.

"9473085","PROJECT SUMMARY: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death globally, and in the US, where one-quarter of COPD occurs in non-smokers. Non-smokers represent 50% of the US population over 50 years old, but have been excluded from major COPD studies. In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Lung Study, we recently demonstrated that variant airway anatomy was common and associated with higher COPD prevalence. Findings were consistent among smokers and non- smokers but underpowered in the latter group. The current application would define the clinical significance of variant airway anatomy among non-smokers for COPD and respiratory symptoms, and for incident COPD and lung function decline over 10 years. Hypothesis 1: Variant airway anatomy is independently associated with COPD and respiratory symptoms cross-sectionally among 2,635 non-smokers and with incident COPD and decline in lung function among 2,000 non-smokers followed for a median of 10 years. Preliminary computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling suggests that variant airway anatomy may alter airway resistance and particulate matter transit to the distal airways. Additional pilot work suggests that these proximal airway variants may be markers of altered airway branching through the lung, suggesting a global increase in airway resistance with the variant applying to non-smokers. The current application would test if these mechanisms apply differentially to non-smokers and smokers to facilitate personalization of risk and care for COPD. Hypothesis 2: Mechanisms of COPD risk differ by common airway variant among non-smokers and smokers: 2a The accessory segmental airway variant, which is associated with increased risk among non- smokers, reduces regional airflow in a CFD model of participant-specific geometry, whereas the absent segmental airway variant, associated with increased risk among smokers, increases particulate transfer to the distal lung. 2b The accessory segmental airway variant is associated with globally altered airway branching, whereas the absent segmental airway variant represents lobe-specific altered airway branching. Airway anatomy has developmental origins and may provide a refined phenotype (compared to lung function) for genetic investigation. Preliminary analysis by the PI identified genetic variants in fibroblast growth factor 10, a gene implicated in airway development, to be associated with variant airway anatomy. The proposed study will increase the sample size 5-fold to perform the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of variant human airway anatomy, with replication in an independent sample. Hypothesis 3: GWAS will discover genetic variants underlying the common airway variants, with replication in an independent sample. The current application represents the largest structure-function evaluation of COPD among non-smokers; and will test developmental and biological hypotheses to identify novel preventative and therapeutic strategies for this understudied but majority subgroup of the US population."
"9497476","Preliminary work indicates the mTOR-binding protein DEPTOR is a potential molecular target for therapy in multiple myeloma. It is specifically upregulated in this disease and its silencing is lethal to myeloma cells. We, thus, identified a potential DEPTOR inhibitor in a high-throughput drug screen. The inhibitor is effective in myeloma cells with the expected molecular alterations and induction of death. In this proposal we plan to further develop this inhibitor. We will generate biochemical derivatives with the aim of enhancing the therapeutic index of DEPTOR inhibitors, identify the mechanism of action of where the inhibitors first bind in myeloma cells, ascertain possible toxicity to normal tissues in mice with deleted DEPTOR expression and assess possible interactions with other anti-myeloma therapeutics that are used in the clinic. We will also test the effect of DEPTOR on flux through the pentose phosphate shunt. Our expectation is that these new drugs will be important additions to the armamentarium used in myeloma patients and, furthermore, they will be specifically tailored to patients with tumors that have high DEPTOR expression."
"9442788","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly. It has a significant impact on the independence, quality of life, and healthcare costs for those afflicted and the additional social cost on caregivers and family members is incalculable. There is substantial variability in the AMD phenotype and the primary treatment, to repeatedly inject anti-VEGF antibodies into the eye of those severely affected, is effective in only a subset of individuals. Thus a better understanding of the underlying causes of AMD is needed to help guide development of more universal and effective treatments and potential preventive measures for AMD. AMD is strongly influenced by genomic variation. Through the initial funding period of this proposal, we supported the development of the International AMD Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC), which brought together 26 research groups from around the world. The IAMDGC has increased the known genomic loci from 12 to 52 and successfully performed a new and larger genotyping study focused on rarer variation using a high-density genome-wide SNP chip with exome content. This collaborative effort has also spawned numerous additional interesting avenues of research that we now need to explore in more detail through the renewal of this highly successful project. While the current genotypic dataset of over 50,000 samples has much left to be mined, expansion of the available samples, with a particular focus on families and minority samples, is necessary if we are to achieve our stated goal of completely defining the genetic architecture of AMD. To address these unresolved issues we propose four specific aims: 1) Expand the IAMDGC resource with additional datasets and expansion of current datasets, with a focus on family data and diverse genetic ancestry; 2) Expand the range of clinical diagnostic measures (e.g. fundus photos, OCT measures), biomarker, comorbidity, and covariate data associated with the samples; 3) Use an analytical hub infrastructure to perform detailed analyses of these data; and 4) Support the logistics and administration of the IAMDGC."

We recently identified a novel target molecule that contributes to the development of T1D. Hyaluronan (HA) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) polymer that is abundant in islets under autoimmune attack. HA polarizes local immune responses towards a pro-inflammatory Th1 T-cell phenotype and prevents induction of pro- tolerogenic, Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Treg), thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of T1D.  We have also identified a compound that may prevent T1D. 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) is an oral inhibitor of HA synthesis, which clears islet HA deposits and prevents diabetes in multiple animal models of T1D, including in DORmO and Non Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice. These effects are associated with an increase in pro-tolerogenic, Foxp3+ Tregs and prevention of ? cell destruction. Our data suggest that it may be possible to prevent T1D in humans by targeting HA synthesis with 4-MU, our lead compound.  These results are particularly exciting because 4-MU is already an approved drug. Called ?hymecromone?, it has been prescribed for >40 years to treat biliary spasm. It is safe, well-tolerated, approved in children as well as adults, and could be an ideal oral agent to prevent progression to T1D.  Unfortunately, 4-MU has poor pharmacokinetics that precludes its clinical use for T1D prevention. In particular, oral 4-MU has low bioavailability. Consequently, large doses of 4-MU are required in our animal models. Administration of comparable regimens is impractical in humans, such that it is not possible to repurpose 4-MU for human T1D prevention. We need an improved version of 4-MU with better bioavailability.  A pro-drug strategy is often used to improve the bioavailability of phenolic compounds like 4-MU, our prototype lead compound. In proof of principle studies we have generated a 4-MU pro-drug which delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes, demonstrating that this approach is feasible and pharmacologically sound.  Along with these efforts to improve upon the bioavailability of 4-MU, we also need to understand what tissue levels of 4-MU are required to effectively target islet HA synthesis. Further, we need to define the relationship between oral 4-MU dosage and islet 4-MU exposure.  Here, we propose a systematic framework for the pharmacologic evaluation of 4-MU, for the generation of 4-MU pro-drugs, and for their functional assessment in well-validated and predictive animal models of autoimmune diabetes. Together, these early-stage, pre-clinical studies will establish the mechanistic and pharmacologic foundations necessary to for ADME studies in humans and a human phase I clinical trial."
"9543290","ABSTRACT: PROJECT 1 This project will develop and evaluate a comprehensive and integrated suite of analytical, computational, and bioassay based approaches for assessing overall reductions in toxicity resulting from bioremediation of Superfund (SF) sites. These tools will then be applied to optimize biodegradation of two contaminant mixtures, triazine herbicides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons representative of environmental exposures faced by our community partners the Yurok Tribe, through systematic investigation of carbon sources, electron acceptors, and reactor detention times. Although both of these contaminant mixtures are known to biodegrade, transformation products (TPs) accumulate and are widely found in groundwater (triazines) and/or have increased toxicity compared to parent compounds (PAHs). Bioreactor performance will be characterized by measuring shifts in microbial community composition, bioassay activity, and both target and nontarget chemical concentrations measured with GC and LC high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). This combination of measurements will provide unique insights into interactions among contaminant transformations, microbial populations and overall reductions in human and ecosystem risks. Novel enzyme engineering approaches will be used to identify rate limiting steps in triazine mineralization and to isolate or design improved enzymes to carry out these steps. Microorganisms with improved ability to degrade triazines will be prepared and tested in the bioreactors to assess ability to remove target compounds and to reduce overall bioactivity compared to standard enrichment approaches. Our central hypothesis is that chemical hazard reduction during SF site remediation can be best characterized through broad consideration of both contaminant destruction and byproduct formation. We further hypothesize that a minimum suite of high- throughput assays can be defined to effectively capture the overall risk reduction during remediation and that this suite of assays can guide optimization of bioreactor design and operation. This project will support a paradigm shift in the SRP away from reducing concentrations of specific constituents and toward the overall reduction of deleterious biological effects. The project is strongly integrated with the overall program, drawing on HRMS, metabolomics, and statistical expertise in the Analytical Core, the full range of bioassays available in the Bioanalytical Core, immunoassays from Project 3 especially for triazines and TPs, as well as integrative bioassays for ER and oxidative stress being developed by Projects 4 and 5. The bioassay suite developed here will be used to analyze environmental samples collected through the Community Engagement Core and the overall workflow will be transferred to a broader user community with the assistance of the Research Translation Core."
"9636818","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), an injury or concussion associated with brief loss of consciousness or altered mental state, has affected as many as 35% of soldiers wounded during recent military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Up to 30% of those injured report persistent somatic, emotional and cognitive post- concussive symptoms (PCS) which may adversely impact family life and community re-integration. Marital conflict and intimate partner violence, reported by 54% of OEF/OIF couples, and co-occurring mental health problems may exacerbate cognitive dysfunction and delay rehabilitation. A key contributor to marital conflict is a lack of knowledge about the Veteran's condition and the skills needed to help him compensate for common deficits in memory and planning which create challenges in household management. Despite a growing evidence base for couples treatment for PTSD, there is no established family-based treatment for OEF/OIF Veterans with mTBI, creating a critical research and services gap. The proposed research aims to fill this gap by evaluating a novel form of multi-family group treatment designed to improve community integration (CI) among married/cohabiting OEF/OIF Veterans with mTBI by training spouse/partners to aid with rehabilitation and employing disability-adapted communication and problem-solving skills to reduce marital conflict and improve marital satisfaction. Veterans (N=180) with a positive DVBIC screen for mTBI sustained during the OEF/OIF era, confirmed by the VA Identification Clinical Interview and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score e 19 will be randomized to receive either: 1) Multifamily Group for TBI for Couples (MFG-mTBI- C), a psychoeducational, rehabilitation and skills-building intervention consisting of a 2-session multifamily educational workshop providing information about TBI and 12 bi-monthly multifamily group meetings providing skills training in problem-solving and communication related to cognitive/emotional deficits; or 2) 14 bi-monthly multifamily group sessions delivering health education without skills training. Both treatments will be preceded by 2-3 individual couples sessions. Participants will be assessed pre- and post-treatment and 6 months post- treatment. Data will be analyzed using an intent-to-treat analysis with paired comparisons between treatment groups on primary (Veteran CI, caregiver burden) and secondary (anger management, use of social supports) outcome variables using mixed effects regression models. It is hypothesized that: 1) Veterans treated with MFG-mTBI-C will show improved CI, anger management and use of social support, and spouse/partners will show reduced burden compared with those treated in the health education group; 2) that improvement in CI will be mediated by improvement in marital satisfaction and Veteran anger management and social support; 3) that Veterans with more intact cognitive functioning at baseline will show greater improvement in CI, anger management, social support and marital satisfaction. If efficacious, MFG-mTBI-C has the potential to assist Veterans with mTBI and their partners throughout the VA Health Care System."
"9548155","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Helicobacter pylori is the dominant member of the gastric microbiota in a majority of the world's population. H. pylori colonization can lead to protection from some pro-inflammatory diseases such as allergic airway disease, but also can lead to significant detrimental outcomes, including gastritis, peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Infection with H. pylori is the single most common ris factor of gastric cancer; for this reason, H. pylori was defined by the World Health Organization as a Class I carcinogen. Current data suggest that, in addition to bacterial virulence factors, the magnitude and types of immune responses influence the outcome of colonization. The long-term chronic pro-inflammatory response to H. pylori is believed to drive or initiate the pathways which lead to the adverse outcomes of colonization including chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer.  We have accumulated preliminary data that strongly implicate interleukin-21 (IL-21), a cytokine produced by many subsets of activated CD4+ T cells, as a critical driver of adverse consequences of H. pylori colonization and infection. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how many pro-inflammatory molecules lead to these detrimental outcomes. The major goal of this application is to investigate the mechanisms by which IL-21 regulates the immune response to H. pylori, by primarily utilizing mouse models that focus on the primary detrimental outcome of infection, gastritis. A second goal is to determine the impact of IL-17 and IL-21 immunotherapies on gastritis. Moreover, organoids and human biopsies will be used to investigate IL-21 activated pathways at various steps along the gastric precancerous cascade. In this proposal, the specific aims are designed to elucidate the mechanism by which IL-21 modulates both immune and non- immune cell responses. Our central hypothesis is that IL-21 is a master regulator of the inflammatory response during H. pylori infection, thereby driving detrimental outcomes (such as gastritis). The Specific Aims are: 1. To investigate the mechanisms by which IL-21 regulates pro-inflammatory T cell priming and activation during H. pylori infection. 2. To determine the contributions of IL-21 in dendritic cell function during H. pylori infection. 3. To elucidate the contribution of IL-21-mediated epithelial cell responses to control of gastritis and H. pylori colonization.  This research will also inform  myriad of other infectious and chronic inflammatory disorders for which IL-21 is increasingly recognized to play a central role. Defining mechanisms through which H. pylori induces gastric cancer may provide important insights into other malignancies that arise from inflammatory foci. Moreover, the proposed studies will generate new insights into the fundamental mechanisms involved in the development of chronic inflammation."
"9472887","PROJECT SUMMARY The interaction between Hsp70s and cellular membranes is a new and largely uncharacterized function of these indispensable molecular chaperones. We hypothesize that the interaction between Hsp70s and lipids is a critical step for their membrane-associated functions, and that lipid-binding provides them with the necessary specificity to localize and function at different membranes during cellular stress and disease conditions like cancer. The interaction of Hsp70s with lipids suppresses tumor growth, induces cell death, activates the immune system, stabilizes membranes, and regulates nutrient recycling (microautophagy). This interaction depends on the lipid environment, is mediated by multiple types of molecular forces, and is altered by nucleotide binding. Furthermore, Hsp70s are differentiated with respect to their lipid-binding function. However, the conditions under which Hsp70s interact with lipids in human cells and the amino acid residues responsible for binding remain mostly unknown. To answer these two fundamental questions we propose two specific aims. First, we will determine the conditions that favor the interaction of HspA1A, the stress-inducible Hsp70 in humans, with lipids. For this task we will use several human cell lines, which will be subjected to different treatments that alter membrane lipid composition. The interaction of HspA1A with lipids will be assessed using pull-down assays, cellular imaging in the presence or absence of known lipid-binding proteins and fluorescent lipids, subcellular fractionation, and cell surface biotinylation. Furthermore, a targeted lipidomics approach will be used to authenticate HspA1A native lipid ligands. Second, we will identify and characterize the amino acids that mediate the HspA1A-lipid binding, and elucidate the molecular mechanism of this interaction. For this task, several amino acids, which will be predicted using computational techniques and observations from the literature, will be mutated. The mutational effect on the binding of recombinant HspA1A to lipids will be quantified using the liposome sedimentation method and Surface Plasmon Resonance spectroscopy. Additionally, the mutational effect on HspA1A function and stability will be determined by assessing alterations of the chaperone function. Finally, the mutational effect on the lipid-binding properties of HspA1A will be verified in human cells using fluorescently labeled HspA1A and a combination of pull-down assays, imaging, and subcellular fractionation. This proposal will provide fundamental knowledge that will allow us to test the effects of loss-of-function mutations in human cells and identify their physiological implications. If validated by these experiments, our lipid-binding specificity hypothesis will allow us to further elucidate this novel property of Hsp70s, which has critical associations with the cellular stress response, membrane biology, and disease conditions like cancer. Furthermore, this project will train multiple non-traditional and first-generation undergraduate and master level students, and will prepare them to enter companies, research labs, and advanced academic programs."

"9462844","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have disproportionately high rates of obesity and related morbidity, including increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although previous research has made significant contributions to our understanding of the health consequences associated with neighborhood disadvantage, causal relationships have been difficult to establish due to a reliance on cross-sectional designs, selection biases and limited data on potential mechanisms. Building on the existing research infrastructure developed by our team's previously funded, ongoing natural experiment studies, we have a unique opportunity to study whether changes to the built and social environment, stimulated by substantial ($160 million) economic investment in housing development and neighborhood revitalization, improves cardio-metabolic outcomes in the intervention neighborhood relative to the matched control neighborhood which is not undergoing such changes. The study includes a randomly selected cohort of 732 low-income, African American adults, from two urban neighborhoods (intervention and control communities). Our study will be the first natural experiment to examine the impact of a place-based natural experiment strategy (rather than residential mobility strategy) on clinically relevant cardio-metabolic outcomes (BMI, HbA1c, blood pressure, and lipids) in a high-risk, though understudied, African American population. We will leverage existing data from our previously funded studies on potential mediators, including measures of the built and social environment, and health behaviors including diet, physical activity and sleep (objective and subjective measures). In this proposal, we will add measured cardio-metabolic outcomes, including blood pressure, HbA1c, and lipids. The next stage of economic revitalization of the intervention neighborhood is focused on redevelopment of housing. Thus, in addition, the proposed study is optimally timed to add survey measures of perceptions of housing conditions, neighborhood-level audits of housing conditions, and compilation of secondary data from publically available resources on housing sales, vacancy rates, etc.,             before and after the housing changes occur. Understanding the impact and pattern of neighborhood revitalization as it unfolds over time is critical in the arsenal of policies to mitigte pervasive racial/ ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in obesity and cardio-metabolic health."
"9552698","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Increased fragility of cardiac myocyte (CM) membranes during pathological processes such as pressure overload or ischemia/reperfusion, can lead to CM dysfunction, membrane rupture and ultimately CM death. While this phenomenon has been studied extensively, the mechanisms underlying it remain incompletely defined. Preservation of CM membrane integrity requires strong and stable connections of CMs with the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). CM attachment to the ECM is mediated by integrin complexes, which are in part localized at the unique site within CMs termed costameres. Integrins bind directly to ECM proteins but require adaptor proteins to link with the actin cytoskeleton and sarcomeres within the cell. A critical adapter that is also crucial for functional activation of integrins in most cells, is Talin, the fous of this proposal. Preliminary data show that Talin is essential for the structural support of costameres and thus for CM membrane stability. It is hypothesized that talin plays a role in CMs as an integrin-actin linker, and also regulates integrin protein trafficking. As such it contribute to maintenance of costamere structure and preserves the integrity of cells. Further, when talin protein is cleaved by calpain proteases during insults such as myocardial infarction, cellular fragility, cellular rupture and even cell death, can occur. This in turn can lead to elaboration of ECM production and deleterious remodeling responses which includes fibrosis. Much of this remodeling is propagated by cardiac fibroblasts (CF), where talin is also highly expressed and where it may play an important role in cell growth. This proposal will pursue a series of studies to assess the function of talin in the heart. First the mechanism(s) that lead to heart failure in he talin deficient heart will be evaluated with a focus on how integrin trafficking is involved in thi process. Study of the mechanisms that lead to increased integrin endocytosis and degradation will be specifically evaluated. Understanding this process is important since it can affect cell adhesion of CMs to the ECM within the heart. None of these details has been studied previously in CMs. Studies will also define how cell tension that is altered in talin deficient myocytes, can lead to costameric disruption. Preliminary studies using atomic force microscopy show that talin deletion from CMs reduces membrane tension. Studies will test how decreased tension in talin deficient CMs increases integrin turnover at the costameres, potentially producing weaker cell-ECM connections; leading to cellular and whole heart dysfunction. Cleavage of proteins by calpain proteases has been linked to CM dysfunction. Talin protein is cleaved by calpain. This in part lead to the hypothesis that calpain-mediated cleavage of talin can cause sarcolemmal rupture and cell death, and that abolition of this process can protect the heart from damage. To test this, a calpain-resistant talin transgene will be used in the context of in vivo ischemia-reperfusion, and ex vivo hypoxia/re-oxygenation models. Calpain activation and talin cleavage usually occurs in these models. Studies will be performed using wild-type mice prone to talin cleavage, and transgenic ones expressing the talin variant which is resistant to calpain cleavage. These unique models, and cells derived from them, will allow direct testing if prevention of talin cleavage will protect CMs and the whole heart from stress-related damage. Finally, studies will be pursued detailing how talin expression in CFs influences proliferation, growth, elaboration of ECM and ultimately, the fibrotic response of the heart. This is important since cardiac fibrosis occurs as part of multiple cardiac pathologies, and can lead to deleterious cardiac function and arrhythmias, even if myocardial function is preserved. It is suggested that talin may play important roles to modulate myocardial fibrosis. The clinical significance of this project is that heart failure of varied causes is found in a large number of VA patients, necessitating frequent hospitalizations and attention to outpatient care. Identification of root causes of cardiac dysfunction and importantly, studies which could lead to novel therapeutics for heart failure are essential, and will be the focus of this proposal."
"9474827","Heterogeneity is a pervasive feature of cancer, central to progression and therapy failure. Both genetic and nongenetic factors, cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions contribute to tumor cell phenotypic variation. Thus, heterogeneity is a complex multiscale problem difficult to study by reductionist approaches but well suited to systems thinking. A mechanistic, system-level understanding of heterogeneity would spawn fundamental advances in cancer treatment strategies. Major challenges include definition of relevant tumor cell phenotypes, phenotype dynamics emergence from single-cell behavior and interactions, and effective targeting strategies. In our Center, we will use systems biology approaches to tackle these challenges, focusing on small cell lung cancer (SCLC), in which the impact of intratumor heterogeneity is particularly compelling. Thus, SCLC tumors, while histo-pathologically homogeneous with classic ?small blue round cell? morphology, are comprised of phenotypic subpopulations (e.g., tumor-propagating cells; Hes1+ cells; CD44+ cells) that cooperate to form a tumor ecosystem adaptive to drug treatment. In SCLC genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and patient tumors, accumulated genetic alterations (e.g., MYC amplification, NOTCH mutations) may bias phenotypic compositions and consequent drug sensitivity, underscoring the combined role of genetic and nongenetic sources. The overall goal of our proposed Center is a system-level understanding of the impact of SCLC phenotype heterogeneity in drug evasion, that will open avenues to novel treatment strategies. In two highly integrated Projects, we will combine experimentation with mathematical modeling to generate a comprehensive blueprint of SCLC phenotypic space and identify complex phenotype dynamics underlying treatment resistance. Project 1 will use high-dimensional cytometry and transcriptomics data to define human and GEMM core SCLC phenotypes, their susceptibility to genomic alteration bias, and their drug response plasticity. Project 2 will study SCLC phenotype dynamics initiated by cell-cell and secreted factors or exosomes in SCLC tumor ecosystems, using models of cell population dynamics driving tumor aggressiveness. Projects will be supported by a Single-Cell Biology and Data Analysis Shared Resource equipped with a vast palette of state-of-the-art single-cell technologies, including mass cytometry, scRNA-Seq and multidimensional data analysis. The Center will be located at Vanderbilt University and a satellite site at Stanford contributing highly-regarded SCLC GEMMs. Experimental systems will encompass human and GEMM SCLC cell lines and tumors. Our Center investigators have a track record of co-authored publications in SCLC and/or systems biology. The Administrative Core will provide leadership and communication across the Center while the Outreach Core will promote collaborations and disseminate knowledge and tools on SCLC and cancer heterogeneity. We expect that iteration between experiments and modeling will bring about a system-level understanding of SCLC tumor heterogeneity with lessons generally applicable to any cancer type."
"9552687","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Abstract Sepsis affects more than 800,000 people annually with a mortality rate as high as 30% in the US. Severe sepsis complicated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a leading cause of death in intensive therapy units with a mortality rate exceeding 50%. Acute lung injury (ALI) is an important component of MODS and often serves as a direct cause of patient death. Nonetheless, few effective therapeutic targets have been identified that predispose an individual to MODS and ALI in sepsis. Alveolar macrophages (AM) are at the center of the pathogenesis of ALI triggered by sepsis. Macrophage (M?pyroptosis is a recently identified caspase-1-dependent programmed cell death, which features rapid plasma-membrane rupture and release of pro-inflammatory intracellular contents. However, the in vivo role of M?yroptosis in the progression of sepsis and the mechanism underlying M?yroptosis remain unclear.  We now demonstrate in our preliminary studies that sepsis induces AM and circulating monocytes pyroptosis in a mouse polymicrobial sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). This sepsis-induced pyroptosis is mediated by a novel signaling pathway, in which (RAGE)-dependent endocytosis of HMGB1) activates pyroptosome assembly and cell pyroptosis. Our further observations suggest that induction of AM pyroptosis enhances inflammation by releasing or promoting healthy AM to release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, augmenting polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) chemotaxis and suppressing T lymphocyte migration. receptor for advanced glycation end products high mobility group box 1 ( Moreover, we have also shown in our previous and preliminary studies that LPS and HMGB1 throughTLR4 upregulate TLR2 in AM, which in turn augments AM pyroptosis in response to bacteria-derived TLR2 ligands.  Based on these findings, we hypothesize that: 1) AM pyroptosis may promote the development of ALI in sepsis by amplifying the inflammatory process; 2) HMGB1-RAGE signaling serves as a novel mechanism that induces AM pyroptosis in sepsis; and 3) TLR4 signaling-upregulated TLR2 serves as an important mechanism for augmented AM pyroptosis in sepsis. In order to test these hypotheses, we propose the following three specific aims: Specific Aim #1: to determine the role of AM pyroptosis in the development of ALI following sepsis. Specific Aim #2: to determine the molecular mechanism through which sepsis induces AM pyroptosis. Specific Aim #3: to determine the mechanism of TLR2 signaling-primed AM pyroptosis in sepsis."
"9489060","Aminoglycoside antibiotics remain first line therapy for gram negative infections and are used in conjunction with other antibiotics for certain gram positive organisms. Aminoglycosides, especially gentamicin, have also been used to suppress premature stop codon termination of protein synthesis leading to monogenic diseases like cystic fibrosis and Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy. Unfortunately, they still have an unacceptably high rate of dose and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity, especially in the elderly and in patients with chronic kidney, heart and liver disease. We have previously identified non-nephrotoxic, yet bactericidal, congeners of gentamicin that we now propose to use to determine their efficacy in suppressing premature termination codons (PTC). To do this we will use a human proximal tubule cell line with a novel FRET probe allowing for ratiometric quantitation of readthrough of different embedded stop codons. This will be followed by in vivo studies, again using the FRET probe, but now with 2-photon microscopy in kidney proximal tubule cells labeled by subcapsular delivery of specifically designed plasmids based on the cell culture data. To test the clinical potential of this approach we will study the mdx mouse and quantify dystropin synthesis in response to dose and duration dependent therapy. Finally, we will develop a transgenic mouse for the most appropriate stop codon, determined by the rat studies, and quantify readthrough in multiple tissues throughout the body. This is particularly important as many solid tumor cancers have monogenic premature termination codons that lead to malignant transformation of the cell type and these are also responsive to suppression therapy by aminoglycosides. We hypothesize that gentamicin congeners, with markedly reduced nephrotoxicity, will provide enhanced suppression of PTC leading to synthesis of functional proteins needed to reduce and/or prevent multiple PTC diseases. The nontoxic congeners will allow us to directly compare and contrast differences between toxic and nontoxic forms thereby leading to greater understanding of the factors mediating premature termination codon suppression in multiple cell types. These studies will provide the information necessary to enhance translation into clinical studies of multiple diseases."
"9469716","Integration of Clinical and Omic Data for Improved Prediction of Patient Outcome PI: Matthew Ruffalo ? Sponsors: Ziv Bar-Joseph, Stef? Oesterreich A Project Summary This project comprises a data integration and machine learning methodology to improve performance in predicting patient outcome ? speci?cally, response to cancer treatments. Multiple disparate data types will be combined for this task, including omic data (somatic mutations, gene expression, methylation), interaction networks, drug target information, and previously-unavailable clinical data, to produce better predictions of response to speci?c cancer treatments.  The proposed methods will use relationships between genes and proteins (often represented as protein in- teraction networks) to construct composite features from omic data, and use these features as inputs to machine learning algorithms, to improve prediction performance of classi?cation methods when applied to clinically rel- evant prediction tasks. Additionally, this project will use clinical data at a level that is not typically available for breast cancer samples, obtained via the Center for Big Data for Better Health (BD4BH) collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. This data includes time-series clinical data spanning ?ve years of breast cancer treatment, such as medication administration, laboratory results, pathology reports, symptoms, and other types of data. This clinical data will be integrated into composite features in order to fur- ther improve prediction performance. This feature construction methodology will also allow the investigation of which cellular processes and pathways are most strongly associated with clinical outcomes, such as response to speci?c treatments and patient survival.  While this approach shows promise in improving classi?cation/prediction performance in clinically relevant tasks such as survival and response to treatment, models learned from these integrated features may still over?t the classi?cation task and may not generalize to other cancers or drugs with similar mechanisms of action. As such, this method will integrate cell line expression data from the LINCS project into the predictive features. The LINCS program has pro?led gene expression changes in cell lines under two broad categories: introduction of small molecules, and gene knockouts. Both sets of data will be used to constrain the sets of genes that are used as features for prediction of response to treatment of certain drugs. A central hypothesis of this proposal is that many cellular processes and cancer types respond in similar ways to such perturbations, allowing the use of a multi-task learning method to identify the commonalities in cellular response to these drugs across cell lines. Such methods will also allow for identi?cation of cell-type-speci?c and cancer-speci?c responses to such perturbations, identifying those networks and processes that speci?cally relate to response to treatment in speci?c cancers. Results will be validated via new in vitro cell line experiments, demonstrating that the constructed features are informative in clinical settings. 1"
"9458039","A new Escherichia coli strain called ST131-H30 ? unknown prior to 2000 ? is now the single most common cause of E. coli infections such as urinary tract infections, particularly those associated with resistance to first- line antibiotics. Veterans are especially vulnerable to ST131-H30, which causes 25-30% of all their E. coli infections, and 70-75% of those involving fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin) resistance. Gut colonization is an important upstream step in ST131-H30 infections, and therefore is a key part of the ST131-H30 epidemic. We have found that, in veterans and their household members, gut colonization with fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli (12-13% overall) is quite prolonged (possibly years), is significantly longer for ST131-H30 than other resistant E. coli, and is attributable more to strain persistence than frequent transmission. This suggests the possibility of reducing gut colonization with ST131-H30 by identifying modifiable risk factors, host immune factors, bacterial traits, and characteristics of the gut microbiota that correlate with prolonged H30 colonization and loss of colonization, to inform the development of appropriate interventions. Accordingly, we propose to augment our current longitudinal fecal surveillance of H30-colonized veterans and household members by:   identifying epidemiological risk factors for presence and loss of H30 colonization   identifying humoral and cell-mediated immune correlates of presence and loss of H30 colonization   identifying genomic differences between initial vs. final, and shorter vs. longer-persisting, fecal ST131-  H30 isolates  identifying shifts in the gut microbiota (i.e., bacterial community and E. coli population) that correspond  with presence and loss of H30 colonization. The results of these studies can be expected to provide essential information needed for the design of interventions (e.g., risk factor modification, vaccines, anti-colonization drugs, and pre- or probiotics) to reduce gut colonization with the ST131-H30 strains that cause infections in veterans. Such interventions should help to reduce the enormous disease burden from infections caused by multi-resistant E. coli, mainly ST131-H30."
"9472248","PROJECT 1: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Approximately 5% of patients of with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) develop symptoms before age 65 in the absence of a known autosomal dominant mutation. Patients with non-familial early-onset AD (EO-AD) show greater deficits in executive function, attention, language and visuospatial abilities and relatively spared episodic memory compared to patients with late-onset AD (LO-AD). Non-amnestic and hippocampal-sparing AD phenotypes are far more common in patients with EO disease. Accurately diagnosing AD in EO patients is challenging due to the atypical clinical presentations and overlap with non-AD dementia, and misdiagnosis rates are high even at expert centers. Molecular and neurodegenerative biomarkers are likely to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis, but few studies have addressed their performance in patients with EO disease - results from LO-AD studies may not generalize to EO populations because of differences in degenerative patterns and reference ranges. Furthermore, patients with EO-AD may harbor unrecognized susceptibility factors that lead to disease onset at such a young age. While the apolipoprotein E ?4 allele is strongly correlated with young age-of-onset, it is present in only ~50% of EO patients, suggesting that additional mechanisms of vulnerability have yet to be discovered. Leveraging on the strength of the UCSF ADRC in recruiting and characterizing patients with early-onset AD, this study will apply detailed clinical phenotyping, multi-modal neuroimaging and novel genetic approaches to optimize early-stage diagnosis and to elucidate mechanisms of vulnerability in EO-AD. We will evaluate 100 mildly impaired (CDR 0.5-1) early-onset (estimated age of onset ?65) patients recruited from the Clinical core. All patients will meet NIA-AA criteria for MCI or probable AD and demonstrate evidence of AD pathology based on a positive amyloid (florbetapir) PET scan. Comparative data from 100 matched normal controls (NC) and 75 non-AD dementia patients will be acquired via the Clinical and Imaging cores. Aim 1 will test the diagnostic performance of (1) CSF and (2) hippocampal versus cortically-based MRI biomarkers in distinguishing EO-AD from NC and non-AD dementia. Aim 2 will build on preliminary data suggesting that ApoE4 modifies the phenotype of EO-AD, testing the hypothesis that ApoE4 carriers will show greater memory impairment and hippocampal atrophy and lower amyloid compared to E4 non-carriers. A hypothesis-generating Aim 3 will apply novel genetic tools to study vulnerability factors in EO-AD, hypothesizing that: (1) ApoE4-positive and E4-negative patients will show differential gene expression patterns in peripheral blood, reflecting involvement of distinct biological pathways; and (2) by screening EO-AD patients with a gene chip that includes ~250,000 rare, protein-altering genetic markers, we will identify novel risk variants in genes implicated in AD pathogenic pathways. Overall, this project will facilitate the early and accurate diagnosis of EO-AD, and will further our understanding of susceptibility factors associated with pre-senile disease onset."
"9480798","CANCER TISSUE AND PATHOLOGY SHARED RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT The Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource (Tissue SR; Category 4.06) facilitates tissue-based investigation through the procurement of human cancer specimens and comprehensive histopathologic services. The resource is highly integrated, serving individual and team projects in Winship's four research programs and interfacing directly with Winship's other shared resources. The tissue procurement and banking component consists of an IRB-approved Human Tissue Procurement Service (HTPS) located within the Emory University Hospital (EUH) and Winship Building C, with affiliated banking sites at Grady Memorial Hospital (Grady), Emory University Hospital Midtown (EUHM), Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital (ESJH), and Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (Aflac). Procurement personnel are highly experienced in anatomic pathology and tissue banking protocols, with quality assurance provided by Department of Pathology faculty members. Tumor, adjacent non-tumor tissues, blood, and other biospecimens on specialized protocols are procured according to standardized operating procedures as frozen, fresh, fixed, or other specified preparation and inventoried and tracked using the Nautilus LIMS? system. Over 75,000 specimens are stored and available for use. Tissues are distributed to Winship investigators with IRB-approved protocols to support clinical, translational, basic, and epidemiologic research. Pathology services are provided by the Research Pathology Laboratory (RPL) component, a full service lab located in Winship Building C with experienced personnel and equipment for tissue processing, histological and immunohistochemical staining, laser capture microscopy, tissue microarrays, whole slide scanning for digital pathology, and standard and advanced capabilities for pathology image analytics. The lab processes large volumes of samples derived from human disease and animal models and works in close collaboration with the other shared resources and with Winship's research programs, as demonstrated by research productivity and support of group science grants. The success of this shared resource is highlighted by its national leadership in several NCI-driven initiatives, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Cancer Human Biobank (caHUB), and Minority Biospecimen/Biobanking Geographic Management Program (BMaP). This shared resource provides centralized, efficient, and high quality services that are not duplicated by other Emory University facilities."
"9454219","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Candidate Background: I (Dr. James McNally, Ph.D.) currently serve as a postdoctoral fellow with the preclinical schizophrenia (Sz) research group headed by Dr. Robert W. McCarley, at the VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS), Brockton campus. I have held this position since 2008 (~4.5 years), following completion of my Ph.D. studies at the UMass Medical School. Since joining this group, my research has been focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia (Sz). Sz is a devastating psychiatric illness, which affects ~1% of individuals over the age of 18. This disease warrants increased interest in the VA research community, given the higher instance of Sz among the veteran population, treatment of which accounts for some 40% of VA mental healthcare costs nationally. Veterans with Sz experience high levels of disability and poor community outcome. While clinically identified by the appearance of positive symptoms (psychosis, hallucinations) and negative symptoms (flattened affect, deficits in attention/motivation), deficits in fundamental cognitive processes (working memory, executive function) serve as a major determinant of the long-term disability associated with this illness. Current therapeutic strategies (first and second generation antipsychotics) do not satisfactorily address Sz-related cognitive issues. Thus, development of novel Sz therapeutics which better alleviate all symptom classes associated with this disease represents important clinical need.  While the mechanisms responsible for the cognitive deficiencies associated with Sz remain poorly understood, they have been linked to abnormalities in gamma band (30-80 Hz) oscillations (GBO). Clinical and postmortem studies suggest that these abnormalities stem from impaired cortical circuitry. Recently I have developed a novel in vitro model to allow analysis of GBO at the single-neuron level. This model employs acute slices of mouse prelimbic cortex, the rodent analogue of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an area heavily implicated in Sz related cognitive deficits. Presently we are using this system to model Sz-related abnormalities in GBO, and are exploring developmental alterations in this activity (see: Preliminary data and Appendix). Further, I have centrally involved in the development of in vivo methods using either optogenetic or auditory stimulation to evoke GBO in freely moving mice. I believe the combination of our in vitro and in vivo GBO models provide a powerful means to allow detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms behind the generation of GBO, and potentially provide a means to evaluate new pharmacological therapeutic strategies specifically addressing the cognitive impairments associated with Sz. Current Proposal: Recent studies suggest that positive modulators of the type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) represent a novel class of antipsychotics with cognitive enhancing properties. In this revised proposal we will directly examine the effects of mGluR5 on the development and maintenance of the neocortical circuitry responsible for the generation of GBO. The overall hypothesis to be tested posits that mGluR5 mediated enhancement of NMDAR activity is essential for the proper development and maintenance of the neural circuitry responsible for GBO. Further, positive modulation of mGluR5 can alleviate Sz-like NMDAR hypofunction, and restore abnormal GBO observed in in vitro and in vivo NMDAR antagonist models of Sz. As the effects of mGluR5 on GBO have yet to be explored, this work is novel, and will provide valuable insight for the development of agents improving cognitive function in Sz. Long-Term Goals: If funded this VA Career Development Award will provide me with training in a number of areas critical to successful completion of the research proposed above (ie. targeted viral protein expression, optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology). This increased skill set and experience will provide me the resources needed for my progression as a successful independent scientist in the VA research community."

"9474120","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision Abstract Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  Difficulty in accessing print imposes obstacles to education, employment, social interaction and recreation.  The ongoing transition to the production and distribution of digital documents brings about new opportunities for people with visual impairment.  Digital documents on computers and mobile devices permit easy manipulation of print size, contrast polarity, font, page layout and other attributes of text.  In short, we now hae unprecedented opportunities to adapt text format to meet the needs of visually impaired readers.  In recent years, our laboratory and others in the vision-science community have made major strides in understanding the impact of different forms of low vision on reading, and the dependence of reading performance on key text properties such as character size and contrast.  But innovations in reading technology have outstripped our knowledge about low-vision reading.  A major gap still exists in translating these laboratory findings into methods for customizing text displays for people with low vision.  The broad aim of the current proposal is to apply our knowledge about the impact of vision impairment on reading to provide tools and methods for enhancing reading accessibility in the modern world of digital reading technology.  Our research plan has three specific goals:   1) To develop and validate an electronic version of the MNREAD test of reading vision, to extend this technology to important text variables in addition to print size, and to develop methods for customizing the selection of text properties for low-vision readers.  MNREAD is the most widely used test of reading in vision research and was originally developed in our laboratory with NIH support.  2) To investigate the ecology of low-vision reading in order to better understand how modern technologies, such as iPad and Kindle are being used by people with low vision.  We plan to evaluate the feasibility of using internet methods to survey low-vision individuals concerning their reading behavior and goals, and of collecting approximate measures of visual function over the internet.  We also plan to develop an accessibility checker to help low-vision computer users and their families to evaluate the accessibility of specific text displays.  3) To enhance reading accessibility by developing methods for enlarging the visual span (the number of adjacent letters that can be recognized without moving the eyes).  A reduced visual span is thought to be a major factor limiting reading in low vision, especially for people with central-field loss from macular degeneration.  We have already demonstrated methods for enlarging the visual span in peripheral vision.  We plan to develop a more effective perceptual training method for enlarging the visual span, with the goal of improving reading performance for people with central-vision loss."
"9553350","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Background: Prostate cancer incidence and death rates are among the highest in American men. The etiology of prostate cancer is not known but based on the literature the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is capable of blocking the carcinogenic estrogen metabolic pathway by metabolizing catechol-estrogens rendering them inactive and thus, plays a role in preventing carcinogenesis. Preliminary data and prior publications from the laboratory support a protective role for COMT in prostate cancer. Research Objectives: The main goal of this project is to determine the role of the COMT gene in prostate cancer. We hypothesize that: (1) reduced COMT is a risk factor for prostate cancer, progression and poor patient outcome, (2) over-expressing the COMT gene can inhibit prostate cancer cells by affecting cell growth and progression pathways, and (3) COMT expression in prostate cells is regulated by epigenetic factors. Project Design and Methods: Aim #1. COMT expression in prostate cancer patients. Existing resources of prostate tissues consisting of benign prostatic hyperplasia and matched normal and cancer specimens from cancer patients will be utilized. The following experiments will be performed: (a) microdissection of normal adjacent and cancer regions from prostate cancer tissues, (b) determine COMT RNA expression levels by real-time PCR, (c) determine COMT protein levels by immunohistochemistry, and (d) determine if COMT expression is associated with cancer incidence, stage, grade, and patient outcome. Accomplishment of these goals will determine whether COMT down-regulation is associated with prostate cancer and assess COMT as a biomarker for prostate cancer. Aim #2. Functional significance of COMT in prostate cancer cells. Prostate cell lines will be used for the following experiments: (a) analyze constitutive COMT expression levels in normal and prostate cancer (androgen dependent and independent or castration resistant) cells by real-time PCR and Western blot analyses, (b) over-express COMT in those cancer cell lines with low COMT expression by establishing stable COMT-expressing clones, (c) measure methoxyestrogen level, cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, cell invasion, and migration in COMT-expressing cells by flow cytometry and biological assays, (d) evaluate the effects of COMT on cell morphology by microscopy and expression of other genes involved in cell proliferation and cancer progression pathways by gene arrays and Western blot analyses, and (e) determine the effect of COMT on prostate tumor growth in vivo. Accomplishment of these experiments will determine the functional effects of COMT on cell growth and progression pathways in prostate cancer which may implicate COMT as a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer treatment. Aim #3. Epigenetic regulation of the COMT gene in prostate cancer. Clinical patient specimens (Aim #1) and cell lines (Aim #2) will be used in the following experiments: (a) analyze COMT DNA methylation using sodium bisulfite modification / methylation-specific PCR, (b) determine the histone modification status using chromatin- immunoprecipitation analysis, (c) measure the activity of histone modifying enzymes in cells, (d) correlate COMT epigenetic status and enzyme activities with RNA expression levels determined in Aims #1 and #2, and (e) Determine if demethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors can re-express COMT in prostate cancer cells. Accomplishment of these experiments will determine the mechanisms of regulation of COMT expression in prostate cancer. Veterans Clinical Relevance: The proposed research will generate important insights into COMT's role in prostate cancer etiology, progression, and patient outcome. This could lead to improved methods of identifying Veterans at higher risk for prostate cancer. The proposed research may also reveal COMT to be an important biomarker and therapeutic target for prostate cancer that could translate to the clinic and benefit Veterans."
"9459390","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care."
"9533093","Summary It is now well accepted that the immune, hematopoietic and skeletal systems have major interactions, which occur for the most part, between the bone and bone marrow. Osteoclasts, the cells that resorb bone, are important cellular mediators of skeletal homeostasis and are derived from hematopoietic precursors that also give rise to immune cells. In addition, numerous cytokines, which were first shown to regulate immune cell function, are now known to regulate bone cells and influence skeletal health. Conversely, cells in the osteoblast lineage and their cytokines are critical for the development of the hematopoietic stem cell niche and the normal development of the hematopoietic and immune cell lineages. All too frequently, scientists involved in immune or bone cell research fail to interact in a significant way because each discipline developed independently and, for the most part, has remained separate. The fundamental hypothesis of the organizers of this conference is that progress in the field of osteoimmunology, which is the study of the interactions of bone, hematopoietic and immune cells in health and disease, will be hastened through the establishment of better communication between bone biologists, hematologist and immunologists. The goal of The Seventh International Conference on Osteoimmunology: Interactions of the Immune and Skeletal Systems is to bring together scientists from these fields in a setting that will facilitate, interactions and new collaborations and accelerate progress towards understanding the interconnections of the immune, hematopoietic and skeletal systems. Our six previous meetings were highly successful and were attended by 100-150 participants from all over the world. We believe that the next meeting, like its predecessors, will also be highly successful and facilitate achieving the goal of the conference."
"9471310","The main function of the Bone Stem Cell Core (Core C) is to isolate and distribute bone marrow- derived mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (BMSCs) to the investigators of the individual projects, and to provide technical support for use of the cells. A key component essential to the success of the proposed Program Project is the availability of BMSCs because all projects require these cells. Thus, a centralized Core facility for the production of quality cells is crucial to the success of this dynamically coordinated Program Project. This Core will benefit the research efforts of individual investigator by reducing costs, providing quality control for study procedures, and enhancing collaborations among multiple disciplines to achieve greater scientific gain through an integrated approach. In addition, production and distribution of cells from a centralized facility will ensure that all studies start with cells of the same lineages and background. The Specific Aims are: 1. Isolate, characterize and distribute mouse BMSCs, human bone marrow MSCs (hMSCs), and 2. Provide ongoing technical support for hypoxic and conventional MSC culture and differentiation (osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic) assays. By achieving these objectives, this Core will function as a unique resource to provide mouse and human BMSCs and technical assistance to the individual projects, as well as to other Georgia Regents University investigators who are interested in studies related to aging, metabolic bone diseases, or stem cell research."

"9458101","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tendon injuries are a common problem exacerbated in the aging population. Significant pain and disability are associated with these injuries resultig in decreased quality of life, loss of work and independence. Interactions involving small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) and other matrix molecules are central to the regulation of the hierarchical assembly of tendon, as well as in the establishment or re-establishment of tendon mechanical function. The class I SLRPs, decorin and biglycan, exhibit alterations in expression during growth, aging and in the injury response. The absence of decorin ameliorates the mechanical and fibril parameter changes associated with aging and is detrimental to the tendon injury response. These data suggest critical regulatory roles for SLRPs in tendon. Unfortunately, progress in this area has been limited by the model systems available. Use of conventional knockout mice does not allow control of temporal or spatial specificity and secondary and compensatory effects cannot be controlled. To address this, we developed inducible-null mouse models to isolate age and injury specific effects while avoiding confounding issues. The overall goal of this proposal is to delineate the coordinated mechanisms whereby alterations in decorin and biglycan expression influence the detrimental effects seen during the aging, as well as in injury and repair processes. During tendon aging, the interactions involving SLRPs that result in an impaired injury response will be defined. Our general hypothesis is that tendon aging and the impaired age-associated response to tendon injuries are the result of similar SLRP-mediated mechanisms. Specifically, sequential changes in the differential expression of biglycan and decorin provide coordinate regulatory interactions required for re-establishment of tendon structure and function. These patterns are disrupted with aging resulting in altered structure, function and repair ability. The study aims are: Aim 1: Define mechanisms whereby SLRPs influence tendon aging. Aim 2: Define the mechanism whereby aging alters the regulatory role(s) of SLRPs in the tendon injury response. Aim 3: Determine the differential effect(s) of the addition of SLRPs in the tendon injury response with aging. We will utilize our novel inducible mouse models and exploit their temporal specificity to systematically define the roles of decorin and biglycan in tendon aging and in the associated altered injury response. This will be coupled with systemic administration of SLRPs to generate four distinct compositions for analyses of the mechanistic roles. Our flexor tendon injury model coupled with sophisticated and innovative measures of mechanical and organizational properties, together with compositional profiles will be used to derive a mechanistic understanding of these responses. Further, these analyses will provide a fundamental understanding of the regulatory interactions of decorin and bigylcan in aging and in the injury response. Finally, this information will provide a framework for further investigation into the contrasting and potentially synergistic roles of these SLRPs that will aid i the design of improved treatments for age associated tendon injuries."

Yet, a majority of students do not pursue research careers, principally because of lack of exposure to biomedical research. This competing renewal proposal for our Summer Veterinary Student Research Program (SVSRP) at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine (VMCVM) will train veterinary medicine students in research skills and encourage them to pursue a research career. We will recruit from all 30 accredited veterinary medical schools in the nation, particularly from Tuskegee University with the objective of recruiting underrepresented minorities. A total of 6 new DVM-seeking scholars will be recruited each year during the next five year funding period of the program. SVSRP will provide students with experience in areas of research that couple student interests with research in animal models of infectious disease, immunology and inflammation and vertebrate genetics. Mentors will be assigned by the Advisory and Selection Committee to applicants based on applicant interests. Students will receive training in the writing of research proposals and scientific papers, biostatistics and experimental design, reports and presentations, visual display of quantitative information. Their training will also include humane care and use of animal models and the ethical conduct of research as led by speakers with expertise in human experimentation, the Belmont Report, the Animal Welfare Act, scientific integrity and rigor and reproducibility. A unique feature of this program will be a visit to the NIH, USDA, and other agencies in Washington, DC to better understand research career opportunities for veterinarians and to learn how public policy is influenced by research. After completing orientation and writing a research proposal, students will spend nine weeks in the mentor's laboratory doing research. To sustain interest in biomedical research, we will organize a weekly meeting with successful DVM researchers from academia, government, or biotech industries. VMCVM has successfully administered summer research training programs in the past, culminating in training 143 DVM students in biomedical research since 1995. Since administering this T35 SVSRP in 2006, we have completed essentially all that we originally proposed during the last 10 years. Renewal of this SVSRP will enable the VMCVM to continue providing opportunities and training to DVM students in biomedical research and encourage pursuit of a research-based career as world-class scientists."
"9439637","The dismal mortality rate for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is attributed to the fact that it is a highly chemo-resistant and aggressive cancer. Current therapies have also not been able to eradicate cancer stem cells (CSCs), which can reestablish tumors following treatment. Notably, PDAC tumors are associated with intensely collagen-rich stroma that we have shown can mediate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and contribute to cancer cell invasion. PDAC tumors are also associated with dys-regulation of mRNA translation. We have provided evidence that PDAC cells in 3D collagen activate MNK kinases to mediate eIF4E phosphorylation and regulate mRNA translation of EMT regulators. The long-term goal is to contribute toward the development of novel mechanism-based targeted therapies for the treatment of PDAC. The main objective in this application is to determine how MNK kinases mediate tumor development and progression in vivo. The central hypothesis is that targeting MNK kinases will decrease PDAC tumor growth and metastasis and suppress the CSC population. A second hypothesis is that targeting MNK kinases will lead to remodeling and normalization of the stroma in PDAC tumors. These hypotheses are based on extensive preliminary data demonstrating that MNK inhibitors decrease invasion in 3D collagen, suppress growth of human PDAC organoids, decrease mRNA translation of the EMT activators ZEB1 and Snail, decrease the CSC population, and decrease collagen production by stellate cells. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the role of MNK kinases in PDAC progression in organoid and mouse models; 2) Evaluate the role of MNK kinases in regulating pancreatic CSCs; and 3) Determine the role of MNK kinases in regulating the stromal reaction in vivo. Under the first aim, the relative contribution of MNK1 and MNK2 to tumor progression in human PDAC organoids, and in orthotopic and transgenic mouse models, will be determined. Their roles in enhancing mRNA translation of EMT regulators and other pro-tumorigenic MNK target genes will be evaluated. For the second aim, studies will be performed to evaluate the effects of MNK kinase targeting on pancreatic CSCs using in vitro and in vivo assays, and the individual contributions of MNK1 and MNK2 to the regulation of CSCs and CSC-regulating genes will be dissected. In the third aim, the mechanism by which MNK inhibitors regulate stellate cell activation and collagen production will be determined. In addition, the ability of MNK inhibitors to remodel and normalize the fibrotic stroma in mouse models will also be evaluated. There are several innovative elements in this proposal, including the identification of signaling pathways that can be targeted to eliminate CSCs in PDAC tumors and the use of a unique combination of complex models of pancreatic cancer, including in vitro organoid cultures and in vivo orthotopic and transgenic models, to delineate the role of MNK kinases in PDAC progression. We anticipate that the results of this work will be of high significance, as they will provide scientific justification for the development and future clinical trials of MNK inhibitors in PDAC."
"9418050","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dry eye disease (DED) is a common, age-related ocular condition that in its mildest forms causes bothersome symptoms of ocular discomfort, fatigue, and visual disturbance that interfere with quality of life and in its more severe forms causes chronic pain and fluctuating vision. Current treatments for DED are inadequate and expensive. Both clinical and pre-clinical research has demonstrated that inflammation of the ocular surface is associated with DED, regardless of the cause of DED. Both physicians and patients are increasingly turning to natural treatments for relief, specifically ?3 polyunsaturatd fatty acids (PUFAs). ?3 PUFAs have anti-inflammatory actions, which have led clinicians and patients to assume that this dietary supplementation helps dry eye sufferers. ?3 supplements are often recommended by clinicians and widely promoted in the lay press despite only very limited data on the efficacy of ?3 for the treatment of DED.  The Dry Eye Evaluation and Management (DREAM) addresses the scientific gap in knowledge of dry eye treatment, specifically ?3, and expands knowledge of the behavior over time of DED signs, symptoms, and inflammatory biomarkers. Completion of a sequential set of two double-masked randomized clinical trials will provide the highest level of evidence on the efficacy of ?3 for DED and information on the long-term effects of supplementation. In addition, the planned longitudinal assessment will provide the first comprehensive description of the changes in characteristics of DED over 1 year in untreated eyes (only artificial tears). Data from the clinical trials and the longitudinal assessment will allow evaluation of inflammatory biomarkers and signs that may be used in tracking and predicting change in disease status, and may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of DED. The results of these activities will form an evidence base for future research in the area of DED and ocular surface abnormalities. If ?3 proves to be efficacious it would provide an alternative to other treatments, including pharmaceuticals, thereby decreasing health expenditures for medications and professional care, and improving productivity and quality of life in those with DED. Results of DREAM will have immediate clinical implications."

"9478279","Abstract  Nearly every form of cardiac disease involves changes to the myocardial stiffness. Current clinically-viable measurement techniques to assess myocardial stiffness are ei- ther invasive and/or involve image-derived metrics. We propose the use of a new imaging method, called Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging, in measuring the me- chanical properties of myocardial tissue. The technique employs ultrasonic radiation force to displace tissue. Conventional ultrasound is then used to observe the response of the tissue to the force. We present preliminary data showing the success of this technique in imaging the changes in stiffness that occur under normal myocardial function. We pro- pose to further develop the ARFI imaging technique and then investigate the use of ARFI imaging in detecting abnormal heart function using animal models. In addition, we pro- pose human clinical studies with pediatric cardiac transplant patients. These studies will evaluate the potential of ARFI imaging to provide early detection of transplant rejection, in grading the severity of heart failure, and in distinguishing between systolic and diastolic heart failure."
"9490939","Project Summary Expansions of simple DNA repeats cause over 30 heritable neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders. For example, the two major types of myotonic dystrophy are repeat expansion disorders. DM1 is caused by long CTG trinucleotide repeats in the 5? UTR of DMPK whereas DM2 is caused by long tetranucleotide CCTG repeats in an intron of ZNF9. Experimental systems from bacteria to Drosophila to human cells have been established to investigate the mechanisms by which CTG sequences expand, or increase in length. Such studies have implicated specific roles of DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription in the expansion process. In contrast, CCTG repeats are more poorly understood, and it is unclear whether the same molecular mechanisms contributing to CTG repeat expansions also apply to CCTG repeats. This is a pressing question since individuals with DM2 have, on average, 5000 CCTG repeats in ZNF9. Moreover, the incidence of such long repeat lengths make delineating the mechanism of repeat contraction particularly attractive as a therapeutic prospect. Thus, the work proposed here seeks to establish budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a robust experimental system to investigate CCTG repeat expansions and contractions. Specifically, the proposed research will investigate the genetic control of CCTG repeat instability and define the proteins and chromatin modifications associated with CCTG repeats. My overarching hypothesis is that the genes involved in CCTG repeat instability may partially overlap with those of CTG repeats, but there will be a unique set of players owing to the distinct effect of CCTG repeats on DNA secondary structure, chromatin state, and replication dynamics. Towards this end, I will determine the effect of CCTG repeat length, orientation, and transcription on expansions and contractions. I will identify genetic and molecular determinants of CCTG repeat instability using both candidate and unbiased genetic screening approaches. In particular, identifying genes involved in CCTG repeat contraction through an unbiased genetic screen will potentially uncover genes that have no previously known role in DNA repeat maintenance. Finally, I will define the protein and chromatin landscape at CCTG repeats and compare it to CTG repeats using the innovative CRISPR-based Chromatin Affinity Purification with Mass Spectrometry (CRISPR-ChAP-MS) approach. Overall, the proposed research will have a major impact on our understanding of the molecular biology of CCTG repeats, which has significant implications for human health and disease. This work will identify potential targets for preventative and therapeutic interventions for DM2 and also serve as a model for understanding the replication and maintenance of microsatellite repeats responsible for other repeat expansion disorders."
"9428996","ABSTRACT For more than 5 decades, the US has sought to lower cervical cancer deaths through screening; however, disparities remain. Introduction of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV)-based tests and HPV vaccines have expanded cervical cancer prevention strategies and changed screening and management guidelines. As technology, guidelines, and policies change, our MultilEvel OpTimization of the CeRvIcal Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings & Populations (METRICS) PROSPR II Research Center will elucidate multilevel factors that hamper or facilitate the cervical cancer screening process and reduce disparities in vulnerable populations. METRICS unites three PROSPR I Research Centers with demonstrated capability to provide validated data for a combined cohort of ~1.2 million screened and unscreened women. Our community settings represent 3 care delivery models?safety-net system, managed care system, and primary care provider networks in Texas, Washington, and Massachusetts. We will collect, harmonize, and document > 10 years of high-quality, comprehensive cervical cancer screening process data at the patient, provider, clinic, and system levels using a rich array of electronic clinical information systems and novel data sources. Our combined cohort is socioeconomically and geographically diverse and includes vulnerable groups such as HIV-infected and uninsured women. Our three interconnected observational projects are designed to understand how cervical cancer screening is delivered across our spectrum of delivery models, and how to optimize the screening process to reduce disparities. Innovative geospatial and Bayesian statistical methods in Project 1 will better elucidate at what levels variation in screening process occurs. Project 2 will investigate how multilevel programs and policies influence adherence to guidelines for average-risk women. Project 3 will inform precision screening for women with altered risk. Based on our observational findings, in years 4-5, we will design and implement pilot interventions leveraging IT-enabled tools to address key failures in the screening process and reduce disparities. Our transdisciplinary team has epidemiologists, primary and specialty care physicians, and intervention, implementation, and healthcare delivery experts. We are poised to efficiently evaluate the full cervical cancer screening process and provide expertise, leadership, and resources for cross-organ PROSPR II collaborations. Our cores and research projects will achieve our goals of advancing understanding of screening as practiced in community settings through: (1) analysis of multilevel observational data from our heterogeneous settings with diverse populations, (2) development and testing of impactful interventions to optimize the screening process, and (3) application of our novel observational projects and quality metrics to the cancer screening processes for other organs. Based on our successful experience leading and collaborating in PROSPR I, we thoughtfully organized our four cores to be able to launch research activities and contribute to trans-PROSPR II activities quickly and effectively."
"9543240","Summary / Abstract Breast milk is associated with protection against both early childhood illness and lifelong risk of disease in offspring, but the mechanisms by which human milk bestows these protective effects are largely unknown. Intriguingly, the microbiome may represent a key link between breastfeeding practices and disease outcomes, as breastfeeding is independently associated with 1. shifts in the infant gut microbiome and 2. protection against diseases for which the microbiome has been implicated in pathogenesis. For example, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an often fatal inflammatory disease of the neonatal gut, is strongly associated with shifts in the neonatal gut microbiota prior to disease onset, and breastfeeding provides protection against NEC. This suggests that human breast milk may provide protection from disease in part by structuring the infant gut microbiota. Our long-term goal is to characterize bioactive components of breast milk that significantly alter infant gut microbial community structure and bestow protective properties on the infant gut microbiome. The goal of this project is to characterize the impact of two understudied components of breast milk: the milk microbiome and maternal immunoglobulins (IgA). Breast milk contains many putative probiotic species, but its origin and its role in structuring the offspring microbiome have not been well characterized. Additionally, breast milk contains an abundance of maternal IgA which is well-known to provide protection against infections, but its impact on gut microbial structure has not been explored. Our central hypothesis is the maternal microbiome and IgA delivered to the infant via breast milk play a critical role in shaping the infant gut microbiome. We will test this hypothesis in the following three specific aims: 1. characterize the role of maternal diet and gut microbiota in structuring the milk microbiome by using highly-controlled dietary and probiotic intervention studies coupled with culture-independent profiling of the microbiome, 2. characterize the role of the milk microbiome in establishing the gut microbiome of term and preterm infants by comparing the microbiome of breast milk and infant stool samples from mother-infant pairs, and 3. determine the influence of maternal IgA on the offspring gut microbiome using IgA-SEQ, a novel methodology that allows for high-throughput, global characterization of IgA-bound bacterial taxa in the infant gut. Completion of these aims will yield several important findings with implications for early childhood health. Currently, infant formula preparations are not supplemented with probiotics or immunoglobulins, and this research represents a first step in elucidating the importance of these components for establishment of the human microbiome. Overall, the studies proposed herein will provide insight into the importance of breast milk in early development of the microbiome and may eventually inform the design of novel probiotic therapeutics."
"9458106","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The skin harbors a diverse population of microbiota with important functions in cutaneous health and disease. The role of host-microbe interactions is well appreciated in multiple skin disorders. However, very little is known regarding host modulation of skin microbiota, and microbial regulation of host cutaneous immunity. We have previously shown that disrupting complement signaling alters the diversity and composition of skin microbiota in parallel with changing the cutaneous inflammatory milieu. Further, our RNA-seq studies indicate that genes related to complement signaling and activation are upregulated in conventionally raised mouse skin as compared to germ free mouse skin, suggesting that the commensal microbiota regulate their expression. Our overarching hypothesis is that there is a mechanistic link between the skin microbiota and complement. We posit that the skin microbiota are shaped and maintained by complement, and conversely, that the commensal microbiota modulate complement at the gene expression level. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: 1) Determine how commensals and pathogens differentially induce complement gene expression in skin. We will also determine if commensal microbiota reconstitution can tune complement gene expression and improve infection outcome in a model of skin and soft tissue infection. 2) Establish the complement effector pathways that impact cutaneous microbial composition, diversity, and quantity. Following up on preliminary data indicating that complement deficiency accelerates excisional wound healing in mouse models in parallel with shifting the colonizing microbiota, we will test the necessity and the sufficiency of the microbiot in this phenotype. Completion of the proposed studies will fill a gap in our fundamental knowledge of skin-microbe interactions, the functional consequences of disrupting these interactions, while facilitating future research questions regarding the role of skin microbiota in disease, wound healing, and infection."
"9463516","The brain relies for its function on a precise and complex pattern of axonal connections. The broad long-term goal of this project is to understand how this pattern of axon connections is set up during development. When such connections fail to form properly, or are subsequently lost, this can lead to a broad range of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. This proposal focuses particularly on RNA-based regulatory mechanisms. A key advantage of regulating gene expression at the mRNA level is that protein expression can be directed to specific subcellular regions with temporal and spatial specificity ? an important advantage in neurons, which have a high degree of spatial organization. Accordingly, RNA-based regulation plays key roles in axon guidance, neuron migration and synapse plasticity, although the specific mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, RNA-based mechanisms will be studied in regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton (Aim 1), and in axon pathway selection at a complex choice point (Aim 2). Aim 1 focuses on the microtubule cytoskeleton, which has crucial roles in neuron structure and motility. Our recent work has now identified a mechanism for RNA-based regulation of microtubules. Specifically, microtubule plus-end protein APC binds tubulin Tubb2b mRNA, at a site required for Tubb2b translation in axons, formation of dynamic microtubules in the growth cone, and neuron migration in vivo. This opens up a new field of investigation into RNA-based regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. One goal will be to investigate coordinated regulation of specific tubulin mRNAs which have APC binding sites in their 3'UTR and cause most human tubulinopathies. Another objective will use time-lapse imaging to understand specifically how RNA-based regulation controls microtubule dynamics, including fundamental new models for both microtubule initiation at the minus end, and assembly at the plus- end. In addition to axons, these mechanisms will be characterized in formation of synaptic spines. Aim 2 will continue studies of commissural axon guidance at the spinal cord midline, a well-characterized model of developmental axon pathfinding. RNA-based regulation is known to occur within commissural axons, including upregulated translation of mRNAs in distal axon segments that have crossed the midline intermediate target. However, little has been known of the mechanisms, including the RNA-binding proteins involved, their downstream mRNA targets, or upstream regulatory pathways. This Aim will characterize specific RNA-binding proteins that display highly selective expression on axon segments, strong and distinct phenotypes in midline guidance, and interactions with mRNAs regulated in axons at the midline; as well as upstream ligands and receptors that interact physically and functionally with these RNA based regulatory mechanisms. These studies will provide novel information on fundamental mechanisms of axon development, and RNA-based regulation."
"9462216","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHLBI faces major challenges in determining how best to allocate investment in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Currently, there is no consistent mechanism to evaluate and compare proposed RCTs for NHLBI to best determine where to invest its limited dollars. Novel approaches in decision science can provide valuable information to enhance the RCT prioritization process at NHLBI. The overall objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive toolkit of pragmatic value of information (VOI) approaches and the corresponding software that can be readily used by clinical researchers and funders in order to assess the value of RCTs related to heart, lung and blood diseases. In addition, we will develop standardized tables that would report each component of these calculations for an RCT to improve transparency and communication of the results. Using these methods, one can estimate the value of a perfect study that would eliminate all uncertainty and be translated immediately. Such an estimate would provide an upper bound to the value of the RCT. Alternatively; one can estimate the value of an RCT with a proposed design that would partially eliminate uncertainty. In other applications, one can derive optimal sample sizes or compare alternative designs (e.g. adaptive versus traditional) for a proposed study. Such information and presentations of expected risk and value from different RCT investments can help NHLBI with a quantitative visualization of its investment portfolio and optimize that portfolio over time."
"9462783","Core G: Neurogenetics Abstract  The Neurogenetics Core builds on the strengths of genetics of dementia at the University of Pittsburgh. Genetics studies as part of the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (PITT-ADRC) were started by Dr. Kamboh (Core Leader) in 1995 when we initiated blood collection and APOE genotyping on all participants of the PITT-ADRC. In addition to collecting blood samples from PITT- ADRC participants, we collect blood samples from ADRC and non-ADRC ancillary studies that provide additional well-characterized older controls essential for genetic association studies and endophenotype data that would help to identify novel genes for dementia.  The resources built by the PITT-ADRC Neurogenetics Core have contributed to the identification of several new genes for AD and also have served as an educational and training hub for graduate students and junior faculty at the University of Pittsburgh. The goal of the PITT-ADRC Neurogenetics Core is to continue collecting and archiving DNA and blood samples from new and existing AD patients and controls in order to enlarge our case-control and family sample and to augment the amount of existing DNA that would be critical to future efforts in identifying new genes/variants for AD. DNA and genotype (APOE and new risk markers) data will be provided to investigators upon request."
"9552672","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Asbestos causes asbestosis (pulmonary fibrosis due to asbestos) and malignancies (lung cancer and mesothelioma) by mechanisms that are not fully elucidated. The extent of alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury and repair are critical determinants of the fibrogenic potential of toxins, such as asbestos. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), the major mitochondrial deactylase, regulates mitochondrial metabolism that detoxifies mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have shown that mitochondrial ROS mediate asbestos-induced AEC DNA damage and apoptosis by a p53- and mitochondria-regulated death pathway as well as a novel mechanism by which mitochondrial human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1 (mt-hOGG1) prevents ROS-induced AEC apoptosis by preserving mitochondrial aconitase (ACO-2), which in turn prevents mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. Compared to wild type (WT) mice, we showed that Ogg1-/- mice have increased asbestos-induced lung fibrosis due in part to alveolar type II (AT2) cell apoptosis from reduced ACO-2 levels and increased mtDNA damage. SIRT3, which controls the function of mitochondrial proteins including OGG1, ACO-2, and others, can augment mtDNA repair in the setting of oxidative stress in nerve cells. Our preliminary studies show that asbestos reduces AEC SIRT3 expression; that SIRT3 deficiency promotes asbestos-induced AEC mtDNA damage, apoptosis, and pulmonary fibrosis; and that SIRT3 enforced expression (EE) attenuates oxidant-induced AEC ACO-2 depletion, mtDNA damage, and apoptosis. We reason that AEC mtDNA is a key target that integrates cell survival / death signals following exposure to asbestos by a SIRT3-regulated mechanism.  HYPOTHESIS: SIRT3 attenuates asbestos-induced AEC mtDNA damage by preserving mt-OGG1/ ACO-2 function and reducing mitochondrial dysfunction important for limiting apoptosis and lung fibrosis.  Our SPECIFIC AIMS that will be examined over the next 4 years include: (1) To determine if SIRT3 deficiency promotes AEC mtDNA damage and intrinsic apoptosis due to alterations in OGG1 and/or ACO-2 acetylation that directs protein function. We will assess the effects of SIRT3 deficiency on acetylation of OGG1 and ACO-2, mtDNA damage, and apoptosis. Sirt3-/- and lung epithelial cell specific Sirt3-/- mice will be used to assess whether SIRT3 deficiency augments asbestos- and bleomycin-induced AEC MnSOD, OGG1 and ACO-2 acetrylation, mtDNA damage, apoptosis, and pulmonary fibrosis. (2) To determine whether SIRT3 enforced expression (EE) prevents asbestos-induced AEC mitochondrial protein acetylation (total, OGG1, ACO-2, MnSOD), mtDNA damage, and apoptosis resulting from altered OGG1 / ACO-2. We will use a combination of pharmacologic (resveratrol / viniferin) and genetic approaches in vitro. We will use Sirt3-EE mice available to us and lung epithelial cell specific Sirt3 mice that we will develop to assess whether SIRT3 attenuates asbestos- and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis by preventing AEC mitochondrial protein acetylation (OGG1 and ACO-2), ACO-2 depletion, mtDNA damage, and apoptosis. (3) To determine if mitochondrial hOGG1-EE attenuates the deleterious effects of SIRT3 deficiency as occurs following asbestos exposure. In vitro studies using MLE-12 cells that overexpress mt-Ogg1 and are SIRT3 depleted will be used to assess asbestos-induced mitochondrial protein acetylation (total, OGG1, ACO-2, and MnSOD), ACO-2 levels, mtDNA damage, and intrinsic apoptosis. We will also use Mitochondrial hOgg1-EE mice in the absence and presence of SIRT3 silencing to ascertain if mt-hOGG1-EE attenuates lung fibrosis (asbestos / bleomycin) by preserving AEC ACO-2 levels and mtDNA while diminishing apoptosis.  Innovation: These studies will elucidate the importance of SIRT3 in maintaining AT2 cell mtDNA integrity crucial for preventing AT2 cell apoptosis and pulmonary fibrosis. The studies proposed will advance our understanding of lung fibrosis that may have broader implications for more common lung disorders (i.e. IPF and lung cancer) present in the veteran population for which effective treatments are needed."
"9462749","PROJECT 3 - PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  One in five patients is rehospitalized within 30 days of discharge, and dementia is known to increase this risk, yet there are no evidence-based interventions available to improve transitions or decrease rehospitalizations for patients with dementia. Poor quality care transitions from the hospital to the community cause care discontinuity, patient dissatisfaction, rehospitalizations, and serious medication errors resulting in delirium, falls or functional loss-the most common, preventable post-hospital complications in dementia. Available evidence-based transitional care interventions, which use education-focused home visits to support patients after hospitalization, improve medication management, patient health and reduce rehospitalizations. However, these interventions exclude patients with dementia, even though some dementia patients may still benefit from certain educational approaches like spaced retrieval. Additionally, their home-visit design makes these interventions unacceptable to over 45% of patients, extremely costly and inappropriate for patients who live beyond the practical geographic reach of hospital-based staff. As such, there is a critical need for low-cost, phone-based interventions to improve transitional care for all patients with dementia. In response, we developed the Coordinated-Transitional Care (C-TraC) Intervention-a novel, low-cost, phone-based intervention designed to improve transitional care quality, rehospitalizations and patient/caregiver outcomes in hospitalized patients with dementia discharged to community settings. On pilot testing, intervention patients experienced 1/3 fewer rehospitalizations than a comparable baseline group, producing an estimated savings of $1,225 per patient net of intervention costs. Patients and caregivers reported that the intervention was highly acceptable, decreased their caregiving stress and improved their medication management skills. Due to its low-cost and patient-centered design, the C-TraC intervention has the potential to rapidly disseminate. Our goal is to conduct a single-blind, prospective, randomized-controlled clinical trial to determine C-TraC's impact on 30-day rehospitalizations (primary outcome), caregiver stress, and the patient- centered post-hospital outcomes of delirium prevention/resolution, functional maintenance/recovery and falls prevention in patients with dementia discharged from the hospital to the community. This proposed work directly aligns with transitional care research goals outlined by The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (Strategies 2.F, 3.B), the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) and the NIA."
"9457438","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurrent ocular herpetic disease, a major cause of vision loss worldwide, occurs following reactivation of latent herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) from sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglia (TG). Our long-term goal is to develop a safe and efficient immunotherapeutic vaccine to stop virus reactivation and shedding in tears. While HSV-specific CD8+ T cells are critical in reducing virus reactivations, they also appear to be associated with the immuno-pathology that leads to corneal herpetic lesions. During the last 5 years, we have made several significant findings that form the basis of this competitive renewal application: (1) HSV-specific memory CD8+ T cells from naturally protected seropositive asymptomatic (ASYMP) individuals (those who are infected but never develop recurrent ocular herpes) are mainly effector memory T cells (TEM cells). In contrast, HSV-specific memory CD8+ T cells from symptomatic (SYMP) patients (those who often develop recurrent ocular herpes) are mainly central memory T cells (TCM cells). (2) CD8+ T cells from ASYMP individuals, but not CD8+ T-cells from SYMP individuals, strongly recognize distinct and non-overlapping sets of epitopes from HSV-1 glycoproteins and tegument proteins, and vice versa. (3) Therapeutic immunization of latently infected HLA Tg rabbits with HSV-1 ASYMP CD8+ T cell epitopes boosted the number and function of HSV-specific CD8+ TEM and tissue- resident memory CD8 T cells (TRM cells) in TG and decreased spontaneous viral shedding in tears. (4) A significant proportion of CD8+ T cells in TG of non-protected HLA Tg rabbits expressed high levels of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitory receptors and appeared to be dysfunctional. (5) Topical ocular application of an AAV8 vector expressing the T-cell attracting chemokine CXCL10 pulled more CD8+ TEM and tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) into TG of HSV-1 latently infected HLA Tg rabbits and reduced virus shedding in tears. Building on these strong published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that increasing the number and function of anti- viral TG-resident TEM/TRM CD8+ T cells, by prime/pull immunotherapeutic vaccination combined with PD-1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoints blockade, should significantly decrease HSV spontaneous reactivation (as measured by shedding in tears). Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that therapeutic prime/pull vaccination of HSV-1 latently infected HLA Tg rabbits, using human HSV-1 CD8+ TEM/TRM cell epitopes (prime) and neurotropic AAV8 vectors expressing rabbit CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL5 T-cell-attracting chemokines (pull), will increase the number of TG-resident anti-viral CD8+ TEM/TRM cells and reduce HSV-1 spontaneous reactivation and virus shedding in tears. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that prime/pull therapeutic vaccination, together with blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoints will result in even more functional CD8 TEM/TRM cells in the TG, and produce a more robust protection against HSV-1 reactivation and virus shedding in tears. The prime/pull vaccine combined with immune checkpoints blockade is an innovative approach to treat blinding recurrent herpetic disease."
"9458701","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disease with an increasing prevalence. Although the etiology of AD is not completely understood, numerous studies suggest that impaired skin barrier function and immune dysregulation underlie the disease. We have developed novel allergen-inducible and spontaneous mouse models that mimic human AD: AD-like skin lesions induced by epicutaneous treatment with allergen require mast cells and the receptor for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). We found that phospholipase C (PLC)-?3-deficient mice spontaneously develop AD-like skin lesions with increased expression of TSLP and periostin in a mast cell-dependent manner; allergen-induced dermatitis was more severe in PLC-?3-/- than in wild-type mice. Gene expression profiles in lesional skin exhibited high similarity between allergen-induced dermatitis, spontaneous dermatitis in PLC-?3-/- mice, and human AD. We recently reported that PLC-?3 inhibits the proliferation of hematopoietic cells, including mast cells, through formation of the multi-molecular SPS complex containing SHP-1 (protein phosphatase), PLC-?3, and Stat5 (transcription factor); PLC-?3 interacts with SHP-1 and Stat5, augments the dephosphorylating activity of SHP-1 toward Stat5, and inhibits Stat5 activity. Stat5 and Jak2 (a Stat5-activating kinase) are essential for the development and proliferation of mast cells. Our preliminary data indicated the involvement of mast-cell Stat5 and SHP-1 in AD pathogenesis, as revealed by reduced or enhanced severity of allergen-induced dermatitis in mice with mast cell-specific deletion of Stat5 or SHP-1, respectively, as well as strong efficacy of a Jak-Stat5 inhibitor to prevent allergen-induced dermatitis. Moreover, human AD skin had increased numbers of mast cells with high activation levels of STAT5 and the genes encoding the SPS components were linked to the risk of human AD and/or its severity. These and other preliminary data have led to the following hypotheses: (1) The Stat5- regulatory pathway in mast cells plays a critical pathogenic role in AD. (2) SPS components regulate the activity of the cellular elements of the dermatitis-amplifying/perpetuating vicious cycle consisting of Th2 cytokines (mast cells), periostin (fibroblasts), and TSLP (keratinocytes). (3) The SPS components regulate not only mouse, but also human mast cell biology. Therefore, (Aim 1) using conditional knockout mice of SPS component genes as well as pharmacological approaches, we will further evaluate the role of the mast cell Stat5-regulatory pathway in development and persistence of dermatitis in PLC-?3-/- mice. (Aim 2) Using in vitro cultures and in vivo models, we will study how SPS components regulate Th2 cytokine production from mast cells, periostin production from fibroblasts, and TSLP production from keratinocytes. (Aim 3) Finally, we will study the role of SPS components in the growth, survival, and Fc?RI (high-affinity IgE receptor)-mediated activation of human mast cells and compare mast cells between human AD and healthy individuals. Overall, this project will likely establish a novel paradigm of AD pathogenesis and provide a novel therapeutic strategy."
"9552690","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Several candidate risk genes and genomic regions for schizophrenia (SZ) have been identified as well as numerous environmental risk factors. The etiology of SZ, however, remains unknown. Some of the environmental influences may act through epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation and histone modifications) which can alter gene expression by influencing functional DNA elements (e.g., promoters or enhancers), thus altering transcription. Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations are involved in the pathophysiology of SZ.  A deficiency in gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of affected individuals is one of the most consistent findings in SZ and has been reported in specimens from at least 10 different brain banks. This deficiency is present in a substantial proportion, but not all, individuals with SZ. We aim to explore the role of epigenetic alterations n this deficit. The GABAergic deficiency largely involves subpopulations of GABA interneurons that originate from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and express the calcium-binding proteins par albumin (PVALB) or somatostatin (SST). The mechanisms that lead to the molecular pathology of these interneurons are incompletely understood but appear to involve altered expression of ontogenetic transcription factors [e.g., SRY (Sex Determining Region Y)-Box 6 (SOX6)], which play a critical role in the specification, migration, and maturation of the MGE-derived GABA interneurons. We speculate that in the subset of individuals with SZ who exhibit a prefrontal GABAergic deficit, the deficit is mediated in part through epigenetic anomalies involving the MGE-derived GABA interneurons.  The proposed study in autopsy specimens is the first and necessary step in testing this epigenetic hypothesis. Specifically, we aim to characterize SZ-related differences in epigenetic marks in this particular cell population isolated from postmortem human brain. We have recently developed a fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based technique that provides excellent separation of neuronal (i.e., positive for the neuronal marker NeuN) nuclei from the postmortem brain into SOX6-positive and SOX6-negative subpopulations. The former population is highly enriched in PVALB- and SST-positive GABA interneurons, while the latter is mostly derived from glutamatergic (GLU) projection neurons. This methodological approach enables us to address epigenetic abnormalities in SZ that are specific for the MGE-derived GABA cells.  Our first aim is to perform genome-wide chromatin profiling of GABA and GLU neurons in the PFC from psychiatrically normal control individuals using DNA methylation and histone modification marks indicative of functional DNA cis regulatory elements (CREs) (i.e., enhancers and promoters). Our second aim is to identify epigenetic alterations in the CREs of MGE-derived cortical GABA interneurons in individuals with SZ. We will validate the functional importance of our epigenetic findings by determining which genes that are epigenetically altered in SZ also exhibit altered transcription.  The combination of technical innovation and multifaceted experimental design proposed in our work will advance fundamental neuroscience, and the resulting data will enhance our understanding of the cellular and molecular substrates of SZ. This may include the identification of epigenetic alterations that may be targeted in the future by novel therapeutic interventions. The proposed research may also provide important insights into the heterogeneity of molecular abnormalities underlying SZ which may correspond to the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations and therapeutic responses. This line of research, therefore, has the potential to contribute to enhanced personalized treatment selection in the future."
"9472250","PROJECT 2 - ABSTRACT Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a collection of clinical syndromes characterized by gradual, selective decline in speech and language functions. It is caused by neurodegeneration in the brain regions that sustain language. PPA is a devastating disease affecting adults in the prime of their life, depriving them of the ability to communicate and function in society. In the last decade, the cognitive and neural bases of PPA have been studied thoroughly, and three clinic-anatomical variants of the disease have been described. Importantly, each variant is characterized by a different probability of underlying frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Recent preliminary data suggest that different neurodevelopmental and biological factors are associated with each of the main PPA variants. In this project, we will further develop this line of research and investigate developmental, genetic and molecular factors that might determine susceptibility of the language network to each PPA subtype. We will recruit 125 new PPA patients and combine data with that of our large existing cohort to realize the following main goals: (1) Identify the presence of language-based learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, and determine their effect on cognitive and anatomical phenotypes. We hypothesize that language-based learning disabilities will be present most often in the logopenic variant PPA and will predict earlier age at onset and greater phonological impairment. (2) Measure hemispheric lateralization of language function an asses brain symmetry using magnetoencephalography and structural MRI. We predict that svPPA patients will show anomalous lateralization of language activation and decreased asymmetry of specific perisylvian language regions. (3) evaluate APOE allele status, inflammatory gene expression patterns and plasma cytokines levels. We expect to find a lower incidence of the APOE4 allele among logopenic patients with learning disabilities than those without, and to find biomarkers indicative of an altered immunological response in svPPA. This research will increase our knowledge about the pathogenesis of PPA and the neurobiology of language. Moreover, the results might serve as the foundation to develop early intervention strategies and personalized risk assessment for the prediction of neurodegenerative disease."
"9458112","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Caspase-1 activation by the inflammasomes is an important innate immune response to tissue damage and infection by microbial or viral pathogens. Caspase-1 is required for production of the active pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1? and IL-18, and is also important for pyroptosis or inflammatory cell death. The Nlrp3 inflammasome activates caspase-1 in response to diverse signals including infection with intracellular microbial and viral pathogens, TLR agonists combined with potassium-depleting agents or pore forming toxins, and crystalline and aggregated materials. Uncontrolled activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome can lead to a number of human diseases, including arthritis, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. Inherited mutations in Nlrp3 can also lead to a number of human autoinflammatory diseases or periodic fever syndromes. So far the mechanism of activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome by these seemingly unrelated stimuli is poorly understood. Studies in the applicant's laboratory demonstrated that Nlrp3 is rapidly primed by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling through a postranslational modification mechanism that depends on the TLR signaling molecules Myd88 and IRAK1. Additional preliminary evidence suggests that brief TLR signaling primes Nlrp3 by a redox- dependent mechanism, whereas prolonged TLR signaling suppresses inflammasome activation. In this renewal application specific aims are proposed to elucidate how the priming signal through TLR signaling contributes together with signaling from purinergic P2X7 receptor, pore forming toxins or crystalline materials towards the assembly of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, ASC oligomerization and caspase-1 activation. These aims will test the hypothesis that mtROS generation through TLR signaling or direct stimulation of mitochondrial respiratory complexes activates Nlrp3 by a redox-switch mechanism. Additional experiments will extend these findings and will also address alternative possibilities of Nlrp3 priming through IRAK1-dependent phosphorylation and whether the oxidation and phosphorylation mechanisms are interdependent. Experiments are also proposed to define the signaling pathways downstream of Toll-like receptors that mediate ROS production. Additional experiments will investigate how Nlrp3 inflammasome activity is negatively regulated in vitro and in vivo by prolonged TLR signaling, and the role of a number of cellular anti-inflammatory pathways, including autophagosomal and heme oxygenase-1 pathways in this negative regulatory mechanism. Results from this research will provide fundamental new insights into the mechanisms that regulate its activation and those that regulate its suppression. Successful completion of this study should have a high impact on the field by providing a unifying paradigm for how Nlrp3 can be regulated by an exceptionally diverse group of activating stimuli. Understanding these mechanisms is of great scientific and health significance as this should better our understanding of the molecular basis of Nlrp3-related diseases and should in the long term help in the development of therapeutics to alleviate these inflammatory diseases."

This proposal, which focuses on platelets, represents a productive collaboration between the Universities of Iowa and Utah. Our preliminary studies in the Framingham cohort and in pregnant humans, reveal increased platelet OPA1 levels in females, that predict risk of coronary artery disease, or correlate with increased platelet activation in the third trimester of pregnancy. In platelet-deficient OPA1 knockout (KO) mice we discovered that female OPA1KO mice were protected from thrombosis compared to males. The thrombosis phenotype was reversed after oophorectomy. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that OPA1 and regulators of OPA1 activity, OMA1 and YMEL1, modulate platelet activation in an estrogen-dependent manner and OPA1 levels in platelets predict estrogen modulated platelet activation. To address this hypothesis in the R61 phase, Aim 1 will determine the molecular mechanisms for estrogen-mediated and OPA-1-dependent modulation of platelet activation using mice with platelet specific OPA1 deletion and will generate OMA1 and YMEL1 platelet specific KO mice, with increased OPA1 activity. Aim 2 will determine platelet OPA1, OMA1, and YMEL1 expression and correlate expression levels to platelet activation in the setting of pregnancy and OCP use. We will also develop a human iPSC model system to generate MKs to determine if estrogen directly regulates the expression of these genes. The R33 phase will dissect the molecular mechanisms linking increased OPA1 with platelet activation in females. Aim 1 will perform detailed physiological and molecular phenotyping of murine platelets isolated from OMA1 and YMEL1 KO and OPA overexpressing transgenic mice. In addition, we will examine the mechanisms linking increased OPA1 activity, mitochondrial energetics and platelet activation. Aim 2 will complement animal studies by examining changes in mitochondrial function and signaling in platelets from pregnant women and women on OCPs. We will genetically ablate OMA1 and YMEL1 from iPSC-derived MKs to directly test if estrogen modulates MK and platelet function in an OPA1 dependent manner. By integrating in vivo and in vitro studies in humans and mouse models, our approach is translational, innovative and highly responsive to the RFA. These studies will determine for the first time whether increased estrogen exposure in pregnancy and OCP use reprogram MKs and developing platelets to increase thrombotic complications and identify novel mechanisms for this increased risk. The impact of these studies, is that they may identify novel biomarkers that may predict increased risk of thrombosis in susceptible females during pregnancy or prior to OCP use."
"9475301","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular differentiation is at a basic level a specification of the global protein complement, or proteome. The scale and speed of these changes are remarkable in the case of terminally differentiated cells such as erythrocytes, spermatozoa, and others. Global remodeling of the proteome consists of the programmed elimination of most generic constituents of the cell in parallel with abundant synthesis of a small number of new, cell-type-specific proteins such as globin. Reticulocytes are a canonical example of a proteome in rapid transition, yet, even in this case, the mechanisms that drive rapid turnover of normally stable proteins largely remain to be identified. We have found that Ube2O/E2-230K is an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme expressed selectively in the erythroid lineage and that null mutations in its gene have a highly specific phenotype of microcytic anemia. Further analysis of this murine mutant, hem9, suggests the hypothesis that Ube2O is a broad-spectrum ubiquitinating enzyme that plays a key role in the global remodeling of the erythroid proteome. To assess this model, an integrated set of approaches is proposed, incorporating mutant analysis, mass spectrometry, and in vitro biochemistry. A major point of focus will be to identify substrates of Ube2O in an unbiased and global manner. To date there has been significant progress towards this goal, as the globin chaperone AHSP, globin itself, and ribosomes have been provisionally assigned as Ube2O substrates. Accordingly, a distinctive phenotype of hem9 is markedly elevated levels of 80S ribosomes. In contrast, low ribosome levels are the signature feature of Diamond Blackfan anemia. Ube2O was found to be sufficient to induce ribosome degradation by dox-inducible expression in HEK293 cells; no other erythroid-specific factors are needed. The ubiquitination and degradation of AHSP and ribosomes will be reconstituted in vitro and in highly purified systems; the specificity determinants of these reactions will be mapped for both substrate and enzyme. In parallel with these biochemical investigations, the physiological effects of Ube2O loss will be studied at higher resolution through analysis of protein synthesis in the mutant reticulocytes, and bone marrow transplantation will be used to test whether hem9 erythroid phenotypes are cell-autonomous, as predicted by the hypothesis that Ube2O reshapes the proteome. Ultimately, our studies are expected to shed light on the fundamental process of proteome remodeling and provide new insights into underlying mechanisms of both microcytic anemia and Diamond Blackfan anemia."
"9552688","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Abstract Delayed Graft Function (DGF) refers to failure of a kidney to function optimally after transplantation. DGF is a serious clinical problem that independently predicts reduced 1- and 5- year kidney transplant survival. Prolonged Cold Ischemia (CI) of > 24 hours is a well-known risk factor for DGF, but the mechanism by which DGF occurs is not known. This proposal endeavors to determine how prolonged CI predisposes to DGF. Our published data demonstrate that mouse and porcine kidneys subjected to prolonged CI have increased caspase-3 and renal tubular epithelial cell (RTEC) apoptosis. We have developed a mouse kidney transplant model of DGF that demonstrates: (a) Prolonged CI alone results in RTEC apoptosis; (b) Prolonged CI followed by kidney transplant results in DGF, manifested by increased serum creatinine (sCr.), RTEC apoptosis and tubular necrosis (ATN); (c) Kidney transplant alone without CI results in neither RTEC apoptosis, ATN, nor DGF. Thus we propose to demonstrate the mechanisms by which RTEC apoptosis during prolonged CI predisposes to ATN and DGF.  Our preliminary data implicate X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) protein in caspase-3 mediated RTEC apoptosis during prolonged CI. Our preliminary data also demonstrate that prolonged CI of mouse RTEC in vivo and in vitro results in decreased XIAP, apoptosis, and release of high-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1), a ligand of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). HMGB1 binding of TLR4 activates RIP kinases - 1 and -3, which are serine/threonine protein kinases essential for cellular programmed necrosis. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that before kidney transplant, prolonged CI leads to RTEC apoptosis and release of HMGB1 from apoptotic nuclei to the cytoplasm, and into the interstitial space. We also hypothesize that after transplant of kidneys subjected to prolonged CI: (a) there is increased RTEC expression of TLR4; (b) TLR4 is activated by HMGB1; (c) TLR4 subsequently activates RIP kinases - 1 and -3 leading to ATN of other RTECs and DGF. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether upregulation or inhibition of XIAP has an effect on RTEC apoptosis, ATN, and sCr. in a mouse model of DGF. XIAP inhibition will be achieved by using either siRNA against XIAP or XIAP deficient mice. XIAP overexpression will be achieved by inhibition of HTRA2, a protein released from disrupted mitochondria that prevents the association of XIAP with caspase-3, thus causing RTEC apoptosis. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether upregulation or inhibition of HMGB1 has an effect on ATN and sCr. in a mouse model of DGF. HMGB1 inhibition will be achieved using HMGB1 neutralizing antibody. HMGB1 overexpression will be achieved using recombinant HMGB1. In Specific Aim 3 we will determine whether upregulation or inhibition of TLR4 has an effect on ATN and sCr.in a mouse model of DGF. TLR4 overexpression will be examined in wild-type kidneys transplanted after prolonged CI, and wild-type kidneys transplanted into TLR4 deficient syngeneic recipients. TLR4 inhibition will be achieved by; (a) an inhibitory antibody against TLR4; (b) transplanting TLR4 deficient kidneys into wild-type syngeneic recipients."
"9526729","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In US adults, there are large, unexplained racial disparities in hypertension (HTN), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. We propose to distinguish the relative contribution of sleep and circadian mechanisms to the increased risk for HTN in African American (Black) adults compared to European American (White) adults. The scientific premise for the proposed research, based partly on our recent work, is that both sleep and circadian mechanisms contribute to blood pressure (BP) regulation and HTN, and both sleep and circadian regulation differ between Black and White races. The innovation is to understand to what degree these sleep and circadian factors mechanistically explain this racial disparity in HTN. Recent work shows that Blacks have poorer sleep and a shorter circadian period, resulting in a tendency towards earlier sleep relative to circadian phase. BP usually decreases during sleep and this appears protective as there is an association between a <10% drop in the nocturnal vs. daytime BP (the so-called non-dipping BP) and more adverse CV events and mortality. Blacks have increased prevalence of this dangerous non-dipping 24-h BP fluctuation. Recently, we discovered a robust endogenous circadian rhythm in BP, unrelated to activity or sleep, with a circadian drop in BP across the biological night that likely contributes to nocturnal BP dipping. The diurnal variation in BP is the result of a summation of the effects on BP of varied behaviors across the day and night (e.g., sleep, waking up, exercise, other stresses) and the effects on BP of the circadian system. We plan to examine these interacting factors in 26 Black and 26 White adults, aged 40-60 years, to determine sleep and circadian mechanisms that may contribute to higher overall BP and reduced nocturnal drop in BP in Blacks. This will be achieved by using an intensive multi-day protocol where sleep-wake cycles are adjusted to 20-h so all behaviors occur evenly across all circadian phases while in a constant dim light (to avoid light resetting circadian phase). Sleep will be assessed with polysomnography and circadian phases by core body temperature. By studying standardized behaviors and regulators of BP during sleep and behavioral stresses across all circadian phases, this protocol will allow us to determine if the higher overall BP and reduced nocturnal drop in BP in Blacks compared to Whites is due to poor sleep, while controlling for circadian phase (Aim 1); reduced BP responses to standardized behavioral changes across the day and night (such as less reduction in BP during slow-wave sleep and/or reduced post-exercise hypotension; Aim 2); or reduced circadian amplitude of BP (Aim 3). Socioeconomic status and history of stress exposures will be adjusted for in all analyses. This study will be the first to distinguish the contributions of sleep, circadian and behavioral mechanisms to the non-dipping BP profile in Blacks and lay the groundwork for optimizing therapies dependent on mechanisms, such as targeting sleep, circadian rhythmicity, or behaviors, and raising the possibility that ideal therapy for HTN may differ by race. This research will ultimately help to improve health and survival in black populations with HTN."
"9457155","Project Summary/Abstract Consumption of a western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the epidemic of obesity and associated insulin resistance, hypertension and kidney disease that afflict our Veteran population. Chronic kidney disease is increasing despite widespread use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition and aggressive blood pressure control. Higher circulating aldosterone levels and excess mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation, prevalent in obese, insulin resistant individuals, may be driving the increased risk for progression of kidney disease, often in the face of adequate blood pressure control. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis plays a major role in the development and progression of kidney disease. What little is known about MR activation in tubulointerstitial fibrosis has been extrapolated from vascular studies where the development of endothelial cell stiffness can be directly related to reductions in bioavailable nitric oxide (NO). Lowered NO levels activate transglutaminase 2 (TG2) known to promote the extracellular matrix remodeling, synthesis of fibrotic products and macrophage infiltration that lead to fibrosis. My pilot data indicate that consumption of a WD promotes MR activation resulting in lower endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, cell stiffness, macrophage infiltration, a shift to an inflammatory M1/M2 polarization and vascular fibrosis. Preliminary data link activation of the endothelial cell MR and TG2 activation but the role of endothelial MR activation and its regulation of eNOS and TG2 in tubulointerstitial fibrosis remain to be determined. In this context, the Objectives have been designed to investigate the mechanisms by which over-nutrition promotes tubulointerstitial fibrosis through the endothelial aldosterone/MR system. We posit that the endothelial MR regulates bioavailable NO and TG2, leading to stiffness and immune system activation. We will use a high fat/sugar/salt diet (WD) known to activate the aldosterone/MR system and an endothelial-cell specific MR knockout mouse (ECMR-/-) model to more specifically implicate the endothelial MR in tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Fibrosis will be determined by light and electron microscopy, expression of fibrotic markers and magnetization transfer MRI. To address Objective 1, I will measure endothelial cell stiffness using atomic force microscopy, vascular reactivity using intravital microscopy, and resistance using ultrasound imaging. To address Objective 2, I will focus on monocyte chemotaxis and M? polarization through FACS and flow cytometry analysis of immune markers and M2 polarization along with other measures of inflammation, such as cytokine expression. Objective 3 has been designed to investigate the importance of MR-, NO-, and TG2-dependent actions on kidney fibrosis. I will employ a NO-donor and/or a TG2 inhibitor and measure oxidative, inflammatory, extracellular cross-linking enzymes and fibrotic pathways to gauge molecular responses to the interventions. These results will be correlated to the degree of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and endothelial cell stiffness (Objective 1) and monocyte chemotaxis and M? polarization (Objective 2). In summary, results from these studies will define a heretofore unknown link between activation of the endothelial cell MR and the contribution of this activation to the inflammatory response and endothelial cell stiffness and tubulointerstitial fibrosis seen in obesity (Objectives 1 and 2). Detailed exploration of the mechanisms of ECMR regulation of NO and TG2 (Objective 3) will allow identification of newer targets for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies to prevent/interrupt progression of kidney disease."
"9541498","Project Summary Drug addiction is a debilitating disorder that affects ~25 million Americans?ages 12 and up?with treatment costs averaging >$190 billion annually in the United States alone. Drug abuse is characterized by loss of control over drug intake, as well as persistent drug-seeking behaviors, despite negative consequences to both the drug abuser and those directly affected by their behavior. Given that drug addicts continue to crave and pursue drugs of abuse following extended periods of abstinence and/or treatment indicates that there must be life-long changes that occur in brain to promote these behavioral phenotypes. Persistent changes in neuronal gene expression are known to promote physiological alterations implicated in drug addiction. More recently, cell-type and brain region specific epigenetic mechanisms have also been demonstrated to regulate transcriptional programs contributing to addiction-like behaviors; however, our understanding of how these mechanisms mediate life-long addiction remains limited. Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system plays a critical role in psychostimulant-induced neural plasticity, with alterations in dopamine production/function being implicated in both the development and treatment of substance abuse disorders. Although packaging of dopamine by the vesicular monoamine transporter is essential for numerous aspects of reward, recent data have demonstrated the additional presence of `reserve' pools of extravesicular monoamines in the nucleus of monoamine producing neurons. Dopamine, as well as other monoamines, have previously been shown to form covalent bonds with certain cytoplasmic proteins catalyzed by the tissue Transglutaminase 2 enzyme. Dr. Maze's laboratory has recently identified histone proteins as robust substrates for dopaminylation in vivo, specifically on histone 3 glutamine 5 (H3Q5dop). Furthermore, our preliminary data, collected under the co-mentorship of Dr. Kenny, demonstrate that chronic withdrawal from volitional administration of extended access to cocaine in rodents results in high levels of dopamine accumulation in the nucleus of dopamine producing neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as altered expression of Tgm2, the H3 dopaminylase. In this proposal, I will therefore investigate potential roles for H3Q5dop in cocaine-induced transcriptional plasticity in VTA via a combination of next generation sequencing approaches (Aim 1). Next, I will utilize novel viral-mediated techniques to overexpress or inhibit H3Q5dopaminylation in this region to directly investigate functions for histone dopaminylation in cocaine- seeking behaviors (Aim 2). Taken together, these potentially paradigm-shifting studies will aid in our understanding as to how monoamines, specifically dopamine, function in brain to regulate neurotransmission independent neuronal plasticity and cocaine-mediated behaviors. !"

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This is an application for a Career Development Award (CDA-2) for Dr. John Greenland, a staff physician in the Pulmonary and Critical Care Section of the San Francisco VA Medical Service who is establishing himself as an investigator in patient-oriented research into the immunology of lung transplantation. This CDA-2 award will provide Dr. Greenland with the necessary support to accomplish the following goals: (1) to improve the understanding of predictors of chronic lung rejection, (2) to acquire theoretical and practical skills in bioinformatics and advanced T cell immunology, (3) to establish the mechanistic foundations for future interventional trials to improve post-lung transplant surveillance, and (4) to establish an independent clinical research career focused on lung transplantation immunology. To achieve these goals, Dr. Greenland has assembled a mentoring team consisting of (1) primary mentor Dr. George Caughey, an internationally respected authority in pulmonary immunology with a track record of mentoring translational researchers, (2) Dr. David Daikh, a recognized translational T cell immunologist, (3) Dr. Qizhi Tang, an expert in human transplant immunology; and (4) Dr. Jeffrey Golden, who has over 25 years of experience with clinical research in lung transplantation. Additionally, he will benefit from tutorials and mentorship from Drs. Nick Jewell, Scott Boyd, and Kirk Jones, in biostatistics, bioinformatics, and pathology, respectively; and research support from Drs. Lewis Lanier and Mark Ansel. The proposed research expands on Dr. Greenland's recently published findings that lymphocytic bronchitis (LB) on post-lung transplant surveillance biopsy predicts the development of chronic rejection in the form of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). The proposed study will establish a prospective cohort of lung transplant recipients to achieve the following specific aims: (1) determine the phenotype and specificity of infiltrating T cells in LB, (2) assess regulatory, humoral, and innate lymphocyte responses during LB, and (3) prospectively assess LB as a predictor of BOS. These studies will make use of next-generation flow cytometry and sequencing techniques to characterize immune responses in peripheral blood, airway brushings and biopsies, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients undergoing post-transplant surveillance bronchoscopy. A better understanding of LB may allow it to become an important biomarker for the development of BOS, while understanding LB in the context of the post-lung transplantation donor-specific immune response will lead to new tools for optimizing immunosuppression and inducing tolerance."

"9457328","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIAMS K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award application outlines the career development plan and research training activities that will facilitate Dr. Alayna Loiselle's development in to a successful independent investigator in the field of diabetic tendinopathy. Drs. Hani Awad, Edward Schwarz and Robert Mooney will provide mentorship and training to enhance Dr. Loiselle's expertise in basic tendon biology and the impact of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on tendon homeostasis and repair. Together we have created an integrated training plan that incorporates didactic training focused on tendon biology, T2DM and insulin receptor (IR) signaling, as well as professional development training in grantsmanship, and laboratory management; research training will include the use of cutting-edge imaging to assess collagen organization during disease progression, the use of complex mouse genetic models which will answer fundamental questions regarding the cell populations involved in flexor tendon (FT) homeostasis and repair, and the function of IR signaling in these processes. We have also established clear hallmarks of success for each training component. This program will be used to test the overall hypothesis that loss of IR signaling in FT cells results in suppressed matrix remodeling and increased fibrosis in diabetic tendons. This hypothesis is based on our preliminary data, which demonstrates suppressed IR signaling in T2DM tendons, concurrent with loss of FT gliding function and impairments in strength. These pathological tendon changes in the murine model of T2DM recapitulate the changes that are seen clinically as part of the `diabetic hand syndrome' in which FTs become fibrotic and are unable to smoothly glide through the synovial sheath. Impaired FT gliding impedes flexion of the fingers, which can compromise the function of the entire hand. In addition, diabetic tendons are more prone to rupture, which further complicates the already challenging repair of FTs; up to 40% of non-diabetic FT repairs heal with significant complications including the formation of adhesions between the tendon and synovial sheath, resulting in loss of gliding function. Healing is further impaired in diabetic patients, indicating the need to understand the cellular and molecular changes in both disrupted FT homeostasis and impaired healing in T2DM in order to identify novel therapeutic approaches to restore FT function in this rapidly expanding patient population. In the present study we will define the effects of T2DM on FT homeostasis and healing, and identify attenuated IR signaling as the primary mechanism of diabetic tendinopathy. We will also use ex-vivo and in vitro approaches to identify suppression of matrix metalloproteinase activity as a mechanism of impaired matrix remodeling and tendon fibrosis. This training program will provide Dr. Loiselle with intensive training in the effects of T2DM on tendon, but will also result in the generation of novel preliminary data, which will act as a platform for Dr. Loiselle's future research program focused on translational approaches to maintaining FT function and improving healing in the context of T2DM."
"9460510","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of blindness among working-age U.S. adults despite the fact that major NEI clinical trials show that early detection and treatment reduce the risk of severe vision loss by 90%. Adherence with yearly diabetic retinopathy screening guidelines in the U.S has stagnated at 50%. Ocular telemedicine (i.e. tele-ophthalmology) can be highly effective for increasing diabetic retinopathy screening rates, but there is very limited utilization of these programs in multi-payer health systems, which constitute the majority of U.S. healthcare systems. Significant barriers exist to the successful application of tele-ophthalmology, but these barriers are poorly understood. Dr. Liu's K23 research plan aims to (1) identify primary care provider and patient-level barriers and facilitators to tele-ophthalmology screening for diabetic retinopathy in a rural, multi-payer healt system, (2) develop an implementation package to overcome those barriers at a single primary care site, and (3) pilot-test the impact of this implementation package on diabetic retinopathy screening rates at multiple primary care clinics. She hypothesizes that this implementation package, structured upon well-established frameworks for increasing adherence with diabetes care guidelines and healthcare process improvement, will successfully integrate tele-ophthalmology into the existing healthcare system, and will both achieve and maintain increased diabetic retinopathy screening rates.  Dr. Liu's long-term career goal is to reduce vision loss in underserved communities by expanding access to eye care through ocular telemedicine. Her proposed mentored research and training would provide the further skills needed to become an independent investigator in ophthalmic health services delivery with additional expertise in the emerging field of dissemination and implementation science. She will access a wealth of resources through the University of Wisconsin, including accomplished NIH-funded mentors and collaborators in the multidisciplinary fields of telemedicine, epidemiology, mixed methods (i.e. qualitative and quantitative), dissemination and implementation, industrial/systems engineering, and health services research. This K23 proposal directly responds to multiple elements of the National Eye Institute's (NEI) Health Disparities Strategic Plan and National Plan for Eye and Vision Research (NPEVR). These include areas of emphasis in health services research, diabetic retinopathy, and expanding access to rural, underserved populations. The NEI Health Disparities Strategic Plan states that telemedicine has great potential to reduce access disparities and the NPEVR calls to expand efforts in telemedicine to manage diabetic retinopathy...for rural and/or underserved populations. By understanding how to effectively integrate and utilize ocular telemedicine in multi-payer health systems, Dr. Liu's research will facilitate the effective translation of telemedicine technology ino improved diabetic retinopathy screening rates in the community. Building from this work, she plans to develop future telemedicine screening and management protocols for other major causes of visual disability such as uncorrected refractive error, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. Advancements in ocular telemedicine have the potential to provide unparalleled access to eye care for millions of Americans and the effective translation of these technologies will be critical both for addressing health disparities as well as to meet the growing needs of our aging population."
"9443853","ABSTRACT For the past decade, several lines of evidence have shown a direct role for oxidative stress in the pathology of schizophrenia (SZ). Although peripheral changes associated with oxidative stress may be useful to establish biomarkers for the disease, connecting such peripheral changes to brain dysfunction has not yet been fully established. Furthermore, there is a need to develop high throughput assays for measuring such peripheral changes. We recently found that oxidative stress-associated endogenous autofluorescence (AF) is aberrantly augmented in SZ cells. AF is regulated by the GAPDH stress cascade, and the extent of AF is negatively correlated with cognitive flexibility evaluated by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Meanwhile, we have recently found that the selectively activated GAPDH stress cascade in microglia in the prefrontal cortex is likely to mediate cognitive inflexibility in an oxidative stress-associated mouse model. We have observed that expression of Cd11b (a key factor for microglia to target to synapse) is regulated by the GAPDH stress cascade in this mouse model. Based on these promising preliminary data, we hypothesize that activation of the GAPDH stress cascade and associated altered AF triggers pathological changes in microglia, which in turn affects synaptic connectivity in the prefrontal cortex that underlies cognitive flexibility. To address this hypothesis, we propose the following three aims: 1) to establish a high throughput assay that measures cellular AF from human blood samples; 2) to identify specific cognitive domain(s) that is correlated with and predicted by augmented AF in blood cells; and 3) to identify a molecular mechanism by which the GAPDH stress cascade mediates cognitive inflexibility in an oxidative stress-associated animal model. Through these three Aims, we seek the translational potential of intervening in the GAPDH stress cascade to ameliorate cognitive deficits by using AF in blood cells as an objective high throughput marker."
"9462142","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy and the leading cause of blindness, affecting over 3 million people in the United States. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a well-known risk factor for this disease, but reduced ocular perfusion is also now appreciated to be an important risk factor in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form of glaucoma. While optical methods such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have made great strides in imaging the retina, its constituent layers (including the all-important nerve fiber layer in glaucoma) and recently even the choroid and lamina cribrosa, OCT penetration is limited beyond a 1 mm depth. OCT cannot adequately penetrate the anterior sclera for imaging of or assessment of perfusion in the ciliary body, whose epithelium is responsible for aqueous fluid production and is hence the target for some medical treatments for control of IOP. OCT cannot image the orbital vessels supplying the eye. Although ultrasound has lower resolution than OCT, it has far greater penetration. High-frequency ultrasound is able to visualize the ciliary body in detail while Doppler studies at lower frequencies enable assessment of orbital blood flow. A major impediment to the adoption of ultrasound for ocular blood-flow imaging has been the stringent exposure criteria established by the Food and Drug Administration, the most conservative for any organ, including pre-natal scanning. Recently, a linear array based ultrasound technique called coherent compound plane-wave imaging has been developed that offers not only an enormous increase in image frame rate, but also allows imaging of anatomy and perfusion at significantly reduced exposure intensities. To better understand the link between glaucoma and perfusion and, ultimately, develop methods that could have a significant clinical impact, we seek to utilize coherent compound plane-wave imaging to assess perfusion in POAG. We will develop and utilize this technology to assess orbital blood supply (at 10 MHz), choroidal and optic nerve perfusion (at 20 MHz) and the ciliary body (at 30 MHz). We propose to use the Verasonics Vantage 128 imaging engine, which is user-programmable, to produce anatomic and color-flow images in conjunction with measurement of IOP and retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell complex thickness distributions and optic nerve head measures obtained by OCT and visual fields. Perfusion in each region will be compared between POAG and age-matched normal subjects. We will also characterize perfusion, especially in the ciliary body, pre- and post- medical therapy. Regional perfusion will be assessed statistically as a risk factor for progression of visual field loss. At he end of this project, we will have a better understanding of the role of perfusion in POAG and will have developed a clinically safe, acceptable and diagnostically significant system for assessment of glaucoma with ultrasound-derived perfusion imaging of the choroid, optic nerve, orbital vessels and ciliary body."
"9517276","ABSTRACT Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. RCC is highly resistant to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy; and therapeutic benefits with immunotherapeutic strategies are not remarkable. Aberrant signaling through Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) plays a major role in renal tumor growth. In both clear cell and papillary RCC, the RTK c-Met is hyperactive; and plays an important role in conferring resistance to targeted therapies. In our recent study, we have demonstrated that HGF/c-Met- mediated signaling activated Ras/Raf/PI3K pathway and down-regulated renal cancer cells apoptosis; and it was associated with the overexpression of cytoprotective heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). We have also observed that siRNA-mediated silencing of HO-1 significantly decreased the c-Met-induced inhibition of renal cancer cell apoptosis. A small molecule c-Met inhibitor (Cabozantinib/XL-184) has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced RCC. However, reports suggest that acquired drug resistance to c-Met inhibition through gene mutations and chromosome amplification, and dose-dependent toxicity are major hurdles in the use of Cabozantenib/XL-184; and can potentially subdue the anti-tumor effects of c-Met inhibitor therapy. Therefore, targeting c-Met along with its potent downstream effector molecule(s) can overcome the aforementioned hurdles. One such potential target can be Renalase (RNLS), a secreted flavoprotein from renal tissues in response to hypoxia and tissue injury. RNLS, through its amine oxidase function, modulates systemic blood pressure. Independent of its intrinsic enzymatic activity, recent reports suggest that RNLS and its receptor PMCA4b-mediated signaling activates MAPK and PI3K pathways to mediate cytoprotection; and it is markedly increased in tumor tissues and can serve as a prognostic marker. Kidney tissues are the predominant source of RNLS; yet, the role of RNLS in the growth and survival of renal cancer cells has not been studied. In our preliminary studies, we found that RNLS is overexpressed in renal cancer cells and HGF treatment further increased the expression of RNLS; and inhibition of c-Met (using XL-184) decreased the level of RNLS expression in these cells. We hypothesized that RNLS, in addition to promoting tumorigenic pathways independently, can also serve as one of the effector molecules for c-Met-induced growth of renal tumors. Thus, the over-expressed RNLS can significantly augment c-Met-mediated signaling axis to promote tumor growth. Through this proposal, we will bring-forth the pro-tumorigenic role of RNLS in RCC and identify the previously unrecognized role for c-Met activation in increasing the expression of RNLS in cancer cells. We will explore the efficacy of targeting both c-Met and RNLS in restricting renal tumor growth in vivo. We will generate significant data to support the potential therapeutic benefit of co-targeting c-MET and RNLS in restricting renal tumor growth; and this should have a major impact in the treatment of RCC."
"9664994","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of our T32 grant entitled is to rigorously train clinically oriented post-doctoral scholars from both adult and pediatric backgrounds in clinical investigation focused on prevention and treatment of kidney disease. The training program strives to supplying the workforce with outstanding clinical investigators in adult and pediatric nephrology who will lead the field in discovery of new treatments and preventive strategies for the expanding population of adult and pediatric kidney disease patients throughout their careers. The training will be provided through four structured modules, supplemented by elective coursework, seminars, and individual mentoring. The first module provides a 2-year mentored primary research project, supervised by a T32 faculty member and a 3-faculty Scholar Oversight Committee created individually for each scholar. This T32 places a strong emphasis on training in epidemiology and biostatistics, which will assist scholars regardless of their primary focus within clinical investigation. Thus, in the second module, all scholars will complete the UCSD CREST program; a highly rated and successful two-year Master's program in clinical research that is specifically designed to train clinically oriented scholars in research methods. Understanding the key aspects to measurement, including topics such as precision, limits of detection, and different platforms of measurement are key tools in clinical investigation. Moreover, skills to test the kidney's ability to metabolize and clear compounds will be necessary if scholars are to deliver new treatments to kidney disease patients. Thus, the third module is designed to provide the scholar hands-on experiences with in vivo pharmacology and measurement methods in both animal models and in humans. Finally, success in investigative careers requires skills in scientific writing, grantsmanship, and leadership; structured training i these areas is often overlooked. Thus, the fourth module will provide structured training in these areas. In proposing a new T32, we have specifically designed this grant with a modest request of post-doctoral fellow positions. We request 2 slots in year 1 and 3 slots in subsequent years. One in every 3 scholars will be trained in pediatric nephrology. Recognizing the importance of strong commitment of our faculty to a new T32, we have prioritized the quality and breadth of expertise of faculty, rather than quantity of faculty. The faculty was selected based on their commitment to clinical investigation, commitment to mentorship, and breadth of expertise in all aspects of clinical investigation spanning from physiology and pharmacology in animal models to clinical trials in humans. The scholar and faculty are supported by the great wealth of expertise of the larger faculty at UCSD which will be used to supplement needs of individual scholars. In aggregate, we propose an innovative, supportive environment for outstanding training in all aspects required for successful careers in clinical investigation in adult and pediatric nephrology."
"9457431","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal investigates the underlying causes of human ocular diseases using mouse models, focusing on both the Notch signaling pathway, which is broadly required during development, and two classes of bHLH transcription factors (Atoh7/Neurog2 or Hes genes). The activities of both types of factors are regulated by Notch signaling, in particular developmental contexts. The Notch pathway is also responsible for regulating cell proliferation, morphogenesis, differentiation, apoptosis and stem cell maintenance. Dominant mutations in the human Notch pathway genes JAG1 and NOTCH2 cause Alagille syndrome, in which some patients exhibit eye deformities. This proposal will use complex conditional (cre-lox) mouse strains, including double and triple mutants, histology, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, in situ hybridization, mouse embryology, flow cytometry, NEXTgen sequencing, bioinformatics, ChIP, qPCR, and PCR technologies to address basic, mechanistic questions about retinal neuron formation. We will address two important questions, namely 1) Which genes regulate optic nerve head development and maintain the boundary between the retina and optic stalk? 2) What controls retinal progenitor cell differentiation into either a retinal ganglion cell or a cone photoreceptor neuron?"
"9552693","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Gulf War Veterans illness (GWVI) refers to the complex of chronic symptoms that preferentially affect Veterans of the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War, with the most debilitating symptoms being those that rob the Veteran of his or her personal identity, i.e., symptoms that affect the brain an result in acquired cognitive and neuropsychological dysfunction (AC&ND). An established concept in clinical neuroscience is that some forms of AC&ND are caused by chronic TLR4-mediated neuroinflammation. Gulf War Veterans were exposed to a specific combination of risk factors that are not usually encountered in the general population or in non-deployed military personnel, which we speculate could have been responsible for TLR4-mediated neuroinflammation leading to AC&ND. First, warfighters deployed to the Persian Gulf were exposed to many potential neurotoxicants, most importantly the classic pro-inflammatory Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Middle East sand-dust particles contain exceptionally high levels of LPS. During sand storms, especially high levels of LPS would be delivered to the olfactory mucosa, which is increasingly recognized as a direct portal of entry into the brain. Secondly, warfighters deployed to the Persian Gulf were exposed to pyridostigmine, a long-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that was used daily as prophylaxis against nerve gas. Based on new data from our laboratory, which suggest that pyridostigmine augments entry into the brain of LPS delivered to the olfactory mucosa, we speculate that the combined exposures to olfactory LPS plus oral pyridostigmine might have resulted in marked TLR4-mediated neuroinflammation leading to AC&ND typical of GWVI. OBJECTIVE: We have two specific aims (SA): In SA1, using male and female rats, we will evaluate the effect of low-dose paranasal sinus LPS, alone vs. with oral pyridostigmine, on the severity and persistence of neuroinflammation and resulting neurofunctional abnormalities. These experiments will yield a detailed characterization of our model of GWVI (olfactory LPS plus oral pyridostigmine), and will demonstrate the multiplicative role of pyridostigmine on olfactory LPS. In SA2, using our model of GWVI in male and female rats, we will evaluate the effect of treatment, after disease onset, with a PPAR? agonist, Rosiglitazone, on neuroinflammation (CSF and plasma biomarkers, and tissue inflammation), microstructural/metabolic MRI changes, and neurofunctional abnormalities. METHODS: We will use a rat model to examine the CNS effects of the neurotoxicants, low-dose paranasal sinus LPS plus oral pyridostigmine administered continuously for 4 or 8 weeks. Rats will be implanted with mini-osmotic pumps to deliver LPS into the paranasal sinus, and will have pyridostigmine in their drinking water. Neurofunctional abnormalities will be assessed using: Elevated Plus Maze, open field exploration, novel object recognition, Morris Water Maze (incremental and rapid spatial learning), tail suspension test, and forced swim test. Inflammatory cytokines in CSF and plasma will be measured using a multiplex system. Tissue neuroinflammation will be examined using immunohistochemistry. Microstructural and metabolic changes will be studied non-invasively using diffusion kurtosis imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Preliminary Findings: Strong preliminary data support this project. Status: This is a new project. Impact: Successful completion of this project will shed new light on the potential involvement of olfactory LPS plus oral pyridostigmine as a root cause of GWVI, and on the role of chronic indolent systemic inflammation in causing symptoms of AC&ND. Our studies provide a new direction for GWVI research, and may aid in developing novel therapies for reversing AC&ND associated with GWVI."

"9551502","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are common in many metabolic disorders such Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. In these chronic conditions, there is a decreased responsiveness to endogenous insulin (insulin resistance). The decreased responsiveness to insulin results in a reduction in insulin- regulated glucose disposal, which occurs mostly in skeletal muscle. Acute insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are much less studied, but are characteristic metabolic responses to infections and injuries such as surgery, burns, trauma and hemorrhage.  Recent data suggests that intensive insulin treatment of ICU patients may reduce both morbidity and mortality associated with critical illness. However, there is some controversy concerning the proper use of intensive insulin therapy, and under what conditions it can do the most good, or conversely when it is unnecessary or harmful. Intensive insulin therapy increases the likelihood of deleterious hypoglycemic incidents, a major complication of intensive insulin therapy. Even though intensive insulin therapy is now extensively used in the ICU, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the acute onset of insulin resistance. For instance, how quickly it develops, what are the causative factors, what intracellular signaling pathways are affected, and what tissues are involved. An understanding of how this insulin resistance develops will be important in determining the proper application of intensive insulin therapy, the most advantageous time for initiation following different injuries, and may suggest new treatment protocols to increase survival of critically ill patients. For instance, is therapy to reuce insulin resistance more advantageous to the patient than intensive insulin therapy? And what tissue or tissues need to be targeted?  Insulin resistance can be explained by changes in the number of insulin receptors or their activity, or a post- receptor defect. Our recently published and preliminary data indicate that there are insulin receptors and post-receptor defects in insulin signaling that develop in skeletal muscle following surgical trauma and hemorrhage. The data suggests an important role for the glucocorticoids and proinflammatory cytokines, but how they interact to cause the initial development of insulin resistance is unknown. Additional preliminary data indicate that the mechanisms of the development of insulin resistance are different in the three main insulin target tissues, skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. This makes it necessary to study each tissue separately, to determine how this insulin resistance occurs. In addition, there are time-dependent changes in the factors that maintain the insulin resistant state. We have also found these to be tissue dependent. These results may be clinically advantageous, allowing us to specifically target individual tissues with treatments less likely tha intensive insulin therapy to cause hypoglycemic incidents, and more likely to achieve the proper range of blood glucose levels in patients in the ICU.  Thus, studies are proposed in this application to determine the mechanism(s) of the development of acute insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Also, much of this application is designed to study the mechanisms of recovery of insulin sensitivity following resuscitation. Potential clinical treatments are explored that may work to reverse the mortality and morbidity related to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in the critical care setting following injury, infection and critical illness."
"9457460","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Convergence insufficiency (CI), a prevalent binocular vision disorder in adults and children, is characterized by greater exophoria at near than at distance, reduced fusional convergence amplitude, receded near point of convergence, and a reduced accommodative convergence over accommodation ratio (AC/A). CI is associated with symptoms that include double/blurred vision, eyestrain, and headaches when engaged in reading or other near work, thus interfering with activities of daily living. The recent NEI/NIH multi-center randomized clinical trial, the Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (CITT), demonstrated the effectiveness of Office-Based Vergence and Accommodative Therapy with home reinforcement (OBVAT) for CI, reporting 73% of patients have sustained improvements of vision function and symptoms. Our team published the first fMRI neural substrate data evoked using convergence eye movements in CI patients before and then post- OBVAT. Our results support that with the reduction of visual symptoms, the following were observed: 1) an increase in the percent signal change of functional activity in the frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex and the cerebellar vermis, 2) an increase in convergence peak velocity, 3) a decrease in the near point of convergence, 4) an increase in positive fusional amplitude, and 5) a reduction in the amount of exophoria at near.5 The aims of our current proposal are to test the following two hypotheses as potential underlying mechanisms of CI that may be improved post OBVAT: 1) a reduced ability to adapt vergence in near and far space via the 'slow' component of vergence and 2) a reduced ability to quickly diminish disparity error via the 'fast' component of vergence. Not only will our quantitative methods integrated with established CITT standards address important questions about potential mechanisms causing CI, our proposal seeks to identify how a validated vergence therapy may remediate symptoms. Our proposal will determine whether either of these two potential mechanisms are causing CI by quantifying the following: 1) rate and magnitude of phoria adaptation, 2) forced vergence fixation disparity curves, 3) peak velocity of convergence eye movements (studying visual cues such as disparity, accommodation and proximal stimuli in isolation and combination), and 4) the functional activity of the fast and slow vergence neural substrates prior to, and then after, OBVAT. The assembled study team is particularly knowledgeable in terms of OBVAT, convergence insufficiency, optometry, vision science, oculomotor research, functional imaging, modeling and statistics with the necessary resources to successfully complete both aims of this study. Results from our project's aims can lead to targeted treatments with improved success rates, potentially reducing the time to remediate symptoms, and ultimately reducing health care costs."
"9505590","Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high ?cost,? with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as ?response shift.? We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes."
"9462129","Accurate perception of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the environment is essential to daily function. 3D vision requires the brain to reconstruct the depth structure of the environment from the sequence of 2D retinal images arriving at the eyes. Most of our knowledge about the neural mechanisms of 3D vision is limited to the case of stationary observers viewing static surfaces; in contrast, objects typically move in depth and observers often need to judge 3D scene structure while they are also moving. To arrive at a deeper understanding of how the brain computes depth under dynamic viewing conditions, we need to elucidate the mechanisms by which visual neurons compute the motion of objects in depth, as well as the neural computations that underlie perception of depth from motion parallax cues that arise during self- motion. We propose a series of experiments that take important steps toward this more general understanding of the neural basis of depth perception. Aim #1 examines the mechanisms by which neurons signal motion-in-depth via binocular cues. Recent work established that neurons in area MT signal motion-in-depth based on both interocular velocity differences and changing disparity cues, but the mechanisms of this selectivity remain unknown. Aim #2 examines how global patterns of rotational optic flow resulting from observer movement are used by the brain to interpret depth from motion parallax. We hypothesize that these ?dynamic perspective? cues are encoded by neurons in area MSTd with very large receptive fields, and that these neurons also carry integrated efference copy signals regarding eye rotation. Aim #3 examines how extra- retinal signals related to eye and body rotation are combined and used to compute depth from motion parallax. At both neural and behavioral levels, we test a specific theoretically-motivated hypothesis for how eye and body rotation signals should be integrated to compute depth. A major strength of the proposed work is that it rigorously explores the interaction of multiple visual and extra-retinal signals in tightly-controlled experiments with clear theoretical predictions. The proposed research is directly relevant to the research priorities of the Strabismus, Amplyopia, and Visual Processing program at the National Eye Institute."

"9451300","PROJECT SUMMARY Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD) is a dominantly inherited, degenerative disease of the macula that is characterized by bilateral loss of central vision as a consequence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Specific mutations in the TIMP-3 gene involving exon 5 or the intron4-exon5 boundary have been shown to be causative. Early this year, the AMD consortium identified rare coding variants in the TIMP3 gene when analyzing 16,144 patients and 17,832 controls. In addition, they identified the first genetic association signal specific to wet AMD near MMP9. The clinical and histopathological similarities between AMD and SFD and the identification of variants in the matrix metalloproteinase pathway in AMD suggest that similar downstream effectors might be in play in both conditions. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the CNV in SFD will provide information that could be potentially useful in AMD. In comparative studies using TIMP-3 deficient mice, S156CTIMP-3 transgenic mice and in vitro culture experiments we have determined that TIMP-3 partially inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the binding of VEGF to VEGR-2. S156C TIMP-3 mutant protein induces angiogenesis via VEGF and bFGF. We have also shown that the absence of functional TIMP-3 results in an accumulation of hyaluronan that regulates choroidal vasculature. Based on these results, we hypothesize that TIMP3 is required to control and localize matrix degradation in the RPE/choroid, and loss of TIMP3 function in this regards leads to an abnormality in growth factor/angiogenesis factor, increased HA signaling and neovascularization."
"9603922","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) affects more than 10 million people in the U.S. and accounts for nearly half of liver cirrhosis-associated deaths. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is necessary to develop new therapies, which are currently quite limited. The innate immune system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ALD. Macrophages (M?) is a major type of cells of the innate immunity, and has emerged as a critical player and therapeutic target in many chronic inflammatory diseases. Evidence suggests that hepatic M? s are important in the development and progression of ALD. In patients and animal models, increased numbers of hepatic M? are found in all stages of ALD, and factors indicating M? activation are elevated. Hepatic M? s are a heterogeneous population with diverse phenotype and functions. Aside from resident Kupffer cells (KCs), we recently discovered that chronic ethanol feeding to mice causes the hepatic recruitment of infiltrating M? s (IMs), which consist of a pro-inflammatory Ly6Chi subset and an anti- inflammatory, tissue-protective Ly6Clow subset. Phagocytosis of dead cells (efferocytosis) promotes the switching of Ly6Chi IMs to Ly6Clow IMs. Moreover, we found that hepatic M? s from gp91phox-/- mice have impaired efferocytosis ability. Interestingly, compared with ethanol-fed WT mice, the ratio of Ly6Chi/Ly6Clow IMs, as well as the degree of liver injury, are significantly higher in gp91phox-/- mice. These results led to our hypothesis that gp91phox, through regulating M? efferocytosis, plays a critical role in the programming of tissue- restorative hepatic M? s, thereby protecting the liver from ALD. We propose two Specific Aims to examine this hypothesis: (Aim 1), Investigate the protective role of gp91phox in ethanol-induced liver inflammation and injury. The degrees of liver injury and inflammation will be compared between WT and gp91phox-/- mice in two models of ALD. Furthermore, bone marrow chimera experiments will be performed to elucidate the contribution of hepatic M?s to the increased susceptibility of gp91phox-/- mice to ALD. (Aim 2), Investigate the impact of gp91phox-deletion on efferocytosis-induced programming of hepatic M?s. Various subpopulations of M?s will be isolated from the livers of ethanol-fed WT and gp91phox-/- mice. The gene profiles of each population will be compared between the two strains of mice. Moreover, the efferocytosis ability and the impact of efferocytosis on the cell phenotype will be compared in each hepatic M? population from WT and gp91phox-/- mice."
"9431040","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic liver disease in Veterans and its prevalence continues to increase, with the growing obesity epidemic. Hepatic steatosis is a component of NAFLD, wherein there is accumulation of triglycerides in the liver. Recently we published that GDNF transgenic mice fed a high fat diet are protected from obesity and the development of hepatic steatosis despite similar food intake and physical activity. GDNF transgenic mice over express GDNF in glia under the GFAP promoter (GDNF-tg) GDNF (expressed in glia) and its receptors, cRET and GFR-1? are expressed in human and murine hepatocytes. Thus, GDNF present in the liver can act locally on the hepatocytes. GDNF-tg mice demonstrate enhanced energy utilization assessed by indirect calorimetry. Having established a role for GDNF in preventing hepatic steatosis we recently examined the role of GDNF in preventing liver injury. Our preliminary data demonstrate novel effects of GDNF on the liver that include: (i) GDNF prevents HFD-induced liver injury (ii) GDNF-tg mice fed a HFD have increased hepatic levels of autophagy; and (iii) Hepatocytes treated with GDNF have improved mitochondrial function as seen by increased basal and mitochondrial respiration The mechanisms for these potentially beneficial effects of GDNF have yet to be explored. We hypothesize that the mechanism of GDNF prevention of hepatic injury is through promoting hepatocyte autophagy and by improving mitochondrial function leading to increased hepatocyte survival. GDNF can increase lipid droplet turnover, fat oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation in hepatic cells through the autophagic pathway. In this proposal we will establish the mechanism of GDNF regulation of hepatocyte autophagy and improved mitochondrial function. Currently there are no FDA approved drugs for the treatment of hepatic steatosis. We have identified a novel neurotrophic factor GDNF that decreases both hepatic steatosis and injury through enhancing autophagy and mitochondrial function. Using both genetic and pharmacological approaches we will define the role of GDNF in inducing autophagy to lead to oxidative lipid metabolism, fat reduction and reduced hepatic injury. We propose the following interrelated, but independently achievable aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine if the mechanism by which GDNF decreases hepatocyte lipid accumulation is through enhanced autophagy mediated lipolysis mediated by suppression of mTOR signaling. Preliminary data indicate that GDNF is a potent inducer of autophagy. We will establish whether autophagy mediates the GDNF-induced reduction in cellular lipid stores by studies of overexpression and knockdown of autophagy related genes. Preliminary data indicate that GDNF suppresses pmTOR signaling which is the prime inhibitory pathway of autophagy. We will determine the mechanism of GDNF up regulation of autophagy focusing on the mTOR pathway. WT and GDNF-tg mice will be fed a high fat diet for 8 weeks and genes regulating autophagy in hepatocytes will be assessed. In vitro the mechanism GDNF regulation of palmitate- induced autophagy will be determined focusing on the mTOR/TFEB/PGC1-? pathway. Specific Aim 2: To establish that GDNF promotes hepatocyte survival by enhancing mitochondrial respiration by the mechanism of enhanced beta-adrenergic signaling and mitophagy. Our preliminary data demonstrate that GDNF increases mitochondrial function in hepatocytes as seen by increasing basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration as well as improving the mitochondrial respiration in hepatocytes cultured in the presence of palmitate. GDNF also promotes lipolysis through activation of ?-adrenergic signaling. We will establish the role of GDNF in regulating mitochondrial respiration using the GDNF-tg mice. We will examine the mechanism of GDNF regulation of mitochondrial health focusing on mitophagy and its effects on improving mitochondrial respiration. Taken together our data from this proposal may provide novel targets for the treatment or prevention of hepatic steatosis and injury."
"9468279","Abstract Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a very common and frequently disabling condition that affects up to 50% of the adult population worldwide, having a huge impact on quality of life and economic burden, loses related to medical expenses, lower labor productivity and increased compensation claims. Unfortunately, our lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying this condition has precluded the development of rationale, safe and effective therapies. While some people display resilience to chronic musculoskeletal pain, research has only focused on the psychological aspects involved in such resilience. However, growing evidence suggests that, in addition to psychological factors, a physical component is critical to achieve resilience to chronic pain and that failure to display adequate reparative and/or regenerative responses is associated with persistent pain. The phenomenon of repeated bout effect (RBE) is a common and natural example of the involvement of an endogenous reparative response (i.e., physical resilience) to muscle injury and persistent pain. Initial exposure to strenuous muscle activity produces significant pain, loss of force and tissue damage, which over time resolves without any external intervention. Re-exposure to the same activity, will however, produce much less pain, dysfunction and tissue damage, suggesting that physical resilience is enhanced by the muscle activity. Although recent research has underlined the importance of immune, endocrine and neural responses in muscle repair and regeneration, whether they also contribute to recovery from persistent musculoskeletal pain is unknown. Furthermore, whether exposure to stress or repetitive ergonomic tasks interferes with physical resilience, leading to chronic musculoskeletal pain, remains unknown. We plan to combine our expertise in several experimental approaches and our new preclinical model of RBE to study physical resilience, to achieve the three major goals of this proposal: (1) elucidate the role of muscle activity in physical resilience, with emphasis on mechanisms of ergonomic injury-induced chronic muscle pain; (2) evaluate the interaction between stress and physical resilience on chronic musculoskeletal pain, especially in regard to the role of early-life interventions on physical resilience and muscle nociceptor hyperexcitability; and, (3) assess the effect of physical resilience on neuropathic muscle pain, with emphasis on cellular and molecular mechanisms of muscle nociceptor dysfunction. !"

"9462786","Project 3: Psychosis Abstract: A more severe phenotype of Alzheimer disease (AD) is identified by the occurrence of psychosis. AD with psychosis (AD+P) is common, with a cumulative incidence of ~ 40%-60% in subjects with AD. AD+P subjects have more rapid cognitive decline, increased disability, and greater mortality than AD subjects without psychosis (AD-P). Current empiric treatments for psychosis in AD have limited efficacy and are associated with substantial toxicity, motivating efforts to identify the underlying neurobiology of AD+P. We have assembled a large brain tissue collection of AD cases characterized antemortem for psychosis, placing us in a unique position to address this need. This project will test our overarching model that AD+P results from specific biologic processes that modify AD-related neurodegeneration, yielding more rapid cognitive decline and psychotic symptoms. This model initially derived from our observation that the occurrence of psychosis in AD is familial, a finding which has since been replicated in two independent cohorts. Brain imaging and neuropathologic studies provide further evidence of a characteristic neurobiology of AD+P, with exaggerated reductions of gray matter volume, blood flow, glucose metabolism, and increased phosphotau (pTau) burden in multiple neocortical regions. Additional AD+P risk may also result from comorbid neocortical stage Lewy body pathology. Nevertheless, in our preliminary data, after accounting for all of these pathologies, unexplained causation of psychosis in AD remains. The more rapid cognitive decline in AD+P, and observations that synapse loss is the strongest correlate of cognitive impairment, suggest that synaptic dysfunction and loss is one source of the missing neuropathology in AD+P. Additionally, recent genetic studies have highlighted inflammation as having a more central role in AD neurodegeneration than previously appreciated, and inflammation, especially when affecting synaptic proteins, is strongly associated with psychosis. We therefore propose a set of specific aims designed to determine the proportion of AD+P explained by these pathologies: 1) To quantify the burden of AD and comorbid neuropathologies within neocortical regions in AD+P and AD-P subjects; 2) To evaluate markers of synaptic dysfunction and loss in AD+P; 3) To evaluate markers of inflammation in AD+P. Combining a Sr. Investigator (Sweet) with expertise in the synaptic pathology of psychosis and a Jr. Investigator (Kofler) with expertise in the neuropathology and immunology of AD provides strong scientific synergy, increased likelihood of success, and an opportunity for career development. Completion of these aims will provide the necessary basis for future mechanistic studies assessing whether interventions to alter affected pathways (pTau, synaptic signaling & inflammatory) may slow synaptic impairment and cognitive decline downstream of A? in model systems. In addition, our findings will inform how much each pathologic process contributes to AD+P risk, and allow evaluation of whether that weighting differs across individuals, which could be important for future efforts at personalized therapeutics."
"9480806","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) Program coordinates and promotes all of the cancer prevention and control-related research activities within Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. Through program planning and evaluation, CPC leads innovative research that aims to generate the knowledge needed to reduce the cancer burden in Georgia and beyond. Research within the program is organized around four scientific themes: (1) Cancer Epidemiology, which aims to identify risk factors, including individual biological and behavioral factors, community and policy factors, and environmental exposures in an effort to inform targeted interventions and strategies to reduce cancer risk in Georgia; (2) Interventions, which focuses on chemoprevention trials, individual behavioral interventions, and policy and systems-level changes with the ultimate goal of broad-scale implementation of effective strategies; (3) Cancer Survivorship, which focuses on treatment-related early effects, including patient-reported outcomes, biobehavioral changes in the brain, and late effects such as cardiovascular diseases, all of which substantially affect the quality-of-life of cancer survivors; and (4) Quality of Cancer Care, which aims to conduct population-based research that describes, interprets, and predicts the impact of health care interventions and other factors on quality of cancer care and outcomes. Under the leadership of Timothy Lash, DSc, MPH (leader) and Andrew Miller, MD (co-leader), the CPC Program includes 45 core members representing 15 different departments within the School of Medicine, Rollins School of Public Health, and Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing at Emory University. Between 2012 and present this highly collaborative group of researchers published 803 cancer-relevant scientific articles. Of these, 175 (22%) were intra- and 122 (15%) were inter-programmatic collaborations; 365 (45%) represented a collaboration with another cancer center or other academic organization. As of March 31, 2016, CPC held $11.7 million in annual total cancer-relevant research funding, of which approximately $5.8M (50%) was awarded directly from the NCI. The CPC Program has substantially and directly influenced efforts to reduce the cancer burden in Georgia and beyond, and through strategic planning has a vision for building on this foundation to expanded impact in the next project period."
"9442682","SUMMARY Diabetic bone disease, with its elevated risk for fragility fracture, is increasingly recognized as a distinct entity that cannot be assessed sufficiently with standard methods used for osteoporosis. Severe deficits in cortical bone structure, specifically increased cortical porosity, are associated with fracture prevalence in T2D. Cortical porosity has deleterious effects on bone strength, and is critical in fracture initiation and propagation. Despite the biomechanical importance of cortical porosity, the origins and temporal evolution of pathological cortical porosity in T2D are unknown. To develop treatments specifically targeted to the prevention or reversal of pathological cortical porosity and associated bone fragility in T2D, we must understand the mechanisms driving development of these large cortical pores. Today, these mechanisms are unknown though many have been posited, including endocortical `trabecularization' and expansion of the Haversian network. We hypothesize that determining the content and spatial distribution of cortical pore space will reveal biological systems influencing pore expansion. Marrow within pores near the endosteal border may indicate endocortical `trabecularization', or infiltration of the marrow cavity into the cortical envelope. Alternatively, vessels within pores distributed throughout the cortex may indicate pore formation via expansion of the vascular network. The identification of biological systems associated with pore expansion will elucidate appropriate cellular targets for drug development. The overall goal of this proposed study is to understand the longitudinal evolution of human diabetic bone disease and to investigate the underlying biological processes that drive increased cortical porosity in the setting of T2D. We propose the first longitudinal study of pore progression in T2D patients, which will be performed using a novel combined high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and contrast enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging approach, with the following aims: I: Determine if increased porosity in T2D is associated with altered marrow distribution and composition, II: Determine if increased porosity in T2D is associated with altered vessel distribution and vascular health, and III: Determine if T2D status or marrow or vessel metrics predict longitudinal increase in porosity and decrease in strength. To address aims I and II, we will perform multimodal imaging in a cross-sectional cohort of T2D patients and matched control subjects. To address aim III, we will follow these subjects in a 2-year longitudinal study. This work will establish whether cortical pore content can serve as a predictor of future cortical degradation, and begin to elucidate biological drivers and possible drug targets for the prevention or reversal of T2D-associated pathological porosity and bone fragility, laying the groundwork for future therapeutic studies. With the number of devastating diabetic fragility fractures increasing, these studies have the potential for immense clinical impact."
"9440274","The genetics of life threatening diseases offer the possibility of fundamental insights into pathophysiology that can transform diagnosis and management. Genome wide genetic association studies (GWASs) of the past decade have identified DNA sequence genotypic relationships to disease phenotypes, usually without any accompanying insight into the incredibly complex biology that operates between genotype and disease risk.  Our DVA Merit Award work has focused on the genetics of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). There are now >50 established and published genetic associations and our recent results will raise this to >100 SLE risk loci. Associations without mechanisms are of very limited practical utility. Our present focus has become elucidating these mechanisms and we have made much progress at the IRF5 and ETS1 lupus risk loci. Using frequentist and Bayesian statistics along with the differences and similarities of the associated variants in the major human ancestries we generate Ancestry Informed Credible Sets (AICSs) of plausibly causal variants. The subsequent search for allele specific functional consequences for these variants is enormously aided by all of the work now underway characterizing the protein and RNA species that interact with chromatin. Using the dataset infrastructure now available and methods that identify DNA ligands, we have identified ZBTB3 and STAT1 as relatively specific AICS risk allele transcription factors for IRF5 and ETS1, respectively. We propose to focus on the important association in the STAT4 gene with SLE where STAT1, this time through its expression, again appears to be important. We have reduced the plausibly causal variants from 56 to only 4 variants in the 2nd and 4th introns of STAT4. We have results suggesting the astonishing possibility that HMGA1 binds with varying allele specificity to 3 of the 4 variants in the AICS for the STAT4 locus. HMGA1 acts as a chromatin scaffold influencing DNA looping and chromatin conformation.  We (and others) have shown that STAT4 expression is altered by the risk haplotype. We have recent data showing that STAT1 expression is also associated with STAT4 alleles. In addition, we show association of the DNA binding sites of STAT1 with the 53 published SLE risk loci (p?10-10). With the strong association at STAT4 with SLE across all human ancestries (1.2<odds ratio (OR)<1.8), the STAT4 allele dependent expression of STAT4 and STAT1, the demonstration of allele specific binding of STAT1 at ETS1, the relationship of STAT1 to SLE risk loci, and the association of STAT4 with other inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjgren's syndrome (SS), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), and type 1 diabetes (T1D)), we conclude that the STAT1-STAT4 locus has earned our concentrated effort.  We will experimentally evaluate the relationship between the AICS variants (Aim 1) and STAT4 and STAT1 expression in the context of HMGA1 binding to the AICS, especially using luciferase expression vectors and with chromatin editing of the AICS variants. In addition, we will use chromatin editing strategies (CRISPR technologies) to establish the influence of allelic differences at the 4 plausibly causal variants on the expression of STAT1 and STAT4. We will identify the allele specific binding of STAT1 and STAT4 at SLE loci (Aim 2) using a standard protocol for chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). Experiments will be performed in transformed B cell lines and in isolated B cells, both from patients and controls. These experiments will set the stage for future experiments in other cell types (various T cells, monocytes, dendritic cells) and for the exploration of mechanism in the other STAT1-STAT4 associated diseases: RA, SS, PBC, PSS, and T1D, emphasizing how important understanding the mechanism(s) will be for understanding human autoimmunity. This project will help illuminate the inside of a black box now existent between DNA variants in STAT4 and SLE disease expression and in the process provide insights, data, and new tools that have the potential to influence management and the development of therapeutics."
"9462791","Core D: Neuropathology Core Project Summary/Abstract The UCI ADRC Neuropathology (NP) Core links clinical evaluations with definitive neuropathological diagnoses. Neuropathology remains the definitive method for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The UCI ADRC cohorts consist of a longitudinal cohort, and two unique patient populations: adults with Down syndrome and individuals over 90 years of age ( 90+ ), representing cohorts at high risk of developing dementia. Down syndrome represents the single most prevalent cause of early-onset AD, whereas the 90+ cohort represents subjects with a high rate of conversion to dementia. Both cohorts provide unique opportunities to study the transition of `cognitively normal' to dementia. The overarching goal of the NP Core is to provide the infrastructure to support research on all three ADRC cohorts that aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that define normal aging, the transition to MCI, and the subsequent transition from MCI to AD/dementia. As part of its mission, the UCI NP Core disseminates well-characterized tissues, biospecimens and reagents to basic scientists at UCI and abroad to stimulate and facilitate research in AD and other age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Using standardized methods for processing, the NP Core supports multi-center collaborative studies. Additionally, the NP Core seeks to innovate by establishing infrastructure to support novel technologies, techniques, and data collection to increase the value of the stored tissue and biospecimens. Lastly, the NP Core reports important AD research findings in collaboration with the Education Core. In order to achieve the goals of the NP Core, we propose seven specific aims: (1) Perform an accurate and timely autopsy of the ADRC cohorts (Longitudinal, Down syndrome, and 90+) and provide a standardized neuropathological report to the Data Management and Statistics Core for deposition with NACC, and to the Clinical Core for dissemination to the families of the deceased participants and their physicians; (2) Store, catalog, and disseminate brain tissue and biospecimens from ADRC subjects; (3) Store, catalog, and disseminate novel reagents made by UCI investigators; (4) Support and consult on ADRC projects, ADRC pilot studies, and studies on AD mechanisms by investigators funded by other means, including ADC collaborative projects; (5) Develop and establish new core functions to facilitate innovative research to study the transition of MCI to AD; (6) Participate in the public education of Chinese-Americans and others; (7) Train pathologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroscientists, neuropsychologists, and students on the neuropathological features of AD and other dementing disorders."
"9462049","PROJECT SUMMARY More than 10% of the 15 million Americans who experience skeletal fractures each year suffer from impaired healing. The large incidence of impaired healing results in poor quality of life and high total cost of care for pa- tients. To enhance fracture healing, various regenerative medicine based approaches are being developed, but their development rates are slow due to the limitations of current imaging techniques. For example, vasculariza- tion, a key step in bone healing, is assessed using endpoint methods requiring sacri?ce/destruction of animals, leading to high inter-subject variability, time and cost. Our objective is to establish diffuse optical tomography (DOT) and correlation tomography (DCT) as non-invasive, longitudinal research tools to monitor vascularization and predict bone fracture healing. DOT and DCT, 3D deep-tissue hemodynamic imaging techniques, are ideal for frequent longitudinal monitoring due to low cost and the use of non-ionizing light. In addition, DOT and DCT are easily scalable between preclinical and clinical applications. Together, these methods report multiple microvas- cular parameters: total hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation with DOT and blood ?ow with DCT. We hypothesize that DOT and DCT provide accurate quanti?cation of regional blood volume, oxygenation and ?ow in bone and surrounding soft tissues, which can serve as surrogate markers for the quality of bone healing. Three speci?c aims are designed to test the hypotheses: Aim 1: Construct a prediction model for bone fracture treatment ef?cacy using an animal bone fracture model, Aim 2: Directly compare DOT and DCT with histomorphometry, ?uorescent microsphere technique and dynamic-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in a murine fracture model, Aim 3: Construct clinical prediction model for nonunions in proximal ?fth metatarsal fractures based on DOT and DCT measurements. Successful completion of these aims will result in great advances in regenerative medicine and musculoskeletal research by providing a comprehensive and innovative non-invasive longitudinal monitoring tool. In addition, the proposed work lays the foundation for clinical translation of DOT and DCT for bone vascular monitoring by direct comparison with traditional vascularization assessment techniques and by constructing a clinical prediction model for impaired healing in fractures."
"9447195","Project Summary Disordered lipid metabolism (dyslipidemia) is a critical risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although dyslipidemia can be reduced by dietary interventions, the changes in lipid profile that occur in response to diet are highly variable. Prior studies have identified genetic factors that contribute to interindividual variation, but due to insufficient genomic coverage, lack of integration with epigenetic data, and reliance on traditional lipid measures, they were unable to capture the full range of heritable influences or to distinguish between lipoproteins with differential impact on disease risk. This project will capitalize on the whole-genome sequencing data generated by the NHLBI TOPMed program to identify and characterize novel genetic predictors of lipoprotein response to a high-fat meal. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)- based measurements of lipoprotein subfractions taken at baseline and after a high-fat meal, this project aims to: 1) identify and validate novel predictors of postprandial lipoprotein response via whole-genome sequencing analysis of ~1800 participants of the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) and the Heredity and Phenotype (HAPI) Heart cohorts; 2) test for associations between postprandial changes in lipoprotein subfractions and those in small molecule lipids, as well as identify shared genetic determinants of these phenotypes; and 3) conduct follow-up analysis of top genetic regions implicated in lipoprotein subfraction response by bisulfite sequencing and tests for association between DNA sequence variation, DNA methylation, and gene expression. The proposed project leverages the rich multilayered ? omics data available in GOLDN and HAPI Heart and emerging methods of integrated analysis, providing Dr. Aslibekyan's with crucial tools and experience to become an independent `big data' cardiovascular scientist and a successful TOPMed investigator."
"9442776","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT I. Candidate I am a board-certified orthodontist and a research-track faculty at the UCLA School of Dentistry. I am a dual- trained clinician scientist, with significant background in bone tissue engineering with 16 publications, 24 podium abstract presentations, and 6 national-level excellence-in-research awards to date. For the past 7 years I have worked extensively with various transdisciplinary research teams at UCLA, based on which I have sought primary mentorship from Dr. Chia Soo and formed the five-person advisory committee of the current proposal. Under Dr. Soo's new mentorship, I am in the path of establishing a clear independence from my previous and current mentors' work, evidenced by my recent achievements delineated in the current proposal. My immediate career goals are to secure time and effort for research career development by means of a K08 award, continue devising innovations relevant to the Nation's research needs, and build upon my prolific publication record. My end goal is for scientific independence in a tenure faculty position, and to continue addressing the Nation's biomedical and clinical research needs by transdisciplinary efforts. A K08 award will tremendously benefit my career development by providing (i) a structured program to cultivate multidisciplinary research skills, (ii) salary support to maintain commitment to research-track, and (iii) protected research time. The astonishing five-member advisory committee assembled for this proposal consists of developmental and molecular biologists, clinician scientists with FDA experience, and bioengineer to provide mentorship in this highly translational and multidisciplinary project. The distinguished and experienced mentors are composed of leading members of the UCLA research community, and will provide both research and administrative support. In addition to receiving unanimous institutional backing from the School of Dentistry, I will benefit from and strengthen the robust collaboration that exists between my mentors and their research collaborators. II. Environment UCLA is one of the leading public research institutions in the world and provides an excellent academic environment with rich intellectual resources, abundant research facilities, and robust institutional support. The institutional environment at UCLA offers a great wealth of closely integrated and shared physical and human resources that can foster the growth and intellectual development of a young scientific investigator. III. Research Dental osteopenia and its associated morbidities such as tooth loss, periodontal implant failures, and malfitting dentures are projected to cost over $240 billion worldwide by 2040. Therapeutic approaches to osteoporotic bone loss have focused on either anabolic or antiresorptive agents. However, there is a pressing need to develop new agents that target both bone formation and resorption. Importantly, there is no concrete evidence that supports whether an osteoporosis therapy can also prevent the dentoalveolar osteopenia frequently seen in post-menopausal osteoporotic patients. NELL-1 is a potent pro-osteogenic and anti-resorptive protein that was recently found to exert a systemic, protective function against osteoporotic bone loss. PEGylation of NELL-1 (NELL-PEG) has enhanced NELL-1's pharmacokinetics as a systemic therapy. As a result, preliminary studies demonstrate that systemic NELL-PEG regenerates ovariectomy-induced bone loss not only in long bones, but also in maxillary alveolar bone in mice. This has led to our central hypothesis that systemic NELL-PEG therapy can reverse osteoporotic bone loss in both postcranial (appendicular and axial) and craniofacial (cranium, maxilla, and mandible) skeleton. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims:  AIM 1. Determine the pharmacokinetics and the targeting efficiency of NELL-1 and PEGylated NELL-1. In this aim, we will determine the pharmacokinetic profile of systemic NELL-PEG in bone and plasma over an 8-week period. Both postcranial and craniofacial bones will be analyzed.  AIM 2. Determine the therapeutic efficacy of PEGylated NELL-1 in regenerating jaw bones alongside postcranial bones in osteoporotic mice. AIM 2A will evaluate the effect of systemic NELL-PEG on craniofacial versus postcranial bones in OVX-induced osteoporotic mice. Previously determined formulations of systemic NELL-PEG will be tested, and bone density, formation, and turnover will be assessed. Concurrently, AIM 2B will evaluate systemic NELL-PEG effects on the number and activity of stem cells, osteoblasts (OB), and osteoclasts (OC) in the mandible, long bone and vertebra.  AIM 3. Examine the effects of Nell-1 on craniofacial versus postcranial skeletal development and maintenance in osteoblast-specific transgenic knockout mice. In this aim, we will cross our recently generated Nell-1flox/flox mice with 2.3kb Col1-Cre and Wnt1-Cre to examine osteoblast and neural crest specific effects, respectively.  Novel rNELL-1 based therapies can vastly improve the standard of care for the treatment of osteoporosis, dental osteopenia and its morbidities. Development of a systemic therapy that can promote dual anabolic and anti-osteoclastic effects in craniofacial and postcranial bones alike would provide a groundbreaking therapy."
"9481671","This proposal focuses on development of new potential treatments for patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Among symptomatic patients with HF, approximately half have preserved ejection fraction, and their mortality is similar to those with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF). However, unlike the case with HFrEF, there is currently no treatment for HFpEF that prolongs life, and few that reduce hospitalization rates for heart failure. We need new therapies to address this unmet medical need. Discovering and developing such an approach is the purpose of this proposal. Cardiovascular gene transfer is conceptually an attractive method for treating heart failure, but difficulty in obtaining high yield transgene expression in the heart in a manner that can be easily and safely applied has been challenging. However, we recently have demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous (IV) delivery of a long-term expression vector encoding a peptide, urocortin-2 (UCn2), with favorable cardiovascular effects through its paracrine action. A single intravenous injection in normal mice of an adeno-associated virus vector (AAV8) encoding murine UCn2 (AAV8.UCn2) has favorable effects on Tau and LV peak -dP/dt, two measures of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. This approach solves the problem of attaining high yield cardiac gene transfer and ultimately would enable patients to be treated by intravenous injection during an office visit, and provides a novel means to increase diastolic function. The goal of this proposal is to test the safety and efficacy of this method of therapy in animal models of HFpEF. In the 4-year tenure of our present VA Merit, we have published three papers on the effectiveness of gene transfer of UCn2: one in normal mice, a second in mice with HFrEF, and a third that focuses on the safety and metabolic effects of UCn2 gene transfer. Gene transfer of AAV8 encoding UCn2 yielded persistent increases in plasma UCn2 (18 months following a single IV injection) and improved LV function in severe HF induced by myocardial infarction. In these studies, we noted that UCn2 gene transfer increased LV peak -dP/dt (p<0.0001) and reduced Tau (p=0.05). We now propose to test the safety and efficacy of IV delivery of AAV8.UCn2 in two models of HFpEF: 1) trans-aortic constriction (TAC), which imposes a LV pressure stress and HFpEF in the early phase; and 2) aged mice (18-months-old) many of which have diastolic dysfunction and meet criteria for HFpEF. Although our primary goal is to improve LV diastolic function and to test this in physiological studies after gene transfer, we also will determine mechanisms for the anticipated increase in diastolic function. In the final year, we will initiate testing in rabbits as a segue to an eventual Investigational New Drug (IND) application to initiate a clinical trial using AAV8.UCn2 to treat patients with HFpEF, a transition we have made in our laboratory twice previously (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00787059 and NCT00346437)."
"9462781","Core E: ORE Core Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health problem and its increasing prevalence demands a concomitant increase in AD-related outreach, research recruitment, and education. In response to our local needs assessment and calls for action at the state (PA State Alzheimer's Plan) and federal (National Alzheimer's Project Act) levels, we have identified the following specific aims for the proposed period of support: Aim 1) To sustain effective and initiate new outreach activities that are responsive to local stakeholder needs and address regional and national priorities in Alzheimer's disease research and care; Aim 2) To facilitate recruitment of diverse participants at the earliest end of the AD spectrum into the Clinical Core, Projects 1 and 2, and ancillary studies; Aim 3) To train health professionals and students of the health sciences in the diagnosis of persons at the earliest end of the AD spectrum and those experiencing related disorders; and Aim 4) To administer the Center's research mentoring program for junior investigators in the field of AD and cognitive aging. We will achieve interrelated these aims through a research strategy that includes innovative programming and builds on our biggest successes over the past several years. Key examples of planned programming include: tailored community outreach and recruitment efforts targeting the demographic group of older African Americans and the key clinical group of persons transitioning from normalcy to dementia (Aims 1 and 2); developing and delivering on-site health professional training that maximizes trainees' access to PITT-ADRC faculty, as well as more general clinical training to larger audiences in partnership with UPMC, the Alzheimer's Association and the University's HRSA-funded Geriatric Education Center (Aim 3); and providing a platform for research mentoring by expanding the PITT-ADRC peer mentoring group for junior investigators to form the PITT-ADRC MIND Scholars Program, which will serve as a central mechanism for providing career development mentoring to trainees working with faculty across all Cores of the ADRC (Aim 4). These and other elements of our research strategy will be evaluated on an ongoing basis using such methods as tracking the number and characteristics of participants in our programs (community, student, and professional), administering feedback forms to each group of learners, monitoring the research productivity of research trainees, and monitoring the number of individuals who sign up to receive information or be contacted by the PITT-ADRC either following community presentations, or as a result of specific partnerships with community groups, providers, and other research collaborators."
"9567498","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Motor impairment following ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of disability and reduced quality of life for our veterans and the general population. Physical therapy (PT) has been the mainstay of rehabilitation to restore motor function, but there is a clear need to improve and expand rehabilitation strategies. The use of adjunct medication has been extensively studied as one approach to enhance clinical outcomes. However, no drugs are presently established to be effective in enhancing rehabilitation-aided motor recovery. Studies from our lab and others suggest that certain drugs, such as amphetamine, hold such promise. Unfortunately, negative cardiovascular side effects associated with amphetamine have hindered its clinical application in stroke rehabilitation. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the rehabilitative potential of drugs will aid in the development of more effective, safer therapies. To this end the ability of amphetamine to enhance basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) signaling in the brain may be one such mechanism. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that upregulation of FGF2 in the brain can significantly enhance motor recovery following ischemic stroke by facilitating neurite outgrowth from spared motor pathways through fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1)-related mechanisms. In aim I we will demonstrate that direct upregulation of FGF2 through intranasal application of plasmid DNA encoding FGF2 enhances motor recovery following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. The importance of pairing treatment with physical therapy and the effects of delaying treatment on motor performance will also be assessed. Anterograde and retrograde tract tracing techniques will be used to ascertain the extent to which the unlesioned motor cortex sends new neuronal projections to once-denervated motor regions (i.e. the red nucleus). Biochemical studies will assess changes in transgene and native FGF2 expression and FGFR-related signaling implicated in neurite outgrowth. In Aim II we will extend our previously published work and determine the role of FGFR1 in mediating amphetamine-enhanced motor recovery and neural plasticity (i.e. neurite outgrowth) following permanent MCAO in rats. Two complementary approaches will be employed. A pharmacological approach will use the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ponatinib, to globally inhibit FGFR signaling in the brain. A genetic approach will use a recombinant adeno-associated viral construct encoding for shRNA to FGFR1 to more specifically knock down FGFR1 in the unlesioned motor cortex, which we have previously established to be the site of new neuronal efferents. Aim III will follow the same intervention design as Aim II except the importance of FGFR signaling in mediating enhanced motor improvement and neurite outgrowth induced by plasmid-mediated upregulation of FGF2, as established in Aim I, will be tested. Taken together, the findings of this proposal will provide the framework for future mechanistic and translational studies to optimize rehabilitation paradigms for improved functional recovery following stroke."

"9679640","Project Summary/Abstract Vector-borne diseases (VBD) pose a significant economic and public health threat throughout developing tropical regions worldwide, including the Caribbean. The introduction in December 2013 and rapid spread of the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) throughout all the Caribbean nations, and more recently the emergence of the zika virus in Suriname and Martinique highlights the need to develop regional capacity to investigate, predict, contain, and respond to VBD. For example, recent evidence from la Runion suggests that CHIKV can negatively impact neurodevelopment among infants born to mothers who were infected with the virus during pregnancy. However, these results have not yet been replicated in other sites internationally ? such as the Caribbean ? nor have any longitudinal studies been carried out to follow children who have experienced neurocognitive delay related to CHIKV infection. To address the paucity of data while building VBD research capacity in tropical LMICs where these diseases are endemic and the burden of impaired neurodevelopment is felt most, researchers from St. George's University (SGU) in Grenada will partner with researchers from Stanford University, Oxford University, and the Universit de La Runion to: (1) Determine the prevalence of mother to child transmission of CHIKV in Grenadian pregnant mothers; (2) Measure the neurodevelopment of children at 2 years of age exposed at different trimesters in utero to CHIKV and compare them with unexposed children; (3) Assess the burden of confounding factors to better understand the specific impact of VBD on neurodevelopment and inform public health priorities; (4) Build local capacity for arboviral and neurodevelopmental testing at SGU. To achieve Aim 1, 379 moms and their infants who were born during the CHIKV outbreak in Grenada, 473 moms and their infants who were born after the outbreak and may have been exposed to the virus in utero, and 190 moms and their infants who were born at least nine months after the outbreak (and thus, very unlikely to be exposed to the virus in utero) will complete a survey detailing the onset and symptoms related to their CHIKV infection and will then be tested for exposure to CHIKV by ELISA. Non CHIKV-exposed infants and moms, CHIKV-exposed moms but not infants, CHIKV-exposed moms and infants, and time of exposure during pregnancy will be used to divide groups for neurocognitive comparison at 2-years of age. To achieve Aims 2 and 3, we will administer the intergrowth 21st Neurodevelopment Assessment ? a holistic assessment of early child development developed at Oxford University ? while controlling for confounding neurodevelopmental factors. To achieve Aim 4, we will establish a Regional Center for Child Neurodevelopment while addressing seven key areas of needed research support: (1) Financial (i.e., granting); (2) Expertise; (3) On-the-ground human resources; (4) Student trainees to build local capacity; (5) Equipment, IT, and facilities support; (6) On-the-ground university and research institute administrative support; and (7) Local and regional government, relevant NGO, and professional/academic institutional support.

The development of targeted therapies is a promising avenue for the effective treatment of PTSD, but to develop these treatments, first we must better understand the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. The goal of the proposed project is to determine whether combat Veterans with PTSD have alterations in an anxiety neural circuit mediated by the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). In rodents, the BNST mediates anxiety, hypervigilance, and behavioral effects of stress-similar to symptoms of PTSD. In combat Veterans with PTSD, these symptoms are increased in situations where a threat is unpredictable; that is, a threatening event may or may not occur. We propose to compare OEF/OIF/OND combat-exposed Veterans with and without PTSD. We have developed novel methods to examine BNST activation to unpredictable threats using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study will focus on three specific aims: (1) determine whether combat Veterans with PTSD have heightened BNST activation compared to combat Veterans without PTSD; (2) identify alterations in BNST connectivity with other regions of the anxiety circuit in Veterans with PTSD; (3) determine whether stress response (measured by cortisol and skin conductance) mediates the association between BNST function (activation and connectivity) and PTSD symptoms. Ultimately we aim to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PTSD to identify novel brain targets for treatment."
"9551510","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic debilitating disease affecting over 1% of Americans. Women are affected about 3 times more often than men. RA also constitutes a major health problem among the U.S. Veterans. The Veteran population is aging, and the number of women serving in the military is gradually increasing. In addition, Veterans in combat zones are exposed to extreme stress and toxic substances in different forms. All these factors may directly or indirectly influence host immunity and induction/aggravation of RA. The pain, discomfort, lost working days, and disabilities caused by RA can adversely affect Veterans' quality of life and work in many ways, as well as impose heavy cost of healthcare and rehabilitation. Therefore, studies advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of RA are highly relevant to the U.S. Veterans. Two main challenges in the field of arthritis are 1) to define the mechanisms that render the joints highly prone to attack by a systemic autoimmune response, and 2) to devise novel ways to direct systemically-administered drugs primarily into the inflamed joints (without intra-articular injection) to achieve maximum therapeutic effect, but with minimum adverse effects. We hypothesize that the vascular endothelium of the inflamed joints is characterized by unique molecular markers that facilitate both selective migration of pathogenic T cells into the target organ (the arthritic joints) and cellular/ molecular interactions with the mediators of inflammation and bone damage. Furthermore, the targeting of one or more of these vascular endothelial cell markers would offer new therapeutic approaches for downregulating joint inflammation and tissue damage without undue adverse reactions or systemic toxicity. This proposition is based on the results of our recently published study in PNAS on the synovial vasculature in the rat adjuvant arthritis (AA) model of RA, which was done in collaboration with Dr. Erkki Ruoslahti (Sanford-Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). The study was aimed at identifying unique arthritic joint-homing peptides using an innovative approach of in vitro and in vivo enrichment of clones from a phage peptide-display library. The advantage of the phage system for the detection of tissue-specific markers is that there is no a priori bias in predicting the ligands that bind to the vascular endothelium. And, unlike antibodies the phage-displayed peptides interact with the functional domain of the target molecule. This approach has been pioneered by Dr. Ruoslahti, who has developed the concept of vascular address molecules or zip codes. His group has examined several organs in this regard, but not the joints. We have now filled this gap by identifying two novel 9-residue peptides (denoted as NQR and ADK) that preferentially home to the inflamed joints and show unique receptor-binding and cellular-signaling attributes compared to the well-known arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif that binds to specific integrins. Furthermore, the treatment of arthritic rats wit NQR peptide attenuated AA, whereas ADK peptide failed to do so. The aims of our study are: Aim 1. Use the peptides (NQR and ADK) with a drug for synovial vasculature-targeted delivery into arthritic joints to control inflammation and bone damage. As a proof-of-concept, the drug will be encapsulated in liposomes, whose surface is decorated with NQR/ADK peptide. These joint-homing peptides would direct the liposomes preferentially into the inflamed joints. Liposomes will be treated with polyethylene glycol to inhibit their uptake by the reticuloendothelial system; Aim 2.  Define the cellular/molecular events triggered by the joint-homing peptides upon interaction with endothelial cells and to examine the mechanisms underlying the anti-arthritic activity of NQR peptide. We will determine the effect of NQR/ADK peptide on the pathogenic mediators produced by endothelial cells; the gene expression profile of endothelial cells; and the migration of defined subsets of leukocytes. The results of this study would advance our knowledge of the disease process in autoimmune arthritis and help design novel peptide-directed, targeted drug delivery with increased therapeutic index for the treatment of RA."
"9537462","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), a systemic autoimmune disorder, affects multiple organ systems resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Lupus nephritis is a devastating complication of SLE, with an increased mortality and risk of progressive renal damage leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To date, there remains no definitive pathway to identify the population of patients with lupus nephritis who are ultimately destined to ESRD. Identification of genes predicting ESRD risk in SLE would permit more vigorous treatment in this subgroup despite the potentially significant side effects. In our study of the genetics of lupus- prone mouse model NZM2328, we have identified separate genes controlling ANA and anti-dsDNA Ab production (Adaz1 on chromosome 4), and controlling both acute and chronic glomerulonephritis (GN) (Cgnz1 on chromosome 1 for controlling chronic GN and Agnz1 on chromosome 1, H-2 complex and Agnz2 on chromosome 17 for controlling acute GN). The phenotypes of NZM2328.Lc1 (Lc1) and Lc1 intrachromosomal recombinant congenic lines and NZM2328.Lc4 confirm our genetic analysis. A novel model for pathogenesis of SLE was proposed in which the genes contributing to lupus are classified into two classes - those affecting autoimmune responsiveness and those affecting end organ damage. These two classes of genes interact, resulting in clinical disease. The concept of genes controlling end organ resistance in SLE is novel. Additional data show that acute and chronic GN are under separate genetic control. A 1.34MB region on mouse chromosome 1 (the Cgnz1 locus) has been shown to contain gene(s) that confer resistance to the progression of acute GN (aGN) to chronic GN (cGN). In this competitive renewal application we wish to continue our research program to identify Cgnz1, the gene(s) within the 1.34Mb regions that confers end organ (kidney) susceptibility to damage. Three specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: To generate podocytes and tubular cell lines from NZM2328 and NZM2328.Lc1R27 (R27) to carryout in vitro gene deletion by the CRISPR/Cas method to identify candidate gene(s) that confer(s) resistance to apoptosis or play an important role in autophagy. Both podocytes and tubular cells will be used. These candidate genes will be targeted in Specific Aim 2; Specific Aim 2: To generate mutant lines with deficiency in targeted genes in (NZM2328XR27)F1 embryos by CRISPR/Cas and to generate homozygous mutants to validate susceptibility to end stage renal damage and to generate podocyte specific deletion mutants to demonstrate the gene(s) that exert(s) effects on podocytes; and Specific Aim 3: To identify candidate gene(s) on the human Cgnz1 1.6Mb locus (Hu Cgnz1) that determine the progression of progressive GN in lupus to ESRD. The results of the proposed studies will be validated and refined in future studies involving larger samples. We anticipate that they may provide biomarkers that are of prognostic value and utility for ESRD risk management. Thus the application will generate significant information regarding the pathogenesis of lupus GN and will have significant translational potentials."
"9548156","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Impairments in mitochondrial functions have been frequently implicated in ischemic brain injury associated with cardiac arrest or stroke. However, the extent to which mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons and astrocytes contributes to neurodegeneration is unknown, and the mechanisms leading to mitochondrial failure are elusive. Recently, it was suggested that an imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics could lead to neurodegeneration and brain damage. Furthermore, over-activation of NAD+ degrading poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP1) causes excessive cellular and mitochondrial NAD+ depletion resulting in detrimental effects for cell survival. We hypothesize that the activity of ADP-ribose catabolizing enzyme, NUDIX hydrolase NUDT9, leads to downstream mitochondrial GTP consumption and consequently to inhibition of GTPases that control the organelle's fusion. Since ischemic insult triggers an extensive fission of mitochondria, the ability to refuse these organelles is essential for cell viability. This notio is strongly supported by our data showing irreversible fragmentation of mitochondria in ischemia vulnerable regions, re-fusion of mitochondria in ischemia resistant brain cells, and genotoxic stress induced depletion of mitochondrial NAD+ and GTP pools. Our preliminary data also show that over-expression of mitochondrial NUDT9 isoform is aggravating cell death; the mitochondria are more sensitive to ischemic insult and cell death maturation is accelerated in transgenic animals with increased levels of NUDT9. The primary goal of this study is to determine whether neuronal or astrocytic activity of NUDT9 is a major contributor to cell death mechanisms following ischemia. To address these questions we propose to:  1. Determine the specific role of NUDT9 in mitochondrial nucleotide metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetics functions, dynamics and cell death. The role of NUDT9 in cell death of astrocytes and neurons will be examined by utilizing pure neuronal and astrocytic cell cultures prepared from brain tissue of our new transgenic animals that conditionally express mito-eYFP and NUDT9 either in neurons or in astrocytes. These cell cultures will be exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and the effect of NUDT9 on bioenergetics metabolism, mitochondrial respiratory functions, mitochondrial dynamics and cell death will be determined. In addition, cellular and mitochondrial metabolism, mitochondrial respiratory functions, and mitochondrial fusion and fission will be analyzed. Small interference RNA (siRNA)-induced knockdown of the NUDT9 gene will be used to confirm the NUDT9 effect on impairment of mitochondrial dynamics and cell death mechanisms.  2. To study the specific role of NUDT9 in post-insult impairment of mitochondrial dynamics, we will use our transgenic animals that will be subjected to transient forebrain ischemia and at designated recovery periods the alterations in mitochondrial morphometry specifically in neurons or astrocytes in brain will be examined. Finally, we will assesse the effect of NUDT9 over-expression in neurons or astrocytes on the histological and neurological outcome after ischemic insult. Similarly, we will determine the role of NUDT9 enzyme activity in the mechanism of ischemic brain damage by assessing post-ischemic histological and neurological outcome of animals pre-treated with NUDT9 targeted siRNA.  This work proposes both mechanistic and translational approaches to unravel the mechanisms of impairment in neuronal and astrocytic mitochondrial dynamics and determine its role in acute brain injury. Furthermore, the identification of a novel metabolic link between NAD+ catabolism and inhibition of mitochondrial fusion will offer new protective mechanisms that could significantly impact the clinical application of NUDT9 inhibitors as therapeutic compounds for acute brain injury such as global ischemia, stroke, TBI or chronic neurodegenerative disease."
"9558878","Project Summary We propose to develop a novel volumetric specimen imager (VSI) system for significantly reducing breast lumpectomy?s reoperation rate and improving cosmetic outcomes. Among the annual performance of >200,000 lumpectomies in the US, about 25% of patients need reoperations, when post-surgery pathology examination reveals ?positive margin?, indicating incomplete tumor removal in initial surgery. Currently physicians rely either on 2D intra-operative specimen imaging, which has only ~53% sensitivity for positive margin detection, or on randomly shaving additional cavity tissues at all margins, leading to 50% higher excision volume and worse cosmetic outcome. We propose a robust VSI system that yields fully-3D images of the specimen with isotropic, sub-100m resolution, and workflow-streamlining software applications which can significantly improve margin assessment and enable precisely image-guided shave margin. Uniquely enabled by a proprietary algorithm invented by Clarix founders, the VSI provides superior image quality meeting clinical requirements and significant imaging acceleration for seamless workflow integration. In 4-5 years, we plan to introduce the VSI-based solution as the new standard of care for lumpectomy, which is expected to lower the reoperation rate to <10% while reducing excision volume by 30%, thereby considerably reducing healthcare costs and patient inconvenience while improving cosmetic outcomes. We have successfully achieved all Aims in Phase I study, which include (1) to verify that image-quality requirements can be met by a calibrated VSI prototype, (2) to verify that scan-time requirements can be met by optimizing VSI parameters, and (3) to verify that VSI has 90% sensitivity and specificity for assessing lumpectomy margins. In our Phase II study, we hypothesize that an optimized, manufacture-ready VSI prototype can meet technical, workflow, and regulatory requirements for clinical application, and can result in substantially improved margin-assessment accuracy and breast-tissue conservation. The Specific Aims are: (1) to optimize VSI device for robust image acquisition in OR, (2) to create VSI software for seamless OR workflow integration, and (3) to conduct clinical VSI validation for enhancing margin-assessment accuracy and reducing cavity shave-margin volume. Currently 6,000 hospitals and clinics performing lumpectomy in the US form a $720M installed-base. We will focus our in-house talent on the core software and configuration design. We will partner with experienced specialists for regulatory-compliant engineering design, and with leading research hospitals for clinical study. Our Phase I success has attracted investors such as Softbank for assisting to obtain FDA 510(k) clearance within 2 years. After proving the commercial viability regionally, we will obtain further venture financing to scale nationally and internationally."
"9464353","The population over 65 will increase to ~87 million by 2050. [Age alone is the greatest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of neurodegeneration such as Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or depression.] With no prevention or treatment, aged-related neurodegeneration could reach 11-16 million by 2050. In 2035, today's Veterans will be middle-aged, with health issues like those seen in aging Vietnam Veterans, complicated by comorbidities of posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and polytrauma. During neurodegeneration, the brain demonstrates region- specific alterations in neuronal morphology, reduced structural plasticity and dendritic branching, and a decreased capacity to regenerate. Brain function is underpinned by both electrical activity and chemical communication between neurons; this communication between cells is necessary for re-establishing normal brain function in the AD brain. In addition to genetic modulation that initiate neuronal growth, other interventions such as 1) selective serotonin and dopamine reuptake inhibition (SDRI) to promote cAMP, or 2) [neurotrophin receptor agonism] may promote structural and functional plasticity and improve behavior in individuals afflicted with AD. Proper neuronal growth and guidance is dependent upon communication from extracellular signals (i.e., spatial information) through the plasma membrane. A key plasmalemmal `hub' that transduces the extracellular cues to the underlying cytoskeletal machinery are membrane/lipid rafts (MLR), discrete microdomains enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, and scaffolding protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Neuronal polarization and motility is dependent upon MLR localized in its leading edge. We have previously demonstrated that neuron-targeted Cav-1 over-expression (achieved by linking it to a neuron-specific synapsin promoter [SynCav1]): 1) enhances membrane cholesterol, MLR formation, and synaptic receptor expression and signaling (TrkB); 2) increases serotonin receptor (5-HT6) and dopamine receptor-mediated (D1R) cAMP formation; 3) promotes dendritic sprouting and arborization even in the presence of growth inhibitors. A recent seminal publication from our group demonstrates that direct delivery of SynCav1 into the brain augments structural and functional hippocampal neuroplasticity in adult mice (6 mo) and aged mice (20 mo) and improves hippocampal-dependent contextual fear learning and memory in both adult and aged mice. These results provide proof-of-concept evidence that by increasing expression of Cav-1 specifically in neurons, one can improve structural and functional neuroplasticity with positive behavioral outcome. This application seeks to determine whether SynCav1 can induce similar neuroplastic changes in differentiated human neuronal stem cells (NSCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then to use SynCav1 in combination with SSRIs, SDRIs, or TrkB agonism to significantly augment the rate of behavioral improvement in AD mice. Our study will utilize a novel in vitro model of adult human differentiated neuronal stem cells (NSCs) derived form induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) combined with quantum dot axonal transport time- lapse imaging to assess neuronal function, and in vivo genetic interventions, pharmacological, and exercise therapeutic techniques, electrophysiology, confocal and scanning electron microscopy, and motor and cognitive batteries. Completion of the proposed experiments could lead to the justification of using novel therapeutic interventions (small molecules, peptides, gene manipulation) that target Cav-1 and MLR for the purpose of combating AD-associated neurodegeneration or nerve trauma in the Veteran population."
"9539409","Project Summary Influenza A virus (IAV) causes a significant global burden and the emergence of novel pandemic viruses is a constant threat heightened by increasing incidence of highly pathogenic avian IAV in migratory birds and poultry and cases of human transmission (e.g. H5N1, H7N9). Since seasonal vaccines are ineffective against emerging pandemic IAV strains and resistance to current licensed antivirals is easily acquired, the development of additional therapeutic strategies is required. Severe IAV infection evokes a robust inflammatory response leading to the uncontrolled production of cytokine and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, and the release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Excessive inflammation and oxidative insults to the lung result in significant neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar space, edema and hemorrhage from disrupted endothelial-epithelial cell barriers, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our lab discovered and synthesized novel lipid mediators (electrophilic fatty acid derivatives, EFADs) capable of broadly stabilizing inflammation through synchronously activating antioxidant responses and inhibiting inflammation. We postulate that EFADs will mitigate IAV-induced lung injury by promoting antioxidant responses and limiting inflammation. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two experimental aims. 1. Evaluate EFADs as therapeutics for IAV-induced lung injury 2. Determine the mechanisms of EFAD action in treating murine IAV pathogenesis This research plan combines analytical strategies including high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and flow cytometry, with tools to measure lung function and the host response to viral infection. These studies will yield a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions as pertaining to oxidative stress, the innate immune response and electrophilic lipid signaling. It is anticipated that novel signaling mechanisms will be revealed for the mitigation of respiratory infection and lung injury ? laying a strong foundation for new therapeutic strategies having broad implications in global health."
"9459313","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Umbilical cord blood (CB) has become a valuable source of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) for the treatment of cancer, but its utility continues to be restricted by the limited cell numbers and relative immaturity of CB allografts. Although numerous strategies have been proposed to increase the engraftment potential of CB cells, there is still no agreement over the best and most efficient way to achieve this critical log-term goal. The applicant's research group has shown that ex vivo culture of the entire CB unit with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) will significantly expand lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors, leading to faster times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment. This progress, together with emerging evidence that fucosylation of CB can improve both progenitor homing and engraftment times, has led to the current renewal application. Through a series of iterative clinical and mechanistic studies, the applicant now proposes three specific aims to bring the results of CB transplantation in line with those of bone marrow and peripheral blood transplantation. Aim 1: To further enhance the engraftment of CB by using a combination of ex vivo MSC-mediated expansion and fucosylation strategies. The underlying rationale of this clinical trial is that expansion and surface fucosylation of CB cells appear to shorten engraftment times by non-overlapping mechanisms, raising the possibility of potent synergistic activity leading to meaningful advances in outcome. Aim 2: To generate an expanded megakaryocyte (MK)-rich CB product that yields more rapid engratment, the applicant proposes to identify the progenitor subpopulation(s) among expanded CB cells that produces optimally rapid platelet recovery in an NSG mouse model, with a clinical trial planned if warranted by the experimental animal studies and other laboratory findings. Aim 3: To comprehensively characterize immune reconstitution in our CBT patients and determine whether it can be improved with systemic administration of IL- 7. By conducting a phase I/II clinical trial, the applicants will propose to est the safety and feasibility, as well as efficacy of systemic administration of IL-7, which has a pivotal role in T cell development and survival. Success in this project will provide means to manipulate CB-derived cells towards greater clinical advantage, thus broadening the impact of CB transplantation on the treatment of human cancers."
"9485202","Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the USA, mainly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques causing myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Excess activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is associated with vascular inflammation, atherosclerotic plaque rupture, and increased risk of MI and stroke. As MR activation is associated with obesity, heart failure, and hypertension, all very common health conditions, the majority of Americans may be at increased risk for MI and stroke due to inappropriate MR activation. Prior research in our lab and others indicates that MR in the vasculature promotes vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, while its inhibition results in smaller plaques and fewer adverse cardiovascular events in randomized clinical trials. In response to traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and, we have recently found, hyperlipidemia, the MR specifically within endothelial cells (EC-MR) mediates vascular dysfunction, which is widely known to be an early step in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. We have also found that EC-MR promotes leukocyte adhesion and trans-endothelial migration, suggesting a mechanism for how the MR promotes vascular inflammation. We therefore hypothesize that hyperlipidemia induces EC-MR to maladaptively activate intracellular pathways that promote endothelial permeability, thereby facilitating leukocyte trans-endothelial migration and vascular inflammation and contributing to development of atherosclerotic plaques with a phenotype that is prone to rupture. To investigate this hypothesis, we have developed a novel mouse model with the MR specifically deleted from endothelial cells, which we inject with a viral vector containing constitutively active PCSK9 to induce hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. In aim 1 of this proposal, we will investigate the role of EC-MR in plaque formation and morphology, vascular inflammation, and leukocyte trans-endothelial migration in vivo using this mouse model. In aim 2, we will treat isolated endothelial cells in culture with oxidized phospholipids to model atherogenic conditions and investigate intracellular signaling, cell-cell junction stability, and leukocyte trans- endothelial migration in vitro. Successful completion of our aims will result in substantial advances in our understanding of atherosclerosis and inflammation and could lead to novel therapies specifically targeting EC- MR to reduce atherosclerotic plaque burden and plaque rupture, drastically reducing the morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. This proposal also includes a detailed training plan including coursework, collaborations, presentations at national meetings, and integration of clinical training to prepare the PI for a successful career as a physician-scientist."
"9470246","Abstract The malignant brain tumor Glioblastoma (GBM) is a tragic illness for patients and families due to poor patient prognosis, with only 9.8% of patients surviving past 5 years. Only modest gains in survival have been made despite decades of research, therefore, a better understanding of the basic biology of this disease is needed to improve patient outcomes. Hypoxia is characteristic of GBM and many other tumors, and is increased by the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab, which is commonly used for recurrent GBM tumors. Metabolic changes contribute to adaptation to tumor hypoxia, and can be potentially targeted to reduce treatment resistance. Our preliminary data shows elevated levels of triglycerides and decreased levels of very long chain fatty acids in highly hypoxic tumors. This suggests the use of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation which primarily catabolizes very long chain fatty acids, as a fuel source in highly hypoxic tumors. In addition, previous studies show that hypoxia induces secretion of triglyceride-loaded extracellular vesicles in prostate cancer cells. Triglyceride-loaded extracellular vesicles may be a potential mechanism for delivering fuel sources to GBM cells during hypoxia. We hypothesize that GBM cells rely on peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride-loaded extracellular vesicle secretion to fuel tumor growth during hypoxia. We will investigate this hypothesis through our specific aims: 1) determine the effect of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in adaptation to hypoxia induced by anti-angiogenic treatment in GBM tumors, and 2) define the role of extracellular vesicle formation and lipid secretion in adaptation to hypoxia induced by anti-angiogenic treatment in GBM tumors. To address both of these specific aims, we will 1) determine the lipid metabolism effects of hypoxia on cells and extracellular vesicles in vitro using metabolomics and mRNA analysis, and 2) test the efficacy of combining inhibitors targeting peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation or triglyceride synthesis with anti-angiogenic treatment both in vitro and in vivo. When using these inhibitors, we expect to see 1) inhibition of cell growth in vitro in cells exposed to hypoxia, and 2) inhibition of tumor growth and extension of survival for tumors treated with anti-angiogenic treatment and our inhibitory agents, compared to either treatment alone. These studies are significant in that they will elucidate mechanisms for tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The identified mechanisms can be targeted and incorporated into innovative treatment regimens for GBM patients, potentially leading to substantial increases in survival and patient well-being."

"9457162","SUMMARY The goals of Dr. Pasinetti?s research is to investigate the biological processes that occur during aging when subjects with normal cognitive function convert into the very earliest stages of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and then to frank dementia. Dr. Pasinetti has published his pivotal work in 356 manuscripts in journals including Journal of Biochemistry, Nature, Neuron, and Cell. Dr. Pasinetti?s publications have an H impact factor of 64 and are cited 12,000 times according to Google Scholar. A brief synopsis of his research is provided below: 1) Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) Dr. Pasinetti identified T2D as one of the major risk factors that might affect AD neuropathology and synaptic plasticity in part through epigenetic mechanisms. In a recent genome wide association study, we found a subpopulation of individuals with T2D have a genetic predisposition to AD based on the evidence of shared common T2D/AD single nucleotide polymorphisms in gene pathways involved in chromatin modification enzymes, among others. These studies will provide the basis for novel therapeutic targets towards the preservation of cognitive health in a subset of T2D subjects at risk for developing AD. 2) Drug discover and repurposing. Neurotoxic oligomeric ?-amyloid (A?) peptides and misfolded tau have been implicated in disruption of synaptic plasticity, contributing in part to mechanisms underlying onset and progression of cognitive deterioration and eventually AD dementia. Using a structure-activity relationship (SAR) approach, Dr. Pasinetti?s laboratory is ?reconstructing? novel antihypertensive drugs lacking cardiovascular side effects but with enhanced anti-A? oligomerization activity. Repurposing drugs has several advantages over novel drugs since they are already well-characterized in respect to tolerability and safety profile. 3) Biomarkers of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dr. Pasinetti identified biomarkers to help diagnose two of the major ?signature injuries? of the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: mTBI and PTSD. Dr. Pasinetti?s lab reported differential expression of four non-coding micro RNAs in Veterans able to distinguish subjects with PTSD but not TBI. Such biomarkers could provide novel benchmarks in patient selection with comorbid TBI/PTSD who are also at high risk for AD. 4) Molecular Integrative Neuroresilience. Dr. Pasinetti was awarded a P50 Research Center Grant on ?Molecular Integrative Neuroresilience? with the primary goal of understanding the mechanisms through which recently identified polyphenolic compounds may promote resilience against stress-induced psychological and cognitive impairment. Most importantly, the lab is currently leveraging the Research Center Activities in mechanistic investigations related to safety and efficacy studies aimed at preventative and therapeutic approaches to promote cognitive and psychological resilience in Gulf War Illness Veterans with polyphenolic ?natural drugs? compounds in collaboration with the VA War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC). 5) Caregivers Health Program. Dr. Pasinetti?s lab investigated whether a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training course for caregivers may improve the psychological resilience of non-professional caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients. In transcriptomic studies we found a panel of 91 ??predictor?? biomarker genes whose contents in PBMCs prior to mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) predicted the likelihood of caregiver subjects to benefit from the intervention with 94.7% accuracy. These studies provide insight into the mechanisms of health benefits of MBSR and a basis for developing a personalized medicine approach for applying MBSR for promoting psychological and cognitive resilience in caregivers of dementia patients, especially VA caregivers, who are at high risk for stress-induced psychological and cognitive impairment. Taken together, the focus of Dr. Pasinetti?s research determining the molecular basis of neurodegenerative disorders and targets for novel therapies is highly relevant to the mission of the VA with the ultimate goal of identifying novel treatment strategies that can be translated to improve the care of Veterans."

"9553352","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Cancer is a leading health problem for United States Veterans. While most cancers are treatable in their earliest forms, gender-related cancers including those of the ovary, breast, and  prostate are often fatal when diagnosed at advanced and/or metastatic stages. It is estimated that in 2015, these cancers will account for over 80,000 annual deaths in the general population, with morbidity rates significantly higher in the Veteran population. Many patients initially respon to treatment, but often relapse. Relapse may be due to the heterogeneous nature of the tumor, dysregulation of various signaling pathways, aberrant lectin- carbohydrates, or development of aggressive and drug resistant tumors. The best was to identify and treat these cancers may be through implementation of a more personally tailored diagnostic and/or therapeutic approach in which agents that target multiple biomarkers on cancer cells are employed. However, surprisingly few tumor-associated antigens or biomarkers have been shown to associate with cancer type or stage. Our laboratory has previously utilized bacteriophage (phage) display technology to identify biomarkers and isolate peptide-based targeting molecules that recognize ovarian, breast, and prostate carcinomas. Peptides that target the ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 receptors, carbohydrates (Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen, TF), lectins (galectin- 3, gal-3), and the CD44 splice variant CD44v6, have been obtained. These biomarkers are involved in cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and signaling. TF is expressed in over 90% of all adenocarcinomas, gal-3 is a marker of invasiveness and metastatic potential, ErbB-2 is a marker of aggressive metastasis, ErbB-3 often associates with poor prognosis and treatment resistance, and CD44v6 associates with aggressive cancer initiating (stem) cells (CIC). The ability to detect such biomarkers in vivo  will help discern various stages of tumor progression and may help monitor response to therapy.  The targeting and imaging of cancer biomarkers has generally relied on the use of radiolabeled antibodies (Abs). Unfortunately, Abs are very large and often cause immunogenic related toxicity and drug resistance. Small peptides are well tolerated in humans but suffer from low tumor uptake, instability, and high kidney retention. Peptides displayed in the context of small scaffolds or single chain Ab fragments (scFv) may provide ideal platforms for development of efficacious tumor targeting agents due to their high affinity, stability, and favorable in vivo pharmacokinetics. It is hypothesized that the phage display selected gal-3/TF, ErbB- 2/ErbB-3, and CD44v6 peptides can be engineered into high affinity, stable, targeting scaffolds to be used in the imaging and response to therapy of ovary, breast, and prostate cancer.  The goal of these studies is to develop ErbB-2/ErbB-3 and gal-3/TF-targeting peptides and newly identified CD44v6-targeting peptides into personalized cancer detection or therapy agents. The objectives of this proposed research are to: 1) functionally characterize the peptides for the interruption of  signaling pathways and proliferation in vitro and within human breast, ovary, or prostate carcinomas; 2) develop new generation of peptides tailored to radioimaging/therapy applications by: i) synthesis of retro-inverso and multiple antigen peptide constructs, ii) engineering peptides  into novel scFv scaffolds, and iii) generating phage display scFv libraries for affinity maturation 3) simultaneous target multiple biomarkers using fluorescence imaging for streamlining the development of cancer detection probes, and 4) perform in vivo biodistribution and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 64Cu (or 68Ga)-labeled scaffolds to evaluate as in vivo radiodiagnostic and/or response to therapy agents.  Our work will positively impact healthcare in that we are developing targeted agents for the detection and treatment of cancer. The peptide-based agents will be well tolerated in vivo and help improve the lives of our Veterans. This research coincides with BLR&D special interests of Women's Health and Genomic Medicine."
"9458784","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder that affects approximately 100,000 people in the USA, primarily of African descent. Single E6V mutation in b-globin gene leads to the production of hemoglobin S (HbS) and development of chronic hemolytic anemia. Our recent analysis of a national hospital discharge survey showed an association of SCD with lower frequency of HIV-1 diagnosis (odds ratio 0.33) suggesting that SCD might offer a protection from HIV-1. We hypothesize that hemolytic anemia in SCD leads to inhibition of HIV-1 transcription through the activation of heme-, iron and oxygen-dependent pathways. Heme induces transcription of iron regulatory genes in macrophages, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), ferritin and iron export protein, ferroportin leading to the increased iron export and reduction of cellular iron. In SCD, expression of HO-1 is increased whereas expression of hepcidin that regulates internalization and degradation of ferroportin is decreased (and also our preliminary data). Induction of HO-1 by heme inhibits HIV-1 infection in macrophages and T-cells in vitro and in HIV-1 infected humanized mice. We have previously shown that HIV-1 transcription is inhibited by iron chelators or ferroportin. Iron chelators inhibi cellular activities of CDK2 and CDK9, both critical for HIV-1 transcription. Our recent findings demonstrate that CDK2 directly phosphorylates CDK9's Ser90 resulting in the activation of HIV-1 transcription. We, therefore, hypothesize that increased blood heme concentration, ischemia and decreased hepcidin will elevate levels and activity of HO-1 and ferroportin, reduce cellular iron and upregulate HIF-1 pathway leading to the induction of Egr-1, p21 and inhibition of CDK2 and CDK9. Upregulation of this protein network will lead to the inhibition HIV-1 transcription and viral replication in SCD condition. In Specific Aim 1, we will analyze HIV-1 inhibition in SCD and SCD trait. In Specific Aim 2, we will analyze molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 inhibition in SCD and SCD trait. In Specific Aim 3, we will analyze novel inhibitors HO-1, ferroportin and hepcidin pathways in vivo. Collectively, our proposed research is designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 inhibition in the settings of SCD and SCD trait. Our studies will uncover novel mechanisms of HIV-1 regulation by heme, ferroportin, hepcidin, and iron. Our proposed studies are significant because they may lead to novel therapeutics, such as the use of hemin and iron chelators."
"9487873","SMALL NON-CODING RNA REGULATION OF RAS-GTPase FUNCTION in EPIDERMAL HOMEOSTASIS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Ras-MAPK signal transduction pathway is a critical regulator of the epidermis as dysregulation of Ras- MAPK signaling inhibits epidermal differentiation and is a major driver of tumorigenesis. Our recent discovery that snoRNAs directly interact with and regulate Ras function represents a major paradigm shift in our understanding of small GTPase regulation. Using our novel UV-C cross-linking and immunoprecipitation platform, irCLIP, to characterize transcriptome wide RAS-superfamily GTPase interactions with RNA, we have discovered a rich and complex web of snoRNA-RAS-GTPase interactions suggesting that snoRNAs may regulate all biological processes under RAS-superfamily control, including biochemical signaling nodes, actin/membrane organization, vesicular and intracellular protein trafficking and nuclear/cytoplasmic transport. The long term goals of this K01 application are to deeply characterize the regulatory functions and mechanisms of action of small nucelolar RNAs in modulation of Ras and RAS-superfamily GTPases in control of epidermal homeostasis.  In Aim I, we will focus on defining the specificity and breadth of C/D box snoRNA modulation of RAS- superfamily GTPase functions. Our preliminary irCLIP-seq data showed that members of all 5 RAS-subfamilies, RAS, RHO, ARF, RAB and RAN, directly interacted with SNORD50A/B. Thus SNORD50A/B may be a global repressor of RAS-superfamily GTPases as has been described for K-Ras. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, SNORD50A/B loss-of-function studies will test RAS-GTPase activation levels of 9 RAS-superfamily GTPases spanning all 5 subfamilies. Activation status of biochemical pathways downstream of active-RAS-GTPases will also be monitored with IP-kinase assays and/or phospho-immunoblots when applicable. Our irCLIP-seq data also revealed that Ras isoforms interacted with >20 C/D box snoRNAs, several of which are amplified in cancer. This supports the hypothesis that multiple snoRNAs participate in the regulation of Ras function. In Aim IB, we will use CRISPR-mediated gene editing to excise select Ras-interacting snoRNAs from primary human keratinocytes and assess loss-of-function via analysis of Ras-GTP levels, ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation levels, and on epidermal homeostasis in 3D human tissue models. Together, this aim will reveal the extent to which C/D box snoRNAs regulate Ras and RAS-superfamily GTPase functions.  Aim II is designed to functionally characterize the RNA-dependent Ras protein interactome. Because of their ability to suppress interaction of Ras with farnesyltransferase, we hypothesized that SNORD50A/B function as adaptors to modulate specific Ras-protein interactions. Using a tandem affinity purification and proximal protein biotinylation (BioID) approach, we compared the interactomes of WT to mutant Ras against WT Ras in a SNORD50A/B +/+ or -/- background. This led to a distilled list of protein interactions that were altered in a SNORD50A/B-specific manner and support the hypothesis that SNORD50A/B regulate vesicular trafficking of Ras from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. CRISPR-mediated loss-of-function studies will be used to assess how these candidate factors contribute to regulation of Ras in control of epidermal homeostasis in 3D tissue models. In a manner orthogonal and complementary to Aim IIA, I will identify global RNA- dependent Ras protein interactions in Aim IIB. SDS-PAGE resolution of irCLIP-adaptor ligated Ras-RNA complexes support the hypothesis that additional proteins are being co-purified with Ras in an RNA-dependent manner. Aim IIB will use our novel irCLIP-mass-spectrometry method to identify these factors. Taken together, this aim will serve to functionally characterize and broaden our understanding of how RNA organizes Ras protein complexes to control epidermal homeostasis."
"9462792","Core E: Outreach, Recruitment & Education Core Project Summary/Abstract The Outreach, Recruitment and Education (ORE) Core has two primary goals that drive the aims of the core and its strategy for implementing successful programs. The primary goal is to recruit and retain research participants that meet the requirements of the ADRC cohorts, the projects and pilots of the ADRC, and clinical studies and trials. The ORE Core will support recruitment and retention in all ADRC cohorts (longitudinal, Down syndrome, and 90+ Autopsy Study) through innovative and customized public events, physician outreach, newsletters, digital communications, and retention/appreciation events. In addition, the ORE Core will expand recruitment efforts to support the newly established iPS Cell Core and the proposed AmBER registry Amyloid Biomarker Enrichment Registry (see Clinical Core.) Biweekly meetings are held between the ORE and Clinical Cores to set recruitment goals and monitor progress. The ORE Core will build on the successes of the past grant cycle by honing data collection and tracking systems to improve recruitment efforts, such as targeting physicians for additional referrals to the ADRC, and maximizing traffic on the ADRC website to convert visitors to participants. Minority recruitment will continue to be a focus of the ORE Core, and we will engage our community partners, local referring physicians, and our current minority participants to help us double current Chinese-American enrollment into the longitudinal cohort, to a goal of 30%. In addition, the Down Syndrome cohort will increase Latino enrollment, to a goal of 21%, reflecting our community demographics. Our secondary goal is the education and training of scientific investigators and clinicians and the programmatic education of Orange County's lay and professional community about AD, the mission of the UCI ADRC, and the importance and impact of research. We will develop and coordinate educational programs for UCI students, staff, and faculty to enhance collaboration and education. We will continue our annual Southern California Alzheimer s Disease Research Conference, now in our 25th year, participate in the annual ADC symposium with the other local ADCs, and develop a new speakers bureau. Finally, the ORE Core recognizes the importance of centeredness and will continue to develop cross-core collaborations that are cohesive to the overall objectives of the UCI ADRC and advance the specific aims of each core."
"9447725","Abstract  Latency permits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) to colonize its hosts for their lifetime by avoiding immune detection and clearance. The abilities of the virus to persist latently and reactivate productively are major factors in the serious medical issues caused by HCMV infections. HCMV is latent in undifferentiated myeloid cells and reactivates when these cells differentiate. The Immediate Early 1 (IE1) protein is a transcription factor that promotes progression through the viral lytic phase. During latency the levels of lytic (productive) phase proteins such as IE1 are kept extremely low (or completely absent) because the promoter that drives its expression, the Major Immediate Early Promoter (MIEP) is transcriptionally silenced by heterochromatin. Premature triggering of the lytic cycle in undifferentiated myeloid cells by spurious production of proteins like IE1 likely results in immune destruction of the reactivating cell before HCMV can complete a productive round of replication. Keeping full length IE1 protein levels low or absent protects latently infected cells from immune surveillance and restricts reactivation events until the cell differentiates. Our lab demonstrated the cellular protein Daxx and an associated histone deacetylase (HDAC) silences the MIEP when HCMV establishes latency. Likewise, we also published that the viral UL138 protein silences IE1 transcription during latency by inhibiting the recruitment of lysine-specific demethylases (KDMs) to the MIEP that remove repressive epigenetic histone methylations to activate transcription. In Aim 1, we propose to define how UL138 prevents KDM recruitment to the MIEP and silences IE1 transcription during latency from its localization at the Golgi apparatus. Deletion of UL138 from the HCMV genome revealed that at least one more suppressor of IE1 transcription is encoded by clinical strains. Such functional redundancy in silencing the MIEP underscores the importance of this process for the worldwide success of HCMV. We have now identified this novel silencer of IE transcription. In Aim 2 we propose to determine how it represses the MIEP during latency. Knowing how the MIEP is silenced during latency should reveal mechanisms through which IE1 transcription can be controlled to either inhibit or induce reactivation from latency for therapeutic effect."
"9431050","Melanoma, one of the deadliest cancer of skin, arises from melanocytic cells that are responsible for melanin production. Recent advances in the understanding of melanoma biology has led to the development of targeted therapies with promise. For example, BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib achieved significant improvement over chemotherapy and were approved for metastatic melanomas with BRAF- mutations. More recently, the combination of dabrafenib with MEK inhibitor trametinib demonstrated improved progression-free survival, compared to monotherapy, and has received approval from the US FDA. However, even with the combination treatment, most of the patients develop acquired resistance, thereby failing to achieve lasting tumor regression. Therefore, novel target-based approaches are needed for the management of melanomas. The mammalian sirtuins constitute a family of seven known members (SIRT1 ? SIRT7) with NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase and/or ADP-ribosyltransferase activities]. In addition, they are also known to regulate post-translational acyl modifications. SIRTs play critical roles in important cellular processes, and are shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including cancer. The role of SIRTs in cancer is extremely complex and they appears to have dichotomous functions depending on cell contexts. Among known SIRTs, SIRT3 is a mitochondrial sirtuin, which coordinates global shift in mitochondrial activity by deacetylating proteins involved in diverse mitochondrial functions. It also plays important roles in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including transcription, insulin secretion, and apoptosis. The fact that SIRT3 can regulate several cellular processes which are critical in cancer cell proliferation, makes it a potential therapeutic target for cancer management. While the research on the role of SIRT3 in cancer is still in its infancy, studies have suggested its tumor suppressor as well as tumor promoter roles. However, the role of SIRT3 in melanoma is not known. In our preliminary data, we have found that SIRT3 is overexpressed in melanoma and its inhibition results in a significant anti-proliferative response in melanoma cells. Further, we have also found that 4'-bromo-resveratrol (4BR), a new small molecule inhibitor of SIRT3, imparts anti- proliferative effects in human melanoma cells. Thus, based on available literature and our preliminary data, we propose to test the hypothesis that SIRT3 plays a critical role in melanoma progression via modulating p53 signaling, Ku70-Bax interaction and/or cellular metabolic homeostasis. The following specific aims are proposed: 1) o define the role of SIRT3 in melanoma development and progression, employing a tissue microarray (TMA) created from retrospective melanoma tissues from veteran patients, and an in vitro cell transformation model; 2) to define the involvement of p53 signaling, Ku70-Bax interaction, cellular metabolic homeostasis, as downstream determinants of SIRT3 in melanoma cells; and 3) to determine the therapeutic significance of SIRT3 inhibition in vivo in 1) Braf-Pten mouse melanoma mode, and patient derived xenografts (PDX) developed with prospectively collected metastatic melanoma tissues from veteran patients. We expect that the outcome of studies proposed in this application may define the role and mechanism of SIRT3 in melanocytic transformation and melanoma progression. This may ultimately lead to development of novel diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic approaches for melanoma. Since melanoma incidence seems to be higher in the veteran population and our proposed study aimed at defining the molecular mechanism of melanoma development may lead to identification of novel strategies for the management of this deadly neoplasm. Therefore, our proposed work is relevant and significant to the health care of Veterans and is in line with the mission of the Department of Veteran Affairs."
"9566497","Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) has the potential to cure patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and other hematologic malignancies; however, it is limited by significant treatment-related morbidity, and mortality ranges from 20-30%. The main cause of treatment-related mortality is graft versus host disease (GVHD), in which the transplanted donor immune cells (graft) attack patient tissues (host). GVHD affects approximately half of HCT patients despite the use of standard prophylactic drugs. There is an urgent need for new prophylactic agents targeting novel pathways. While traditional prophylactic agents focus on T cells, emerging evidence suggests an important role for the innate immune system. Neutrophil elastase (NE) drives local and systemic inflammation by cleaving and releasing proteoglycans such as heparan sulfate (HS). Our group has shown that HS stimulates alloreactive T- cell responses, leading to inflammation and GVHD. Given the role of NE and HS in the pathogenesis of GVHD, a NE inhibitor may successfully block this pathway before development of GVHD. AZD9668 is a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of NE that is being studied for treatment of pulmonary chronic GVHD (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02669251, PI: Pavletic (proposal co-PI)). Given its low toxicity profile in 12 completed clinical trials with over 1000 patients studied, AZD9668 may be a safe and effective prophylactic strategy to inhibit NE, reduce heparan sulfate, prevent GVHD, and improve survival. UG3: Our goal is to use our murine HCT model to test the hypothesis that AZD9668 prevents GVHD. Positive results would support progression to phase 1c and 2 clinical trials. As part of this preclinical trial, we will determine the role of HS, desmosine (an elastin degradation product) and other potential biomarkers of NE activity and GVHD to support future clinical trials UH3: The first goal is to determine the optimal dose and safety of AZD9668 in a phase 1c trial of HCT patients. Our second goal is to test the hypothesis that AZD9668 reduces GVHD in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. In addition to evaluating efficacy and safety, we will also evaluate biomarkers of target modulation and GVHD. Our group has a strong track record of milestone-driven science, spanning the gamut from lab discovery to product development to clinical trials, and experience with INDs and industry collaborations culminating in the successful completion of projects. We have expertise with the murine models described in the UG3, including NE inhibition to decrease heparan sulfate and prevent GVHD, as well as clinical trial experience with GVHD prophylaxis and treatment , including with the study drug. We are perfectly positioned to partner with AstraZeneca to test a new therapeutic use AZD9668 for GVHD prophylaxis."
"9473805","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIT is a severe autoimmune disorder that predisposes to arterial and venous thrombosis. HIT is notable for several reasons, including the remarkable prevalence of otherwise immunologically healthy individuals exposed to heparin who develop self-reactive antibodies to a normal host protein, PF4, when it is released following platelet activation. Current clinical challenges in HIT include over-diagnosis and over-treatment and well as the risks of anticoagulating patients with thrombocytopenia and other hemostatic challenges such as recent surgery. In this proposed study, we will try to obtain in-depth understanding of the pathogenic ternary complex using crystallographic studies. We will try to expand our understanding of the PF4 tetramerization process and the creation of a novel type of antigenic epitope. We will try to develop a panel of PF4 mutants in different states of oligomerization that may provide a more reliable diagnostic method. We will also humanize RTO, maintain its PF4-monomer binding ability, but minimize the human immune response in preparation for potential future clinical studies."
"9471311","This is a competitive renewal of our currently funded project that focused on the impact of dietary amino acids on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) function. Our data demonstrates that amino acids have varying anabolic or catabolic effects. There are 20 common dietary amino acids and our data demonstrates that the aromatic amino acids have the most potent anabolic effects, particularly in the aging mouse model. Aging (24-month-old) C57BL/6 mice fed a low protein diet lose bone but this loss is prevented by dietary supplementation of aromatic amino acids. Our central hypothesis is that AAs are not just fuel, broken down to provide ATP for cell function, but rather that AAs normally function as ?nutritional hormones? binding to extracellular receptors and activating cell signaling pathways. Our data are consistent with the aging process resulting in the loss of the ability of BMSCs to ?sense? these normal anabolic signals from nutrients through epigenetic mechanisms. Further aging is associated with the accumulation of toxic breakdown products of these metabolites that interfere with their normal anabolic actions. We propose to characterize these nutrient related changes so as to develop effective countermeasures. Therefore, the specific aims of the proposal are: (1) Test the hypothesis that age-induced epigenetic changes in stem cells resulting in impaired function can be reversed by dietary interventions; and (2) Test the hypothesis that age-induced epigenetic changes in stem cells resulting in impaired function can be reproduced by dietary interventions. This project also will explore synergize with the other projects included in this application looking at effects of these amino acids and metabolites in aging muscle (Project 2), inflammatory cytokines (Project 3) and histone deacetylation (Project 4)."
"9473653","The skeleton, populated by large numbers of osteoblasts and osteocytes, requires a constant supply of energy-rich molecules to fuel the: synthesis, deposition, and mineralization of bone matrix during bone modeling and remodeling. As a result, studies performed over the last decade have expanded our understanding of the physiologic functions of bone beyond locomotion, mineral ion storage, and protection of vital organs to now include the secretion of hormones that contribute to the regulation of whole-body metabolism. Sclerostin, an osteocyte-secreted factor that inhibits Wnt signaling by interacting with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (Lrp5) and Lrp6 co-receptors, has generally been viewed as a local inhibitor of bone formation. However, human data raises the possibility that sclerostin also antagonizes Wnt signaling in distant tissues as circulating levels are increased in conditions of metabolic dysfunction. Moreover, preliminary studies described in this proposal demonstrate that sclerostin deficiency (Sost-/- mice) alters body composition and glucose homeostasis, and that sclerostin treatment augments adipocyte differentiation. These data lead us to hypothesize that sclerostin fulfills an endocrine function that allows bone to communicate with other metabolically active tissues, and to contribute to the coordination of whole body metabolism. In this application, we will utilize a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to explore the impact of sclerostin on adipose tissue development and function. Our hypothesis predicts that circulating sclerostin enhances fat accumulation by suppressing signaling downstream of the Wnt co- receptor Lrp5 and that this function is facilitated by Lrp4, a putative sclerostin receptor. Our approach will enable the identification of previously unanticipated functions of sclerostin. We firmly believe that the information gained from our studies will improve understanding of how the metabolic activity of the skeleton impacts global metabolic activity. Such information is expected to significantly improve the diagnosis, management, treatment, and prevention of the related metabolic disturbances of diabetes and bone disease in aging Veterans."

"9471314","Bone mass, strength, and marrow adiposity are linked in physiological and pathophysiological conditions including aging and altered nutrition, as both aging and nutrient deprivation lead to osteopenia with a concomitant increase in bone marrow fat that elevates fracture risk. Recent studies show that conditional deletion of the epigenetic enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3) in osteoblast progenitors mimics this phenomenon, causing osteopenia, skeletal fragility, and increased marrow adiposity even in young animals. Unifying these observations, preliminary studies establish that Hdac3 expression and activity are reduced in bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC)-derived osteoprogenitors from aged humans and aged wild-type mice as compared to young controls. Lipid droplet formation is abundant in both aged and young Hdac3-depleted BMSC-derived osteoblast cultures, which preliminary data suggest is due in part to mechanisms of lipid storage by committed osteoblast lineage cells. This transformative paradigm suggests that osteoprogenitors are epigenetically primed to store lipids when Hdac3 levels decline, and that these lipid-containing cells constitute a distinct component of marrow adipose tissue. Preliminary data suggest that age-related suppression of Hdac3 is downstream of aging- related stimuli and upstream of deleterious changes in BMSC and osteoblast function that reduce bone density and increase marrow adiposity. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that Hdac3 governs the propensity for lipid storage by osteoprogenitors at the expense of bone formation, contributing to decreased bone mass and increased marrow fat with age. The significance of this line of research is that Hdac3 and its downstream modulators of lipid storage represent novel targets for treatment and prevention of age-related bone loss, possibly through modulation of nutrient-related stimuli. The objective of the proposed research is to uncover the physiological and molecular mechanisms by which Hdac3 regulates lipid storage in osteoblast progenitors with aging and altered nutrition. Animal models and in vitro experiments with murine and human primary and immortalized cell lines will define relationships between age, Hdac3 expression, and conditions that increase marrow fat and decrease bone mass. Expected outcomes include the identification of aging-related stimuli that suppress expression of Hdac3 in osteoprogenitors as targets for preventing osteoblast dysfunction with age, and determination of how loss of Hdac3 in osteoprogenitors affects key cellular processes directly related to bone formation and lipid storage."
"9462720","CLINICAL CORE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The mission of the Clinical Core parallels that of the MADRC as a whole: To support research into the causes, mechanisms and treatment of AD and related dementias, with the eventual goal of curing and even preventing these disorders. When first established in 1984, much of our work centered on AD, beginning with AD dementia and expanding to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The focus broadened over the past 5 years as investigators in the Core developed specific research programs in vascular cognitive impairment, Parkinson disease dementia/dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia. We now expand our Core's focus further to emphasize the behavioral and biological features of normal elders at risk for dementia and those with subjective cognitive concerns. In order to facilitate clinical research in these areas, we have established and maintain a Longitudinal Cohort (LC) of men and women from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds spanning a full range of cognitive function from normal to subjective complaints to MCI to dementia. Comprehensive and systematic examination of this cohort is central to the Clinical Core mission. From this well-characterized and longitudinally followed cohort, we provide timely and accurate data submission to NACC; subjects for national multi-center studies such as ADNI, DIAN and ADCS trials; and biological samples for genetic and biomarker research. The LC also fuels our Center's local research studies: we will continue to support the more than 40 studies that rely on our evaluations and our subjects, their data and/or their biologic fluids for success, including Projects 1 and 2 in this renewal application. A special emphasis of our Core, in line with our Center's theme of understanding and recognizing the earliest phase of disease, is the development of novel assessment tools that can be used in our and others' studies in this area. We will also work on referring subjects to the new Neuroimaging Core, on supporting the new Recruitment Registry in the Outreach Core, and on coordinating with the Neuropathology Core to facilitate smooth autopsy protocols. The Core will join with the Outreach Core in raising awareness about AD and dementias, and assist in increasing the number of minority subjects who have access to LC and research projects. A final goal of the Core is help train the next generation of investigators, and we will continue to attract promising clinician-scientists and provide a stimulating environment for their career development."
"9552677","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Whether hyperinsulinemia directly contributes to kidney injury by insulin receptor (IR) activation in hyperinsulinemic insulin resistant states, e.g., obesity is not known. Our novel pilot data show (1) In C57BL6 mice, high fat diet (HFD) led to renal cortical IR activation, increase in matrix protein, albuminuria, and mTORC1 activation along with weight gain, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia but normal blood glucose. We have generated the kidney proximal tubular IR knock out mice (KPTIRKO) in which HFD-induced IR activation, matrix increment, albuminuria and mTORC1 signaling were reduced. (2) Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is normally synthesized in the kidney by cystathionine ? lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ? synthase (CBS). In WT mice HFD reduced the renal content of CSE and CBS but not in KPTIRKO mice suggesting that IR activation in HFD reduces CBS and CSE as a part of renal injury. (3) HFD decreased renal CSE and CBS content but not their mRNA; in vitro insulin decreased CSE and CBS protein but not mRNA in proximal tubular epithelial (MCT) cells. These data suggest non-transcriptional regulation of CSE and CBS by insulin. Although our data suggest a role for IR in HFD-associated kidney injury, the requirement of reduced H2S generation is not known. Hypothesis: In hyperinsulinemic insulin resistant state induced by high fat diet, renal insulin receptor activation contributes to kidney injury by reduced generation of hydrogen sulfide. Aim 1. To test if H2S administration ameliorates HFD-induced kidney injury in mice. 3-month old male and female C57BL6 mice will be randomized to normal fat diet (NFD) or HFD for 4 months. Once the kidney injury (albuminuria) is established, we will administer sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a H2S donor, at 30umoles/l drinking water for 3 months. The following studies will be done: Structural changes: renal hypertrophy, immunohistochemistry, mRNA/protein analysis of matrix proteins. Functional changes: albuminuria, FITC inulin clearance. Signaling studies: IR activation, signaling reactions that control protein synthesis. Aim 2. (A) To test if augmented H2S production protects against HFD-induced kidney injury. We will randomize male and female 3-month old WT and transgenic mice overexpressing human CBS in the proximal tubule (PThCBS tg, generated by us) to NFD or HFD for 4 months. Studies will be done as in Aim 1. (B) To test if HFD-induced kidney injury is amplified in mice deficient in H2S production. We will randomize male and female 3-month old WT and CSEKO mice that are in our possession to NFD or HFD for 4 months. Structural, functional and signaling studies will be done as in Aim 1. Aim 3. To explore the mechanism of insulin-induced reduction in CSE, CBS expression. (A) In vivo studies: Pilot data show that HFD reduced the renal CSE and CBS expression by non-transcriptional regulation. We will explore if this is due to failure to translate their mRNA by performing Polysome assay on renal preparations from C57BL6 mice on NFD and HFD at 4 months of diet. Changes in the expression lysosomal and proteasomal pathway proteins will be measured. (B) In vitro studies: High insulin inhibited CSE and CBS protein in MCT cells in vitro by non-transcriptional mechanism, similar to in vivo data. Employing 1 and 10 nM insulin as high insulin in MCT cells, we will explore if this is due to (i) failure of translation of mRNA by Polysome assay, and/or, (ii) if this is due to increase in degradation by measuring the degradation of radiolabeled CSE and CBS by pulse chase. We will test if augmented degradation is via proteasomal mechanism by measuring proteasomal activity and proteasomal subunit protein and mRNA expression. We will employ bortezomib, MG132 and siRNA for proteasomal subunits. Recent studies show that mTORC1 stimulates protein degradation by proteasome pathway. We will explore role of mTOR in CSE and CBS degradation. We will also test if high insulin stimulates lysosomal pathway to augment CSE and CBS degradation by employing chloroquine or siRNA against Atg7."

"9433020","Abstract Understanding the nanoscale organizations of biomolecules in complex biological systems such as the brain, can not only provide fundamental biological insights but also help in the discovery of new targets and technologies for treating diseases. Optical microscopy provides a convenient way for imaging biological samples using readily available dyes/antibodies. However, the spatial resolution of conventional optical microscopes is limited to 300 nm due to the diffraction of light waves. On the other hand, existing super-resolution optical techniques, face challenges in scalability to thick tissues and require extremely expensive hardware, which limits their application. Recently discovered expansion microscopy (ExM), which is based on physically expanding the sample (embedded in a swellable gel) by about 4.5 x and thus, achieving an effective resolution of 70 nm, is scalable and compatible with conventional optical hardware. But, its resolution of 70 nm is not sufficient for observing subcellular structures. Though the resolution can be improved through iterated ExM (iExM), it results in low biomolecular yield as it requires transfer of biomolecules from one gel to another, with the cleaving of the first gel. The proposed work aims to develop a technology for expansion, where gel cleaving or transfer of biomolecules is not required, resulting in high biomolecular yields. This technology utilizes both electrostatic and mechanical forces for expansion to achieve high expansion factors (20x to 100x), thus leading to 300 / 20 ? 15 nm to 300 / 100 ? 3 nm resolution. This technology, which I termed non-cleaved electro-mechanical expansion (NEME) is different from previous expansion technologies which utilizes only electrostatic forces for expansion. The mentored phase of the proposed work will involve the development and characterization of the NEME technology while in the independent phase, NEME will be extended for imaging of dense protein complexes as well as RNA and DNA. NEME technology can lead to super-resolution imaging without any specialized or expensive hardware and can also provide high biomolecular yields and scalability to thick tissues. Thus, it can greatly benefit simultaneous characterization of super-fine biomolecular structures and large 3D biological systems."

"9501090","ABSTRACT:  Organ banking has the potential to revolutionize the way organs are used for transplantation. Rewarming organs such as kidneys from the vitrified state is a critical step in obtaining successful cryopreservation. This would allow improved allocation, transport, and recipient preparation prior to transplant, while simultaneously providing a missing link in the potential supply chain for other engineered tissues. Typical freezing processes cause significant damage to biomaterials through ice crystal formation and cellular dehydration. However, with the aid of cryoprotectant (CPA) solutions, biospecimens can be stabilized in the vitreous (i.e. ?glass? or ?amorphous?) or ice free state, allowing for long-term cryopreservation. Our collaborator and consultant Dr. Greg Fahy has been able to vitrify rabbit kidneys since the 1980s. However, successful rewarming of these vitrified kidneys has remained a challenge to translation of vitirification for organ banking. Specifically, achieving critical warming rates (tens to hundreds of oC/min) necessary to avoid devitirification (i.e. crystallization) during warming has not been possible. In addition, achieving these rates in a sufficiently uniform fashion throughout the organ is also required to avoid thermal stresses that can crack the brittle material, and so both speed and uniformity of warming are of critical importance.  Here we propose to investigate the ability of radiofrequency heated magnetic nanoparticles, or ?nanowarming,? to overcome this major limitation hindering further development of bulk cryopreservation of kidneys. Although electromagnetic rewarming has been tried, the direct coupling of the waves to tissue will inherently result in non-uniformity in heating, which leads to crystallization, cracking and differential viability. At lower radiofrequencies (RF < 1 MHz) alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) can uniformly penetrate tissues without attenuation and negligible dielectric coupling. Although these lower frequency fields will be unable to rapidly heat the tissue on their own, they are able to produce significant heating through coupling with magnetic (e.g. iron-oxide) nanoparticles. We have already demonstrated that this approach can generate heating rates rapid enough to avoid devitirification in most CPAs of interest (up to 200 oC/min) and should scale independent of sample size.  The objective of this study is to refine this novel nanowarming technology for use in cryopreserving kidneys for transplant. To this end, in Aim 1 we will physically characterize CPA and nanoparticle mixtures to heat rabbit and larger mammalian kidneys. In Aim 2 we will demonstrate our ability to perfuse this CPA and nanoparticle combination into rabbit kidneys, vitrify and nanowarm while maintaining viability, cellular function and structural tissue integrity. Finally, in Aim 3 we will demonstate in vivo function after vitrification and nanowarming by transplant in rabbits and scaling for use in human kidneys  In summary, the focus of this proposal will be to leverage our breakthrough nanowarming technology by optimizing CPA composition and nanoparticle delivery in rabbit kidneys with proof of principle work to scale up to porcine and human kidneys for eventual clinical kidney banking and transplantation."
"9450536","ABSTRACT Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a complex disorder associated with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Unlike systemic hypertension, PH is difficult to detect in routine physical examinations and the current gold standard for diagnosing PH is through invasive right heart catheterization. Unlike in systemic hypertension, for which patients have effective pharmacological management of blood pressure for decades, PH prognosis remains poor with 15% mortality within 1 year on modern therapy. Challenges in early detection of PH, as well as structural differences in the cardio-pulmonary system (e.g., thinner ventricular wall, more distributed compliance and larger number of peripheral vessels) may explain the stark differences in clinical outcomes between systemic hypertension and PH. Our current understanding of PH has largely been obtained through animal models, clinical studies and computational modeling. However, surgical banding or chronic hypoxia animal models do not fully reproduce the etiology of human PH. Invasive clinical measurements of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), stiffness and ventricular elastance provide limited insight into disease progression. Computational models have been developed to study growth and remodeling (G&R) in the ventricles and hemodynamics in PH. However, these models are incomplete: ventricular G&R models lack coupling with evolving pulmonary hemodynamics, whereas pulmonary hemodynamic models have not included ventricular-arterial coupling. Given that the interactions between RV and the pulmonary vasculature are a key determinant of the clinical course of PH, specifically, the transition from compensated to decompensated remodeling, we submit that there is a pressing need to develop a multi-scale (MS) computational model that can couple the short term (e.g. hemodynamics) and long-term G&R interactions between the RV and the pulmonary circulation. In this project, we propose to develop a multi-scale, multi-physics computational model of the cardio-pulmonary circulation and calibrate it using longitudinal data acquired on cohorts of pediatric pulmonary hypertension and control (e.g., cardiac transplant) subjects. The model will be the first of its kind because it will be able to describe the bi-directional interactions between evolving ventricular and vascular biomechanics and hemodynamics using human pulmonary hypertension data."
"9551512","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of luteolin in preventing progression of prostate cancer and to uncover the molecular basis of its anticancer effects. Post-translational modification of histones is critical for regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex (PRC)-2, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing through its catalysis of the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27). EZH2- mediated epigenetic gene silencing plays an important role in prostate cancer initiation and progression. Increased EZH2 expression promotes neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells and cancer progression. Mechanistically, EZH2-mediated trimethylation of H3K27 results in silencing of a large number of tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A/p16, CDH1/E-cadherin, Disabled homolog 2-interacting protein (DAB2IP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-3 in prostate cancer. Functional assays have demonstrated EZH2 to be a bonafide oncogene. Our preliminary data suggest that: i) progressive increase in EZH2 during prostate cancer progression and its differential expression in cancer vs. corresponding normal/benign tissue, ii) from in silico studies, the plant flavone luteolin binds to the active site of EZH2, iii) interactin of luteolin with EZH2 and H3k27me3 proteins-ex vivo studies, iii) luteolin inhibits EZH2 expression and H3K27me3 in prostate cancer cells, iv) luteolin alters transcriptome and miRNA expression, v) luteolin decreases proliferation and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells, and vi) luteolin induces re-expression of tumor suppressor genes. Our working hypothesis is that luteolin-mediated suppression of EZH2 and its histone-lysine N- methyltransferase activity inhibits progression of prostate cancer not only through changes in histone methylation, but also through epigenetic modifications in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and post-translational changes in the levels of EZH2-regulatory miRNAs. We propose four complementary specific aims to determine: (1) the effects of luteolin on EZH2 and other PRC2 complex proteins, (2) the ability of luteolin to reverse EZH2-mediated epigenetic gene silencing, (3) the effects of luteolin on the regulation of specific miRNAs affecting EZH2-mediated changes in prostate cancer cells, and (4) the effects of luteolin-mediated EZH2 inhibition and associated molecular mechanisms on relevant in vivo situations using the TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model, which recapitulate human disease. Prostate cancer is highly prevalent and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the United States. The knowledge generated by completion of these studies has the potential to provide the VA healthcare system with unique opportunities for effective treatment strategies for VA men diagnosed with low- grade, low-volume prostate cancer. Such novel strategies are necessitated by the current realities that histologically identical cancers in different patients cn exhibit widely variant biologic behavior, and prostate cancer patients are more likely to have significant comorbidities than the general population. In conclusion, we will define the 1) role of EZH2-mediated epigenetic reprogramming in driving prostate cancer progression, as the EZH2-H3K27me3 epigenetic pathway appears to be very important for repression of tumor suppressor genes, and 2) the beneficial effects of luteolin, which will set a new paradigm in the management of prostate cancer patients undergoing active surveillance or at risk for biochemical recurrence."
"9543291","ABSTRACT: PROJECT 2 The proposed project describes a comprehensive research plan to develop and apply automated field- deployable lab-on-a-chip nanosensing platforms with high throughput, sensitivity and efficiency for multi- functional analysis of hazardous substances relevant to health and environmental monitoring in the Superfund Research Center (SRC). As extensive human activities pose increased environmental challenges worldwide, modern environmental monitoring and analytical technologies become particularly important to protect human health from adverse exposure to industrial pollutants, and to considerably improve public awareness. However, conventional laboratory-based analytical instruments are typically expensive and bulky, and require elaborate operational procedures conducted by dedicated personnel. The objective of this work is to deliver field- deployable multipurpose lab-on-a-chip technologies enabled by emerging microfluidics and nanosensing technologies for application in environmental monitoring and human health. Specifically, two innovative technological platforms to be investigated are: 1) a microfluidic print-to-analyze (MPA) system for high- throughput high-sensitivity biomolecular analysis (Aim I), and 2) a field-deployable ELISA-on-a-chip platform to incorporate quantitative nanosensing molecular assays (Aims II-IV), from which a 3D printable device can be customized and interfaced with mobile devices for health and environmental monitoring. Upon development, these technologies are expected to facilitate multiplexed, quantitative, automated processing and analysis of human biospecimens and environmental samples, with high sensitivity, quick turnover at low cost. Initial studies will involve testing these devices to detect pesticides and their degradation products, as an identified high concern for our community partner. More broadly, these platforms will be easily adaptable to commercial biorecognition molecules and detection of numerous Superfund priority chemicals. Overall, this research project directly advances the NIEHS mandate to develop analytical tools for the detection of hazardous chemicals and to apply them to environmental and human health monitoring applications."

"9457164","Project Summary/Abstract The overarching goal of our research is to understand the molecular basis of disease caused by enteric bacterial pathogens, and to leverage this knowledge to develop therapeutic agents that will benefit the Veteran population. A major focus of our laboratory is the study of the bacterial pathogen, Clostridium difficile, which causes healthcare-associated infections, and has been designated an ?Urgent Threat? by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The risk factors for acquiring C. difficile infection include age over 65 years, antibiotic treatment, and use of acid-suppressors; this combination of risk factors makes Veterans especially vulnerable to infection. Our ongoing epidemiological studies show that C. difficile infection rates in the Tucson VA (and other Arizona) hospitals are above the national average, and that many patients harbor `hyper-virulent' epidemic-associated strains of the pathogen. We have characterized VA C. difficile strains in detail, uncovered novel virulence strategies employed by these organisms, used cutting-edge genome analyses to track their evolution and spread, and provided feedback to physicians in an effort to reduce incidence of infections. We have also made several innovative advances in exploring the molecular mechanisms by which C. difficile causes disease. For these efforts, we have extensively used mass spectrometry techniques to globally analyze various strains to discern their unique virulence potential. Further, we have adopted, and greatly improved, recent methodologies to genetically manipulate C. difficile in order to understand its virulence; this has allowed us to knock out, or limit the expression of, various genes. Beyond the pioneering work revealing that C. difficile toxins contribute to disease, we have uncovered key roles for non-toxin factors including flagella, capsular polysaccharides and superoxide reductase in virulence. We have also used mass spectrometry to understand corresponding changes in host cells. Finally, building on our understanding of how C. difficile attaches to the host intestine, we recently designed and engineered a novel, safe ?synthetic biologic? agent to express C. difficile adhesins. In an animal model of infection, the agent was able to completely block C. difficile infection and disease. This product, the first generation of which is fully supported by our current VA Merit award, is now protected by a provisional patent, and is currently under intensive further refinement. It is anticipated that the agent will be an effective, safe, ?first-in-kind? non-antibiotic option to prevent C. difficile infection in Veterans, as well as all susceptible individuals."
"9451228","Project summary Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) are life-threatening pathologies characterized by progressive dilation associated with smooth muscle cell dysfunction and destructive extracellular matrix remodeling that ultimately lead to tear and rupture of the vessel wall. Current management of TAA relies on early detection by routine imaging and prophylactic repair by surgical procedures. The main goal of this proposal is to use systems therapeutics as an unbiased tissue-level strategy to identify combinatorial treatments with repurposed drugs that can efficaciously target TAA-related signaling pathways in mice with early onset, progressively severe Marfan syndrome (MFS). This genetic model of TAA was chosen because the mutated protein (fibrillin-1) regulates several key aspects of arterial function and homeostasis, including tissue integrity, endothelial cell mechanotransduction, and angiotensin II and TGF? signaling. Our proposal is organized into two specific aims that combine experimental and computational approaches to elucidate the pathogenic contributions of multiple signaling pathways and cell types in the fibrillin-1-deficient aortas of MFS mice (Aim 1); and predict and validate combinatorial drug treatments targeting disease-associated signals within and across distinct wall compartments (Aim 2). Our system therapeutics strategy is expected to transform MFS from a deadly arterial disease that requires surgical intervention to a chronic condition that can be managed medically."

"9551771","Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an incurable autoimmune biliary disease (?ABD?) in which the immune system destroys bile ducts by targeting cholangiocytes. Many immune based therapies have been applied to PBC, but none have been successful and the disease is currently incurable. Progress in finding new therapies for PBC has been blocked because the clinical symptoms of disease often arise many years after initiation of disease; thus data derived from human patients has not permitted fundamental insights into the immunopathogenesis of the disease. Fundamental new insights that can generate new therapeutic targets require information about the earliest pathogenesis of PBC, which must come from animal models of disease. We developed the first spontaneous animal model of PBC: NOD.ABD mice that develop autoimmune biliary disease remarkably similar to human including 1) anti-mitochondrial antibodies highly specific for human PBC; 2) disease transferable by autoreactive T cells; and 3) immunohistopathology highly characteristic of PBC with granuloma formation, T cell infiltrates in the biliary lining, and destructive cholangitis. Recently we discovered a novel genetic mutation in NOD ABD. Understanding how this novel genetic system controls the aberrant cholangiocyte: immune system interaction which drives ABD is the goal of the current grant. Here we have constructed a novel congenic mouse (NOD.Abd3) that allows us to mechanistically analyze the very earliest basis of disease. We also show that a genetic background which enhances autoimmunity (the NOD genetic background, which predisposes to many autoimmune conditions including T1D, Sjogren?s syndrome, and thyroiditis) must be present. This complex genetic etiology is similar to human disease. Therefore our unique model offers new insights into basic immunopathology relevant to human PBC and other cholangiopathies. We propose 3 aims: Aim 1: Determine the genetic basis of NOD autoimmune biliary disease. We show that disease in congenic NOD.Abd3 mice requires a region on chromosome 1, ?Abd3?, which includes a 1.0 Mb B6 interval (?B6-Abd3?) as well as mutated Pkhd1del36-67 upstream of it. Our hypothesis is that early expression of aberrant Pkhd1 in cholangiocytes breaks immune tolerance to cholangiocytes. We can prove/disprove this hypothesis by sophisticated genetic approaches. Aim 2: Determine the role of early cholangiocyte ?ductular reaction? in NOD.Abd3 pathogenesis. By 4 weeks of age, NOD.Abd3 bile ducts show massive immune infiltration which then ascends into intrahepatic bile ducts. Our hypothesis is that the aberrant immune response is due to an early ?ductular reaction? of NOD.Abd3 cholangiocytes, which stimulates the innate immune system. Aim 3: Mechanistic role of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and activated macrophages in NOD.Abd3 and human PBC pathogenesis. The immune system is required for clinical ABD in our model. We hypothesize that the Abd3 genetic region alters macrophage function/subset ratios. We will test the role of macrophages in both murine disease and human PBC liver samples. These studies are relevant to specific, incurable biliary diseases that affect Veterans, and are also important due to the central role hepatic immunity/inflammation plays in many liver diseases (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis, hepatitis C) that are common in Veteran populations. Our studies will produce insights into the basic biology of autoimmune cholangitis and liver inflammation/tolerance, and identify new therapeutic targets for these intractable conditions."
"9460511","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an Institutional Training Grant at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute (SKERI) to provide postdoctoral training in basic and clinical science relevant to translational vision research and rehabilitation. Thirteen faculty members whose expertise spans the areas of spatial and binocular vision, eye movements, strabismus, central vision loss, low vision and blindness rehabilitation, computer vision and assistive technology will train postdoctoral fellows seeking to specialize in translational vision research and rehabilitation. Research training goals will be accomplished through intensively supervised research projects, frequent and wide-ranging seminars, journal clubs and colloquia, as well as supervised research performance, proposal development and grant writing. Because the vast majority of SKERI Faculty are full-time researchers with no teaching duties and small laboratories, the Fellows experience a great deal of direct interaction with their sponsors. In addition, the Fellows have available to them many opportunities for interaction with the rest of the Faculty, which include basic, clinician and rehabilitation researchers. These interactions are facilitated by the group all being housed within the same building and all working in clinically relevant vision research. The Faculty-Fellow interactions represent all areas of the research process: proposal, critique, performance, and communication of findings through the writing of papers and preparation of presentations, as well as participation in scientific and ethics seminars. Importantly, Fellows are also in frequent contact with each other through organized events, adjacent open work-spaces, and the numerous collaborations among Faculty. The Fellowship program forms a critical component of the research vitality and capacity of SKERI. Because SKERI is not a degree-granting institution, its investigators do not typically have graduate students. It is widely appreciated within the Institute that Fellows bring in new ideas and techniques to the preceptors' laboratories. The process of training Fellows encourages Faculty to challenge old assumptions, to develop clear and concise descriptions of why a given research activity is of significance, and to expand the range of approaches to research problems. The T32 Program will significantly augment SKERI's internally funded Rachel C. Atkinson Fellowship, C.V. Starr Scholarship Program, and individual Fellowship awards from other sources to yield an overall program size of approximately 6-7 post-doctoral fellows."
"9558223","PROJECT SUMMARY GeoVax, a clinical-stage biotechnology company focusing on vaccine development against infectious diseases and cancer, seeks to build on its successful vaccine candidate against Lassa virus (LASV) to implement a novel immunogen design for eliciting broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. LASV is a member of the Arenaviridae family and is endemic in West Africa where it infects 100,000-300,000 persons each year, with approximately 5,000 deaths. No vaccine is currently under clinical development for the prevention of LASV infection. GeoVax created a vaccine against LASV (GEO-LM01) using its proven Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) Virus-Like Particle (VLP) platform. GEO-LM01 incorporates into the MVA genome LASV sequences encoding both a glycoprotein (GPC) and a matrix protein (Z). Upon infection of human cells, the MVA-driven expression of these proteins results in the budding from the surface of the infected cells of VLPs that bear natively-folded GPC on their surface. Pre-clinical testing of GEO-LM01 in a lethal mouse model demonstrated 100% protection after a single dose with strong T cell responses yet meagre antibody responses, in line with other vaccine candidates tested in animals. Capitalizing on recent breakthroughs in the structural characterization of LASV GPC, we propose in this Fast-Track Phase I/II application to develop and test novel GPC immunogen designs in the context of the MVA-VLP system. Phase I will consist of sequence design, MVA-VLP construction, in vitro testing, and efficacy and immunogenicity studies in an established lethal mouse model. In Phase II, GEO-LM01 and the selected new vaccine candidate will be produced at high titers and tested against all four major lineages of LASV in the established Hartley guinea pig challenge model. Both vaccines will then be tested for efficacy in non-human primates and will be concomitantly evaluated extensively for the magnitude and characteristics of the cellular and humoral immune responses. The final down-selected vaccine candidate will be tested for genetic stability and sterility in preparation for cGMP manufacturing and a Phase 1 clinical study."
"9462663","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a deadly vascular disease linked to an enigmatic repression of mitochondrial metabolism. Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are prosthetic groups that promote mitochondrial respiration and are regulated by the Fe-S assembly proteins ISCU and FXN (frataxin). Yet, the roles of Fe-S clusters in most human diseases including PH are unknown. We found that hypoxia-induced microRNA-210 represses ISCU, promoting Fe-S deficiency, pulmonary vascular metabolic dysregulation, and PH. We also found that FXN is down-regulated in PH and is controlled by the miR-130/301 family/PPAR? regulatory axis. We hypothesize that Fe-S deficiency, particularly in pulmonary vascular endothelium, is a critical pathogenic lynchpin of PH and is a common convergence point of genetic and acquired disease triggers. We plan to study both rodents and humans in vivo, delineating novel Fe-S-based origins of PH - namely, the coordinated microRNA-based regulation of ISCU/FXN by hypoxia and human genetic deficiencies of ISCU and FXN. Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether the miR-130/301 family represses FXN and Fe-S expression in order to control PH. In a hypoxic mouse model of PH and cultured pulmonary vascular endothelial cells from diseased mice coupled with novel biophysical assays to measure Fe-S levels, we will test the hypothesis that the miR-130/301 family down-regulates FXN in order to repress Fe-S biogenesis and mitochondrial respiration and thus promote PH. Such findings would identify miR-130/301-dependent control of FXN as a critical complement to the miR-210/ISCU axis in metabolic dysfunction and in the overall control of PH. 2) Determine whether up-regulation of miR-210 and miR-130/301 together promotes more robust down- regulation of Fe-S cluster expression and more severe PH manifestation than either miRNA alone. Using the model systems above, we will test the hypothesis that up-regulation of miR-210 and miR-130/301 together promote more robust down-regulation of Fe-S integrity and increased PH severity. Results would be invaluable for developing a roadmap for synergistic therapeutic targeting of microRNAs in PH. 3) Determine whether mutations of ISCU and FXN in humans directly promote PH. To assess for PH in human genetic deficiency of FXN or ISCU without hypoxia, we plan advanced cardiopulmonary exercise tests. We will also generate/study patient-specific inducible pluripotent stem cells to determine how the mutations control pulmonary vascular function. This rare combination of molecular study and patient testing should define PH risk in Fe-S deficiency, guiding clinical care and solidifying this paradigm's relevance in humans. Significance: This proposal incorporates rigorous expertise and new technological advancements in Fe-S biology coupled with a rare opportunity to translate mechanistic findings directly to humans. We aim to firmly establish Fe-S deficiency as a powerful and novel metabolic disease origin, a new therapeutic target for PH, and a foundation for discovery in other diseases that share similar hypoxic and metabolic underpinnings."
"9458094","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to understand how osteocytes, cells embedded in the bone matrix, control the process of bone resorption by osteoclasts under physiological and pathological conditions. Osteoclast formation, function, and survival depend on the cytokine receptor activator of NF?B ligand (RANKL), whose actions are inhibited by the soluble decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG). Recent studies have shown that osteocytes are an important source of the RANKL involved in osteoclast formation. The requirement of osteocyte RANKL for osteoclast formation raises the question of how this cytokine reaches osteoclast progenitors when produced by cells embedded in the bone matrix. RANKL is initially produced as an integral- membrane protein, which can then be cleaved by proteases to yield a soluble form, both of which are able to promote bone resorption. It remains unclear whether the osteoclast formation promoted by osteocyte-derived RANKL involves the membrane-bound form, the soluble form, or both. Cortical porosity is a type of bone loss that increases with aging and glucocorticoid excess, and some studies suggest that the former is associated with increased expression of RANKL in cortical bone. However, it is unknown whether osteocytes are the source of this RANKL and whether this increase is involved in the generation of cortical porosity associated with aging or glucocorticoid excess. Some studies suggest that OPG is also produced by osteocytes and those changes in OPG production may contribute to pathological bone resorption. However, OPG is produced by many cell types and it is unclear which cells provide the OPG important for control of bone remodeling. Based on these observations, we propose the central hypothesis that osteocytes control osteoclast formation via multiple mechanisms including production of soluble RANKL and OPG and this contributes to physiological as well as pathological bone resorption. To address this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will determine whether osteocytes control osteoclast formation via production of soluble or membrane-bound RANKL. Mice expressing a form of the RANKL protein that is resistant to proteolytic cleavage will be generated and their skeletons analyzed structurally and histologically under physiological and pathological conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine whether osteocyte-derived RANKL contributes to the cortical porosity caused by aging or glucocorticoid excess. Bone mass and structure, including cortical porosity, as well as osteoclast number, will be measured in 20-month-old mice lacking the RANKL gene in osteocytes and control littermates. The impact of glucocorticoid excess on cortical porosity will also be examined in adult mice of the same genotypes. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will determine whether osteocytes are an important source of OPG. A conditional allele of the OPG gene will be deleted from osteocytes using Dmp1-Cre and Sost-Cre transgenic mice and the skeletal phenotype compared to that of mice with germline deletion of OPG."
"9480805","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics (CGE) Program of Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University is a laboratory-based basic science program that seeks to better understand how altered genetic and epigenetic components of the genome contribute to the initiation and progression of human cancers. Under the leadership of Paula Vertino, PhD (leader) and Jin-Tang Dong, PhD (co-leader) the CGE Program includes 27 core members drawn from 14 departments and three schools across Emory University, including the School of Medicine, Emory College, and Rollins School of Public Health. The goals of the CGE program are to better understand the mechanisms that govern the maintenance of genome stability and proper gene regulatory networks, how these become corrupted in cancer cells, and how their disruption contributes to the initiation and progression of cancer. The CGE Program seeks to promote the expanded application of genomic technologies in the molecular classification of cancer phenotypes and outcomes. The scientific focus of the program is organized around three inter-related and complimentary themes: (1) DNA Damage, Repair, and Cellular Responses to Stress, (2) Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, and (3) Cancer Genetics and Genomics. Over the last competitive cycle CGE Program members have published 256 cancer-relevant scientific articles. Of these, 55 (21%) were intra- and 105 (41%) were inter-programmatic collaborations, and 123 (48%) represented a collaboration with another cancer center or other academic organization. As of March 31, 2016, CGE held $9.1 million in annual total cancer-relevant research funding, of which approximately $3 million (33%) was awarded from the NCI. Strong scientific synergism has led to important discoveries. Key insights into the mechanism of DNA double strand break repair, how replication stress is resolved, and radiation mutagenesis are leading to important predictors of chemotherapy and radiation response. Landmark investigations into the structure and function of the TET dioxygenase enzymes have revealed oxidized methylcytosine residues to be more than a transient intermediate in the turnover of 5mC, but a distinct component of the epigenetic `code' governing gene expression programs. Significant strides have been taken towards the successful translation of the program's genetics/genomics efforts, including new insight into the contribution of key `driver' gene mutations and the unique cellular vulnerabilities that such alterations unmask, an RNA-based biomarker panel for the early detection of aggressive prostate cancer, a combined RNA-DNA test for risk stratification in oropharyngeal carcinomas, and the implementation of a clinical genomics workflow to guide decision making in several cancer types. Overall, the CGE Program promotes center-wide goals for improvements in cancer outcomes across the state of Georgia by identifying of key points of cancer cell vulnerability that can be exploited towards new therapeutic opportunities and the development of genomic and epigenomic signatures as predictors of clinical outcomes and population risk."
"9462637","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators."
"9460507","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to investigate the pathophysiology of choroidal degeneration in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common form of untreatable central vision loss in the western world. The choroid, the complex vascular system supplying the outer retina, photoreceptors, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), can now be visualized in living humans using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (OCT). Recent studies of the choroid by clinicians using OCT, and by laboratory scientists using donor eyes, suggest the choroid is a critical tissue in the pathogenesis AMD, especially as it relates to degeneration of the RPE in geographic atrophy. Access to patients with AMD (from Iowa and from large, multicenter eye studies), a large human donor eye collection, extensive experience in histology, molecular biology, genetics, and image processing/analysis, and state-of-the-art genetics and molecular biology laboratories will provide us with a unique opportunity to uncover the critical role of the choroid in AMD. We will use human donor eyes to determine the biochemical pathways and anatomical differences occurring in eyes with AMD. This will allow us to explore the anatomic details of choroidal loss and determine the molecular basis of changes in thin choroids and eyes with AMD. We will also explore the consequences of choroidal loss on the retina in novel animal models. Finally, we will leverage our extensive experience in genetics to evaluate the extent to which genes already implicated in AMD also form the basis for choroidal degeneration using very large patient cohorts. This project also has the prospect of discovering new genes that impact structural features of the choroid and AMD biology. Our experiments will lead to a better understanding of this blinding disease and pave the way for treatments that can be utilized for patients with AMD."
"9556001","Project Summary To improve DNA sequencing by at least one order of magnitude and to develop practical methods of RNA se- quencing, this Phase I project focuses on using thin solid-state nanopore sensors on low-noise solid-state all- glass chips, operating at 10 MHz bandwidth for DNA sequencing and direct RNA sequencing. The basic concept involves using an applied voltage to drive single-stranded DNA molecules through a narrow nanopore, which separates chambers of electrolyte solution. This voltage also drives a flow of electrolyte ions through the pore, measured as an electric current. When molecules pass through the nanopore they modify the flow of ions, and structural information can be extracted by analysis of the duration and magnitude of the resulting current reduc- tions. Nanopore in 2D membranes improve the signal-to-noise ratio for molecular detection and analysis because the resistance to the ionic flow through a nanopore increases linearly with the nanopore thickness, so both the magnitudes of the ionic current and the blocked current with a translocating molecule increase with decreasing hanopore height. Specifically, we seek to make solid-state ionic-current based nanopore sequencing possible by combining three important components: two-dimensional solid-state nanopores fabricated with precise di- mensions that achieve signal-to-noise contrast that exceeds biological pores, optimized supporting all-glass chips, and optimally fast measurement of translocation through these pores with recently developed low-noise, high-bandwidth electronics. Our approach eliminates the need for any enzymes and enables DNA molecules to translocate freely through nanopores. Illustration 1: The Economist coverage from 2011 illustrating yet to be real- ized promises of nanopore-based DNA sequencing with two-dimensional na- nopores developed originally at the University of Pennsylvania and forming the scientific bases behind our SBIR R43 project on two-dimensional solid- state nanopores."
"9472405","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a group of heritable neuropsychiatric disorders whose symptoms, which include deficits in social interaction skills, impaired communication ability, and ritualistic-like repetitive behaviors, appear in early childhood and continue throughout life. In particular, repetitive, stereotyped and perseverative behaviors cause severe disruptions in the quality of life of ASD individuals and their families. Despite their clinical importance, the studies concerning these behaviors are relatively small in comparison with the investigations of other aspects of ASD symptomatology. Consequently, there is a significant need to understand the pathophysiology of these motor disturbances and the establishment of mechanism-based therapeutics to treat repetitive behaviors. The goal of this research proposal is to study how altered structural and synaptic plasticity in the striatum leads to repetitive, stereotyped and perseverative behaviors, and to identify new molecular targets to develop mechanism-based therapeutics to treat ASD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that exaggerated cap-dependent protein synthesis in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) causes altered plasticity resulting in repetitive, stereotyped, and perseverative behaviors. The novel eIF4E transgenic mouse (eIF4E Tg) model of ASD will be utilized to address three specific aims. Aim 1 will be performed during the mentored phase (K99) and is to determine whether eIF4E Tg mice display alterations in structural and synaptic plasticity in a specific subset of striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs). The remaining two aims will be initiated during the mentored phase (K99) and will be completed during the independent phase (R00). Aim 2 is to determine whether increased expression of eIF4E restricted to a specific subset of striatal MSNs is necessary and sufficient to generated ASD-like motor behavior. Aim 3 is to determine the identity of proteins whose synthesis is altered in a specific subset of striatal MSNs in the eIF4E transgenic mice. Lack of understanding of ASD pathogenesis hampers our search for new mechanism-based targets. This proposal will provide insight into how abnormal striatal synaptic physiology contributes to ASD etiology and molecular targets for the design of novel therapeutics for ASD."
"9462117","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application for funds to support pre- and postdoctoral training in visual neuroscience at New York University in the Center for Neural Science (CNS) and the Cognition and Perception Program in the Department of Psychology (CP). We seek to renew training support for 6 pre-doctoral and 2 postdoctoral fellows. This level of support is justified by the need for the training program to provide for the training of a diverse yet coherent group of trainees. With the help of previous NEI support, the Visual Neuroscience Training Program has become a leading center for research training and has launched and shaped the careers of many who have made important contributions to the field. The 17 faculty of the training program seek to understand the visual system from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, but all share a consistent focus on understanding visual function. The quality, experience, breadth, and productivity of the training faculty have in the past and wil in the future provide a fertile intellectual environment in which young scientists can thrive. Thre newly recruited faculties have invigorated the program and made it even better. There is ample instruction through courses and especially through mentoring in the research labs of CNS and CP that helps bring trainees to the frontiers of vision research. Many active researchers supported by NEI and other agencies provide direction, leadership, and support for students once they emerge as more independent senior scholars. Extensive shared facilities, including MRI scanners, an MEG and a TMS facility operated solely for research the two participating departments; facilitate collaborations among faculty and trainees. The students who join the CNS and CP doctoral programs are of outstanding quality and a very high proportion have historically gone on to successful and in some cases stellar careers in visual neuroscience."
"9509323","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project summary: Substance abuse and sleep disorders are both common problems in the United States and around the world. In the US alone, over 20 million people suffer from substance abuse and/or sleep disorders. Similar to the general US population, sleep disorders and substance use are common in veterans (Newsletter of the National Office of Drug Control Policy, 2010), with populations such as those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibiting especially high rates. Furthermore, sleep disorders/difficulties are often co-morbid with substance abuse (Shibley et al., 2008; Gromov and Gromov, 2009). Sleep disturbances have been demonstrated during active drug use, during withdrawal, and during abstinence periods (Morgan et al., 2006; Morgan et al., 2008). There is abundant evidence that sleep disruption in humans is a robust predictor of relapse (Brower et al., 2001) and difficulty sleeping is often cited as a reason for substance use (Brower et al., 2001). However, there have been few attempts to directly assess whether sleep loss has a causal role in future drug use. One basic, and as of yet unanswered, question is whether sleep loss augments the appetitive value a drug. In the current proposal, the hypothesis that sleep deprivation enhances the rewarding properties of cocaine will be tested using the conditioned place preference (CPP) task. The CPP task assesses cue-induced drug seeking following conditioning trials to a presumed appetitive (cocaine) and a presumed neutral (saline) stimulus. Mice will undergo short periods of sleep deprivation either prior to cocaine conditioning trials or prior to the probe trial to test whether sleep deprivation alters cocaine conditioned place preference acquisition or expression, respectively. Preliminary evidence suggests that sleep deprivation does increase preference for the cocaine-paired context. Finally, two neuromodulator systems, adenosine and orexin, will be probed as possible mechanisms by which sleep, or loss thereof, could impact reward behavior. These two systems have previously been implicated in both sleep/waking activity and addiction. Behavioral, genetic, and pharmacological techniques will be used to carry out the proposed experiments. The project mentors provide expertise in all the fields relevant to the research project, including sleep/waking behavior (Greene, Yanagisawa), addiction research (Self), and the adenosine (Greene) and orexin (Yanagisawa) systems."

If the intervention is successful, the CBT-OSA treatment may be disseminated to providers within VHA through VA's Evidence-Based Practices (EBP) national roll-out program."
"9462218","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research is to identify targets for new interventions to reduce the doubled cardiac event recurrence and mortality risk faced by the 1 in 8 survivors of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (UA) who develop PTSD secondary to their life-threatening cardiac event. Research on the mechanisms likely to carry that risk is converging on autonomic dysregulation as the culprit. PTSD is associated with high heart rate (HR) and low heart rate variability (HRV), both established secondary risk markers in NSTEMI/UA patients. In our recently offered Enduring Somatic Threat (EST) model, we propose a vicious cycle in which PTSD intrusion symptoms cause acute autonomic imbalance, leading to heart rhythm alterations that are perceived as threatening by the patient, causing further autonomic imbalance. Further, the model proposes that this vicious cycle is exacerbated by non-adherence to beta-blockers (medications that blunt sympathetic influences on HR), a common avoidance behavior in patients with PTSD. Surprisingly, although autonomic imbalance is the leading candidate for PTSD's influence on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in populations from young veterans to older adults with cardiovascular disease, its candidacy is based almost solely on research conducted in the clinic or the laboratory. No study has ever tested the association of PTSD symptoms and cardiovascular parameters in the real world. We propose to test the EST model in our Reactions to Acute Care and Hospitalization observational cohort study of 1,741 NSTEMI/UA patients. We will enroll 100 participants with NSTEMI/UA-induced PTSD, and 100 without, at 1-month after hospital discharge. For 1 week, participants will (1) report on PTSD intrusion symptoms in the 30 minutes prior to each of 10 daily electronic momentary assessments (EMA); (2) wear an ambulatory smart shirt embedded with ECG and an accelerometer, from which we will derive heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV); and (3) have their adherence to beta blockers electronically monitored. We will test whether NSTEMI/UA patients with PTSD have higher 24-hr HR and lower 24-hr HRV than those without PTSD and, if so, whether the frequency and intensity of intrusive thought(s) explains the difference. Further, we will test whether HR is higher, and HRV lower, for epochs in which patients report intrusions relative to those in which they do not and whether the difference is more pronounced in patients with PTSD. Finally, we will test whether patients with PTSD are less adherent to beta-blockers, and explore whether associations of intrusions with HR/HRV are more pronounced on days that patients miss their dose. More than 150,000 Americans develop PTSD secondary to NSTEMI/UA each year, and they are at high risk for adverse outcomes. This research will determine whether autonomic dysregulation in the real world is truly a candidate mechanism, describe the dynamics by which PTSD causes it, identify the factors most important to target and the point in the vicious cycle to intervene, and suggest new interventions to offset risk."

"9470863","Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions."
"9437820","Despite marked declines, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. To further decrease CHD, a better understanding of CHD risks and outcomes in the 21st century is needed in light of: 1) continued health disparities; 2) declining ST elevation myocardial infarctions (MI); 3) increasing sensitivity of troponin laboratory assays, increasing detection of very small and previously undetectable MI events; 4) wide use of statins and revascularization procedures, complicating population studies and risk prediction; 5) more people surviving their first MI; 6) increased emphasis on population health management and patient-centeredness. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort includes 30,239 community-dwelling white and black participants recruited in 2003-2007. In the previous 2 funding cycles, the REGARDS-MI ancillary study has produced >100 publications on racial disparities in CHD and identified novel CHD risk factors. The REGARDS parent and other ancillary studies have collected extensive phenotype, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor, and patient-reported outcomes data, including linked Medicare data. A second in-home visit is nearing completion, providing patient-centered endpoints including quality of life up to 10 years following first MI. The availability of these novel data coupled with >10 years of follow-up for all participants offers a unique opportunity to study CHD among high-risk subpopulations, e.g., those with low socioeconomic status (SES), blacks, and older adults to identify strategies to optimize population health while simultaneously eliminating health disparities. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine the 10-year incidence of CHD and CVD (either CHD or stroke) and examine associations with traditional and emerging risk factors. CHD events will be adjudicated using the same rigorous methods used during the first 2 funding periods and combined with stroke events adjudicated through the parent REGARDS study. We will refine published CHD and CVD risk prediction models and assess emerging risk factors in subgroups (e.g., age, race, sex, and SES) and by MI type (very small or `microsize' MI, and type 2 MI). 2) Develop pragmatic strategies to identify high-risk subgroups that could be targeted for interventions to optimize population health while simultaneously eliminating health disparities. We will calculate population attributable risks and numbers of events potentially averted through population shifts in risk factor distributions. 3) Determine the rates of, and risk factors for, recurrent CHD events, heart failure (HF), and mortality after first adjudicated MI (including very small, or `microsize' MI, and type 2 MI) or coronary revascularization procedure, overall, and in subgroups (e.g., type of CHD event, age, race, sex, and SES). 4) Using data from the 2nd in- home visit, describe patient-centered outcomes (functional status, depressive symptoms, stress, cognitive functioning, quality of life), HF, secondary prevention, and risk factor management up to 10 years after first adjudicated MI , overall and in subgroups (e.g., age, race, sex, and SES)."
"9461945","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          We reported that dietary cholesterol induces progression from simple steatosis to NASH. We subsequently discovered that cholesterol crystals were present within the lipid droplets of steatotic hepatocytes in both patients with NASH and in mouse models of NASH induced by high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet, but not in patients or mice with simple steatosis. We described that Kupffer cells (KCs) selectively surrounded and processed steatotic hepatocytes containing cholesterol crystals forming characteristic crown-like structures (CLS). Thus, both hepatocytes and KCs become exposed to cholesterol crystals, which have recently been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in animal models of atherosclerosis. We demonstrated NLRP3 activation in the KCs that form CLSs thus providing a mechanism by which exposure of hepatocytes and KCs to cholesterol crystals can lead to the chronic sterile inflammation of NASH. Collectively these results support our novel hypothesis that hepatic cholesterol crystallization causes NASH via activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. We will pursue this hypothesis in both mouse models and humans with the following specific aims:  SA1. Determine whether development of hepatocyte cholesterol crystals and KC-CLSs is the  trigger that induces NLRP3 activation and progression from simple steatosis to NASH. a. In vitro experiments: HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells will be induced to develop large LDs either with or without cholesterol crystals and then co-cultured with THP1 macrophages or primary mouse KCs in contact or non- contact cocultures. We hypothesize that THP1 cells or KCs will demonstrate uptake of cholesterol crystals and NLRP3 activation only when co-cultured with HepG2 cells that have cholesterol crystals within their LDs. We will delineate the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol crystals activate NLRP3 and induce IL-1?. b. In vivo experiments: Wild-type (Wt) C57BL/6J mice and hypercholesterolemic mice (Ldlr (-/-) and APOE2ki) will be exposed to high-fat diets ranging in cholesterol concentration from 0% to 1%. We hypothesize that all three mouse models will develop NLRP3 activation and histological NASH at that particular threshold dietary cholesterol concentration that leads to hepatic cholesterol crystals and CLSs in each mouse model, irrespective of other cholesterol-related factors. This will demonstrate that cholesterol crystallization is the critical switch that initiats NASH via NLRP3 activation.  SA2. Determine whether genetic inactivation (global, KC-specific, or hepatocyte-specific) or  pharmacological inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome prevent the development of cholesterol  crystal-induced NASH. We will use global Casp1(-/-) and Nlrp3(-/-) KO mice to demonstrate that inactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibits cholesterol crystal-induced NASH. We will compare conditional KOs in which the Nlrp3 gene is selectively deleted either in KCs (Nlrp3KC(-/-)) or hepatocytes (Nlrp3Hep(-/-)) to distinguish whether NLRP3 activation in hepatocytes (causing pyroptosis) or KCs (causing release of cytokines, chemokines and inflammatory recruitment) or both is contributing to cholesterol crystal-induced NASH. We will determine whether a novel, oral, pharmacological NLRP3 inhibitor can prevent or reverse cholesterol crystal-induced NASH in Wt mice on a HFHC diet, with potential therapeutic implications for human NASH.  SA3. Determine the prevalence and risk factors of hepatic cholesterol crystallization in human  NAFLD/NASH and evaluate whether hepatic cholesterol crystallization independently predicts  NLRP3 activation and development of NASH vs simple steatosis. We will use data and stored frozen liver tissue specimens from an existing VA biorepository of well- characterized patients with NAFLD/NASH (n=166)."
"9472243","CORE D - ABSTRACT The UCSF ADRC Neuropathology, Biospecimens, and Genetics core (NP core, Core D) provides vital research support to the UCSF ADRC and to the neurodegenerative disease research community at UCSF and beyond. Neurodegenerative disease pathology and genetics have become increasingly exciting and complex in recent years, with major advances arising from work accomplished through this ADRC. In this renewal application, the NP Core will continue to be led by Dr. William Seeley. Dr. Lea Grinberg will found a new Biospecimens sub-core, and Drs. Dan Geschwind and Giovanni Coppola will continue to lead the Genetics sub-core at UCLA. The NP Core aims to: (1) Obtain and bank human biomaterial for neuropathological, biochemical, and genetic charaterization; (2) Analyze specimens and document results, including NP diagnoses rendered using current diagnostic consensus criteria, and (3) Enter NP, bioassay, and genetics results into research-oriented databases and distribute specimens. These core functions will support the aims of Projects 1 (EOAD variants), 2 (PPA heterogeneity), and 3 (iPSC models) by providing final neuropathological diagnoses, organizing and conducting biochemical analyses, and providing genotyping and gene expression analysis. Moreover, the NP Core will help to further develop a unique bank of specially handled materials (brain, spinal cord, CSF, plasma, urine, RNA/DNA) for ongoing and future molecular, translational, clinicopathological, and biomarker discovery research."
"9472385","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): COPD is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability in the US. Despite the growing availability of efficacious pharmacotherapy for COPD, patients still experience a significant disease burden and with more than half reporting significant impairment in functioning. Thus the efficacy of COPD medications in clinical trials stands in stark contrast to the poor outcomes experienced by patients in the real world. One possible explanation for this gap is low rates of medication adherence. Only 25% of COPD patients are adherent, which is the lower than other chronic illnesses including diabetes, hypertension and congestive heart failure. Despite the high prevalence of nonadherence in COPD interventions there are significant gaps in the development and evaluation of interventions for adherence. Previous research has been based on cross sectional studies using self-reported measures of adherence and largely a theoretical. In the absence of data, many hospital systems are developing interventions to address medication adherence as part of their clinical program to reduce hospital readmissions and avoid financial penalties from CMS. This project proposes to recruit 360 patients with COPD to longitudinally evaluate potential determinants on adherence and disease progression based on theory of self-regulation. Participants will use novel electronic medication monitors to measure adherence to long term controller and rescue medications and ecological momentary assessments to measure patient reported respiratory symptoms and patients reactions including outcome expectancies, self-efficacy to management symptoms and medication health beliefs. This data will be used to evaluate the theory of self-regulation in COPD. Participants will also complete bi-annual clinical visits to track disease progression on clinical outcomes (e.g., lung function, functional status, quality of life) and psychological/ cognitive functioning. The impact f this study is to identify novel and potentially powerful targets for behavioral interventions in COPD which has been understudied despite its tremendous detrimental impact on overall public health."
"9457428","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a resubmission of a competing renewal application for an ongoing collaborative program among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New England Eye Center and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Eye Center. This is a multidisciplinary program which integrates imaging technology research, clinical and small animal imaging studies. The specific aims are:  Aim 1. Next generation OCT technology and methods for structural and functional imaging. We propose to develop ultrahigh speed swept source OCT (SSOCT) at 1050nm which will enable wide field volumetric retinal and choroidal structural imaging, OCT angiography of retinal and choroidal microvasculature as well as Doppler OCT to measure total retinal blood flow and functional stimulus response. In parallel, we will continue development of ultrahigh resolution (UHR) spectral domain OCT (SDOCT) with 2-3?m axial resolution to visualize and measure outer retinal structures. We will also develop 3D image processing techniques to correct motion artifacts, enable volumetric data averaging and quantitatively analyze 3D data. Volumetric data from different patient visits will be registered to track disease progression and measure subtle changes in pathology.  Aim 2. Structural and functional imaging of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma. Cross sectional and longitudinal structural and functional clinical imaging studies will be performed in patients with AMD, DR and glaucoma. Changes in photoreceptors, RPE and Bruch's membrane are possible markers of disease in AMD and will be investigated using UHR SDOCT. Volumetric structural imaging of the retina and choroid will be performed using ultrahigh speed SSOCT. 3D vascular and capillary structure in the retina, ONH, choriocapillaris and choroid, potential markers of AMD, DR, and glaucoma will be investigated using OCT angiography. Alterations in blood flow and functional flicker stimulus response (neurovascular coupling) will be investigated in DR and glaucoma patients using Doppler OCT and OCT angiography. Studies will include patients with different levels of disease as well as normal controls. The objective is to identify new structural and functional markers for early diagnosis, monitoring progression and response to therapy.  Aim 3. New OCT techniques for structural and functional imaging in small animals. We propose to develop ultrahigh speed OCT methods for structural and functional hemodynamic imaging in small animals. Studies will investigate the streptozotocin-induced rat diabetes model compared to normal controls. We will also develop spectroscopic OCT techniques to measure retinal vascular permeability with Evans blue dye exogenous contrast. Spectroscopic OCT will provide 3D maps of retinal vascular permeability and will be more efficient than current ex vivo Evans blue vascular permeability assays. Advances in small animal imaging will be powerful tools for both fundamental studies of disease mechanisms and pharmaceutical development."
"9460504","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that increased lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression and activation triggered by high glucose/diabetes compromises basement membrane (BM) function and thereby induces excess permeability and vascular cell death in diabetic retinopathy (DR). The hypothesis is based on findings that diabetes increases expression of LOX, which is required for the formation and maturation of the BM, and that HG-induced LOX upregulation and over-activation compromises endothelial barrier function. Importantly, inhibition of HG-induced LOX overexpression results in reduced cell monolayer permeability. While LOX is known for its cross-linking activity, LOX propeptide (LOX-PP), released during LOX biogenesis, is known for regulating cell proliferation and survival through modulation of Akt and Erk pathways. Our preliminary data indicates that HG-induced LOX overexpression promotes apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells, and that the process may be exacerbated by LOX-PP, which is upregulated by HG. Furthermore, preliminary data indicates that LOX binds with high affinity to extracellular fibronectin (FN) under HG condition, and interferes with LOX internalization into the cell, a process unique to LOX. Thus, the rationale for the proposed studies is that (i) HG-induced LOX overexpression contributes to capillary leakage, and together with increased LOX-PP promotes apoptosis by modulating Akt and Erk pathways, and (ii) HG-induced increased binding of LOX with ECM proteins, decreases LOX internalization, attenuates negative feedback signaling and thereby promotes LOX overexpression. The proposed studies will be performed using biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches utilizing cell culture models, diabetic rats, and LOX heterozygous KO mice (LOX+/-). Towards this goal, we have generated LOX+/- mice colonies at our animal facility that are now available for the proposed studies. The specific aims of this proposal are to determine (i) whether inhibition of LOX overexpression and activation prevents apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells in vitro, and reduces vascular cell loss and permeability in diabetic rat retinas (ii) whether the decreased LOX level in LOX+/- mice is protective against diabetes-induced retinal vascular lesions, and (iii) mechanism(s) by which HG induces LOX overexpression and promotes retinal vascular cell loss. Findings from these studies are expected to identify a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing retinal vascular cell loss and capillary leakage, and provide mechanistic insights underlying HG-induced LOX overexpression in DR."
"9472819","PROJECT SUMMARY  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are prevalent, costly to society, and frequently co-occur. In fact, nearly half of individuals in treatment for AUD meet diagnostic criteria for current PTSD. Both AUD and PTSD are moderately heritable and have overlapping latent genetic risk; however, etiological models examining the shared risk between these phenotypes are lacking. The drinking to cope self- medication model is a promising paradigm to inform research in this area. Although it is well accepted that coping-oriented drinking is linked with problematic alcohol use and increased likelihood of AUD, there is a paucity of research examining drinking to cope with trauma-related symptoms specifically. To date, there are no studies, phenotypic or genetic, on trauma-related drinking to cope. The present study seeks to fill this void by leveraging a genetically informative longitudinal cohort study from a large urban university (NIAAA-R37 AA011408) in order to achieve three primary aims: 1) examine the relationships between AUD symptoms, trauma-related drinking to cope, and PTSD symptoms and determine if trauma-related drinking to cope mediates the relationship between PTSD and AUD symptoms; 2) examine genetic variation (i.e., genome wide association [GWA] analyses) and aggregate risk (i.e., genome wide complex trait analyses [GCTA], polygenic risk score [PRS]) associated with trauma-related drinking, PTSD, and shared variation between the two phenotypes; and 3) apply bioinformatics tools to investigate genetic pathways associated with, and probable overlap between, trauma-related drinking and PTSD. The results of this study will aid in elucidating shared genetic influences underlying trauma-related drinking and PTSD, an area which remains poorly understood. The ability to identify individuals with higher biological risk for trauma-related drinking and PTSD will inform targeted prevention and integrative intervention strategies, particularly among individuals at increased psychosocial risk for problematic alcohol use and PTSD, such as college-age populations.  The proposed NRSA study has been developed with four specific training goals in mind: 1) develop expertise in the empirical study of trauma-related phenotypes (e.g., AUD, trauma-related drinking, PTSD); 2) gain a solid foundation in molecular and statistical genetics; 3) gain knowledge and experience in bioinformatics techniques, such as genetic pathway analyses; and 4) further cultivate professional development skills that will enhance the candidate?s background in support of becoming a knowledgeable and well-rounded academic researcher. These research and training aims reflect the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism?s (NIAAA) mission, which emphasizes clinically relevant, transdisciplinary research, as well as directly align with the NIAAA Strategic Objective to ?identify genes associated with vulnerability for alcohol dependence by employing new and emerging technologies, particularly on samples from study populations previously recruited for genetic research on alcohol dependence.? !"
"9461486","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major goal of this application is to understand the interplay between receptors and channels that control excitability of the thin fiber muscle afferents that evoke the exercise pressor reflex (EPR) as well as transduce the sensation of pain. The EPR, which arises from contraction of skeletal muscle, is one of two key neural mechanisms that evoke the cardiovascular adjustments to exercise. These adjustments, which support the ability of skeletal muscles to contract by increasing blood flow and oxygen to exercising muscles, include increases in systemic blood pressure, cardiac output and ventilation. With respect to the thin fiber muscle afferents that mediate the EPR, we combine the power of the in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp technique to determine the mechanisms of afferent excitability, with the physiological insights provided by in vivo electrophysiology to determine how these mechanisms translate into increased excitability. For in vitro experiments, muscle afferents will be identified by retrograde labeling DRG neurons with DiI that has been injected into the triceps surae muscles. Particular attention will be paid to small afferent neurons that express channels known to elicit the EPR (e.g. ASIC, TRPV1, P2X and TRPA1). For in vivo experiments, thin fiber triceps surae muscle afferents will be identified by their conduction velocities and their receptive fields. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, we will concentrat on the mechanisms by which two receptors, the  opioid (Aim 1) and ?-opioid (Aim 2) receptors, inhibit the EPR. Additional experiments will investigate the role of two voltage depend ion channels, KV7 (Aim 3) and NaV1.7 (Aim 4) in controlling the excitability of the EPR. The proposed experiments are natural extensions from those of our previous funding period and will greatly increase our understanding of the mechanisms affecting the excitatory afferents comprising the sensory arm of the EPR."
"9668255","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): No virus encodes a ribosome. Thus all viruses require the host translation machinery for the synthesis of viral proteins. This fundamental host:pathogen interface creates two critical barriers to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) mRNA translation. The first is competition for limiting components of the translation machinery. The second is the inactivation of critical translation factors by host antiviral defenses. How HCMV avoids competition and blunts antiviral defenses to ensure efficient viral protein synthesis is poorly understood, highlighting a critical gap in our knowledge of the mechanisms controlling HCMV mRNA translation. Many viruses prevent competition for the translation machinery by inhibiting host translation, however host translation is maintained during HCMV infection. How then do HCMV mRNAs effectively compete with host mRNAs for access to ribosomes? Formation of the eIF4F translation initiation complex is the limiting step in host mRNA translation due to the low abundance of eIF4F subunits. Thus competition between host and viral mRNAs would be most intense for recruiting eIF4F. Our data suggests that HCMV avoids competition for eIF4F by using an unknown complement of alternative initiation factors. We find that the eIF4F complex is necessary for the ongoing translation of host mRNAs during infection. However HCMV mRNAs translate efficiently when the eIF4F complex is disrupted. In Aim1 we define the factors necessary for the eIF4F-independent translation of the IE1 and IE2 mRNAs, two critical regulators of the HCMV lytic cycle, and then determine how these factors contribute to the widespread eIF4F-independent translation of HCMV mRNAs as a whole. The second barrier to HCMV mRNA translation is the inactivation of critical translation factors by host antiviral defenses. Our lab and others have shown that the HCMV TRS1 protein (pTRS1) inhibits the antiviral kinase PKR. Activated PKR inhibits the eIF2 translation factor by phosphorylating the eIF2? subunit. However phosphorylated eIF2? accumulates in infected cells treated with a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, even as PKR remains inactive. This suggests that HCMV has an unknown additional mechanism to ensure eIF2 remains active during infection. Analysis of pTRS1 binding partners revealed that pTRS1 binds the protein phosphatase PP1, which dephosphorylates eIF2?, independent of its ability to bind PKR. Further, pTRS1 binds the host DHX29 RNA helicase, which can promote translation independent of the eIF4F complex. In Aim 2 we determine how HCMV pTRS1 increases translation independent of PKR inhibition by 1) binding to PP1 to limit eIF2? phosphorylation and 2) promoting translation of HCMV mRNAs through its interaction with DHX29. Together these aims will determine how HCMV overcomes these two critical barriers to viral mRNA translation, and identify regulatory events unique to HCMV mRNA translation that could be targeted to limit HCMV disease."

"9457152","Abstract  There remains no effective treatment to reverse aging-related dementia disorders (ARDD), including Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Epidemiologic, preclinical and clinical data show that vascular disease is strongly associated with ARDD and AD and that vascular dysfunction leading to cerebral hypoperfusion is critical in the early stages of AD. Prior investigators showed that medin, a 50 amino acid peptide found in vascular smooth muscle layer, is the most common amyloid protein in humans with progressive vascular deposition with aging. Medin was implicated as a cause of vessel wall degenerative changes associated with vascular aging, but its role in aging-related cerebrovascular dysfunction is not known. We have preliminary data in both adipose and leptomeningeal arterioles that medin as well as ?-amyloid (A?), a peptide involved in AD, induce endothelial dysfunction through oxidative stress and reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and that medin induces strong pro- inflammatory response in endothelial cells. Our overall goal is to test the hypotheses that medin amyloid protein, alone or synergistically with A?, is a significant, but unrecognized, cause of ARDD by inducing human brain microvascular dysfunction and inflammation. For Aim 1 we will probe the role of medin amyloid and its interaction with A? in causing aging-associated human cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive dysfunction. We will measure extent of cerebrovascular medin amyloidosis in the elderly and its relationship to cognitive dysfunction and Alzheimer?s disease using tissue and associated pre-mortem clinical data from Sun Health Research Institute Brain Donation Program. We will also probe mechanisms by which medin amyloid induces cerebrovascular dysfunction in ex-vivo rapid autopsy human brain leptomeningeal arterioles, focusing on the role of nitric oxide dysregulation, oxidative stress and induction of vascular inflammation. We will study the interaction between medin and A? in inducing human cerebrovascular dysfunction, vascular inflammation and cognitive dysfunction. For Aim 2, we will validate whether peripherally obtained subcutaneous adipose arterioles are useful surrogates to brain cerebrovascular arterioles in studying medin and A?-induced microvascular dysfunction. The proposal will have impact in the potential discovery of a novel mechanism that could link vascular aging and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly. Furthermore, the use of a novel and unique human brain tissue model would enhance the translation relevance of the findings to the human condition."
"9457444","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The photoreceptor outer segment is the site of phototransduction. The phototransductive disk membranes of each outer segment are continually renewed, resulting in a large amount of membrane trafficking from the photoreceptor inner segment to the photoreceptor outer segment, and, eventually, to the retinal pigmented epithelial cells. The formation of outer segment disk membranes is a major process of membrane remodeling, and the renewal is central to photoreceptor cell biology and disease. Competing hypotheses, resulting from differing EM observations, have been presented in the literature to account for how these disk membranes are formed. It has been argued that the different results are due to different methods of tissue fixation. However, in addition to differen methods of tissue preservation, the different studies have focused on different species, and, moreover, time of day has not been considered (yet, there is evidence of a daily cycle in disk membrane growth). The proposed research will advance our knowledge of the organization of nascent rod outer segment disks, and thus mechanisms of disk morphogenesis, by addressing the gaps in published work, and by applying novel technologies to this problem. We will study mouse and monkey retinas. With mouse, we will take the method of preservation of the basal disk membranes to a higher level by using high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution, and thus obviate potential artifacts introduced by chemical primary fixation. Further, we will perform EM serial tomography of the basal rod disks in mouse and monkey, in order to obtain nano-scale, 3D resolution of their organization. The superior resolution afforded by this method, together with the 3D imagery, will enable a complete analysis of membrane connections and continuities that has been unavailable by the methods used to date. This novel approach, will allow us to focus on defining the fundamentally important organization of newly formed basal disks in rod outer segments. Following the studies on WT mouse, we will perform comparable analyses, using three lines of mutant mice that possess defective disk morphogenesis. EM tomographic analyses of the aberrant disks in these mice will provide insight into the normal process, as well as increase our understanding of mechanisms underlying the forms of retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy, and macular degeneration that these mice model. Overall, this proposal will apply state-of-the-art EM technology and 3D image analyses that will provide a major advance in one of the most essential cell biological problems in photoreceptor biology and disease."
"9459366","Abstract In the clinical diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR), fluorescein angiography (FA) is currently the only method used routinely for the detection and treatment of ischemia, but it is an invasive method and not sensitive to early microvascular changes before the onset of visual symptoms. For the early detection and management of ischemia in DR, Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a novel method that has obtained FDA approval in 2015. Compared with FA, OCTA allows non-invasive imaging of both the neurosensory retina as well as the retinal vasculature at ~10?m resolution. Some recent studies have successfully used OCTA to extract quantitative 2D metrics that are well correlated with DR severity. Dr. Kashani?s group has pioneered several of the 2D OCTA metrics for the quantitative assessment of capillary morphology and density. While highly valuable, these 2D OCTA metrics were derived from the en face projection of the 3D OCTA data, and therefore inevitably obscure the geometric and topological information in the original 3D vasculature networks. To overcome this fundamental limitation, Drs. Shi and Kashani will collaborate in this R21 project to develop truly 3D metrics for the automated analysis of OCTA data and apply them for the early diagnosis of DR in large scale eye studies. For brain mapping research, Dr. Shi?s group at Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) of USC has developed various advanced computational tools for 3D shape analysis based on generally applicable principles from intrinsic geometry. In this project, we will translate and adapt these tools for 3D retinal vasculature modeling and analysis using OCTA data. There are three specific aims in this project: (1) Apply cutting-edge computational algorithms developed in brain imaging to develop novel 3D OCTA metrics for volume- and surface-based quantitation of retinal capillary density and morphology. (2) Define the relationship and reliability of 2D- and 3D-OCTA metrics with clinical severity of DR using our previously published cohorts of healthy and diabetic subjects. (3) Validate the relationship of 2D- and 3D-OCTA metrics with DR severity among a well-characterized population from the NEI funded African American Eye Diseases Study (AFEDS) and identify OCTA metrics associated with currently undetectable (sub-clinical) retinopathy. Given the rich computational tools developed by Dr. Shi?s group at LONI and the already collected, large-scale OCTA data (n=396) from the AFEDS study and Dr. Kashani?s published studies, the risk of this project is low, but the resulting 3D OCTA metrics and associated software tools will be highly valuable to the research and potentially clinical community. We will make all the software tools and source codes developed in this project freely available through the NITRC (http://www.nitrc.org) and LONI website (http://www.loni.usc.edu/Software)."
"9480602","Project Summary The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD), one of the most common disorders in the United States, is doubled in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Traditionally thought of as two interacting, though fundamentally independent disorders, emerging evidence suggests that MDD and T2DM may share a common etiology: dysregulated metabolism. Dysregulated metabolism could disrupt neuronal activity in key limbic areas, contributing to MDD. However, little is known about how metabolic processes affect neuronal activity in key limbic areas such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in control states, or how these processes become dysregulated under metabolically stressful conditions. The central hypothesis of this study is that AMPK plays an important regulatory role in BLA excitability and affective behavior that becomes dysregulated under metabolically stressful conditions. This project will first elucidate how AMPK activity regulates affective behavior in rats. Using site-specific injection of an AMPK inactivator into the BLA, affective behavior will be tested using the elevated plus maze and forced swim task paradigms. Motor and cognitive behavior will also be tested using the open field maze and novel object recognition task. In addition to pharmacological AMPK inactivation, AAV viruses will be injected into the BLA to express a dominant-negative form of the AMPK ?2 subunit specifically in BLA principal neurons, testing the effect of cell-type specific AMPK inactivation on affective behavior. Secondly, this project will characterize how AMPK activity modulates BLA principal neuron excitability. Using whole-cell patch clamp slice electrophysiology, the effect of intra- and extracellular administration of an AMPK inactivator on membrane resistance, spike threshold, and LTP threshold of BLA principal neurons will be tested. The effects of dominant negative AMPK ?2 subunit expression on these electrophysiological properties will also be measured. Thirdly, the above experiments will be repeated using rats fed a high-fructose diet, a well- characterized model of metabolic stress. We will thus test the effects of the high fructose diet on AMPK activity, affective behavior, and BLA electrophysiology. We will also test if the effects of a high-fructose diet can be rescued through administration of a pharmacological AMPK activator, or cell type specific overexpression of wild-type AMPK ?2. The combination of molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques will help us understand the link between metabolic state and mood regulation in both normal and dysfunctional states. Elucidating the role of the AMPK signaling cascade in the BLA could contribute to our understanding of MDD etiology and lead to novel antidepressant development."
"9420667","Project Summary Understanding the mechanistic basis of motoneuron dysfunction and its role in motoneuron diseases would fill a major gap in neuroscience and advance new approaches for treating devastating diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary motor neuropathy and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). These diseases afflict over one hundred thousand adults, infants, and children per year in the US. ALS and SMA are particularly devastating diseases resulting in paralysis and death often within a few years of diagnosis. The genetics of these diseases indicates that motoneurons are particularly vulnerable to defects in proteins tasked with critical RNA processing functions. However, exactly why motoneurons are vulnerable to RNA processing defects is not understood. The scientific rationale for this project is to elucidate mechanistically how mishanding of RNAs can disrupt motoneuron function and lead to motoneuron death. Elucidating the motoneuron-specific RNA processing defects caused by these mutations is essential for understanding motoneurons in both normal and diseased conditions and will direct critically needed therapeutics. To tackle this issue, we focus on the ubiquitously expressed survival motor neuron (SMN) protein and the motoneuron disease SMA. SMA is a motoneuron disease that affects infants/children and is caused by low survival motor neuron (SMN) protein levels. SMN functions in many aspects of RNA metabolism. However, the critical RNA handling function of SMN in motoneurons is unresolved. Evidence supports that SMN interacts with various neuronal RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that stabilize and/or transport RNAs to axons and dendrites during development. Using unique zebrafish models that we have generated, we have shown that SMN is required for normal vertebrate motoneuron development including dendrite formation and motor axon outgrowth and arborization. This is a key finding and reveals that SMA is not a degenerative defect, but the motoneuron dysfunction is caused by poor motoneuron development leading to neuronal failure. We hypothesize that SMN associates with neuronal RBPs and their cargo RNAs in a developmentally regulated manner to direct motoneuron development including axon out growth and branching, dendrite formation, and synapse formation. To test this we will answer three essential questions: What SMN:RBP complexes are in developing motoneurons? How do defects in these RBPs affect motoneuron development? What RNAs are in these complexes, and how are they affected when SMN or the RBPs are missing or decreased? All of our experiments will be performed in vivo in motoneurons, the relevant cell type and use a broad range of experimental approaches such as biochemistry, mass spectrophotometry, RNAseq, single neuron imaging and genetics. Data from these experiments will have broad implications for understanding RNA involvement in normal motoneuron development, SMA, and other motoneuron diseases such as ALS. In addition, our approach will rigorously test the importance of SMN:RBP complexes and their associated RNAs revealing a fundamental molecular mechanism in motoneuron biology."
"9630291","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the last century, our society has changed dramatically, and today more than 20% of the population works odd hours, travels across time zones, and has disrupted sleep patterns. These are all factors affecting circadian rhythms and that lead to medical illnesses including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, decreased cognitive capacity, and impaired fertility. Female fertility is particularly sensitive to compromised circadin rhythms causing dysregulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Formation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a fundamental step in the establishment of circadian rhythms, and is required for fertility. The SCN orchestrates the HPG axis by coordinating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron activity with peripheral tissues and light cycles. Mature GnRH neurons release GnRH in a pulsatile fashion maintaining basal levels of sex steroids and the preovulatory LH surge. Compromised fertility due to abnormal GnRH and SCN function can arise during development by genetic mutations or in adulthood by disrupted SCN function as caused by disrupted sleep patterns. I have developed novel mouse models and functional assays that will allow me to address the relationship between altered GnRH and SCN neuron function during development or in adulthood, and how these relate to fertility. I have identified the homeoprotein Ventral Anterior Homeobox 1 (VAX1) as required for SCN and GnRH neuron development, and specific deletion of Vax1 compromises fertility. In the SCN, VAX1 is necessary for expression of the core SCN transcription factor, SIX homeobox 3 (SIX3). I show that deletion of Vax1 or Six3 in mature neurons affects circadian locomotor activity, leading to abnormal estrous cyclicity and subfertility. The overarching hypothesis is that the homeodomain transcription factor VAX1 is essential for fertility due to its importance during development for GnRH neuron and SCN maturation, and in adulthood for modulating rhythms. Aim 1 will examine the mechanism by which VAX1 determines GnRH neuron fate during development, and investigate the importance of VAX1 in mature GnRH neurons for rhythm generation. Aim 2 will address the importance of VAX1 and SIX3 in SCN function and how disrupted rhythm generation impacts circadian behavior and fertility. Aim 3 will investigate the cascade of homeodomain proteins in SCN development, and their role in SCN pacemaker function. The ultimate goal is to identify therapeutical targets for rhythm abnormalities. I believ these studies will provide valuable insight into novel mechanisms of regulation of fertility, and determine the association between rhythm generation and reproductive function in both GnRH neurons and the SCN. This multifaceted, interdisciplinary approach should yield a comprehensive understanding of the importance of VAX1 in GnRH neuron maturation and function in adulthood and the significance of complete maturation and correct function of the SCN in fertility. This is an ideal pathway to independence supported by an exceptional group of mentors, extensive novel training, a world class scientific environment, and clear departmental commitment."
"9463318","Steroid hormones play important roles in virtually every aspect of cellular metabolism, including the regulation of carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism and immune function (glucocorticoids), as well as salt and water balance and blood pressure regulation (mineralocorticoids). They are also critically involved in the maintenance of secondary sex characteristics, reproductive functions and muscle and bone growth (testosterone, progestins and estrogens). Thus, understanding steroid hormone production has important implications for almost every feature related to normal human health, but also to most diseases, making it quite relevant for the VA. The common precursor of steroid hormone biosynthesis is cholesterol, with the rate-limiting step being the transfer of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Though cholesterol trafficking for steroid hormone production has been the subject of intense investigation, the mechanisms how cholesterol traffics to the outer mitochondrial membrane remain incompletely understood. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the trafficking of cholesterol for steroidogenesis. The overall goal will be achieved by testing 2 major hypotheses. First, we propose the novel hypothesis that cholesteryl esters selectively transferred from HDL traverse the plasma membrane via SR-B1 and at the cytoplasmic side behave as micro-lipid droplets, acquiring lipid droplet- associated proteins that then direct the cholesteryl esters (micro-lipid droplets) to coalesce into mature lipid droplets or to fuse with existing cytoplasmic lipid droplets. This will be accomplished by tracing the movement of cholesteryl esters contained within HDL into lipid droplets in adrenal and gonadal cells in which specific cytosolic proteins have been knocked down or inhibited. Second, we hypothesize that the pathways through which cholesterol is transported from the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, and lipid droplets to mitochondria each involves different mechanisms that comprise both vesicular and non- vesicular means. This aim will be accomplished using several different approaches. First, a novel cell-free in vitro reconstitution assay we have developed for cholesterol transport to mitochondria containing isolated mitochondria and recombinant StAR will be used to assess the efficiency of cholesterol delivery from the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets in the presence of specific recombinant proteins, including SNAREs. Second, we will knockdown specific plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum proteins in granulosa and adrenal cells to assess their impact on cholesterol transport to mitochondria. Third, we will use SNARE mutant mice to compare cholesterol homeostasis and movement to mitochondria and steroidogenesis in vivo. The results from these studies should provide insights into the critical biological process of steroid hormone production."
"9472821","Following the loss of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA), there is increased activity of glutamate neurons within the subthalamic nucleus. These excitatory neurons project to the internal globus pallidus [GPi, or entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) in the rodent], which utilizes the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid). In Parkinson's disease (PD), deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the GPi results in improvement in motor function and provides symptomatic relief. However in a rodent PD model, stimulation of the EPN/GPi did not result in any protection against motor deficits or DA loss following acute intrastriatal infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine. DBS could also be damaging the fibers of passage. However, directly decreasing GABA release from the EPN/GPi neurons without affecting the fibers of passage could answer this concern. Since EPN/GPi neurons utilize the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) for uptake of GABA into synaptic vesicles, deletion of this gene would selectively decrease the release of GABA from those EPN/GPi neurons.  Using the Cre/loxP recombinase gene technology where a specific gene can be silenced, effecting GABA release from the EPN/GPi GABA neurons, can be achieved through deleting a targeted gene in the specific brain area by injecting AAV-Cre into mice that are floxed for the GABA transporter, VGAT (Vgatflox/flox). To determine if deletion of the Vgat gene in the GPi/EPN can be neuroprotective against DA terminal and cell loss using the neurotoxin, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), we find that unilateral infusion of AAV-Cre-GFP (green fluorescent protein) into the EPN/GPi labeled approximately 80-90% of those GABA neurons, as determined by GFP staining of EPN/GPi neurons, and increased GABA immuno-gold labeling within the terminals of the motor thalamus (i.e., the EPN/GPi projects to the motor thalamus). As measured by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, this resulted in a bilateral protection from the loss of DA terminals in the striatum and improved motor function. There was partial protection (~50%) from TH/DA neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Following neurointervention, with unilateral AAV- cre-GFP infusion into the EPN/GPi followed immediately by MPTPtreatment (MPTP/Cre), we find that there is improved motor strength and increased TH protein expression in the striatum and SNpc in the MPTP/Cre vs MPTP only group. Using an additional PD animal model, in which AAV-alpha synuclein (A-Syn) is bilaterally infused into the SNpc, prior deletion of the Vgat gene in the EPN/GPi with AAV-Cre (i.e., protection) resulted in improved motor strength and blockade of TH/DA cell loss in the SNpc compared to the A-Syn only group.  The overall goal of this project is to determine whether unilateral deletion of the Vgat gene, in 2 animal models of PD, within the EPN/GPi, following (i.e., neurorestoration, a more translationally relevant model) either progressive administration of MPTP or intranigral infusion of A-Syn, can bilaterally reverse the loss of DA within the nigrostriatal pathway in both young and aged mice. An additional goal is to determine the role of glutamate in the striatum in reversing the DA depletion due to MPTP. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1.) determine if unilateral deletion of the Vgat gene within the EPN/GPi initiated 4 weeks after progressive MPTP administration can bilaterally reverse the loss of DA markers in the striatum/SN and improve motor function in both young and aged mice, 2.) determine if unilateral deletion of the Vgat gene within the EPN/GPi initiated 8 weeks following bilateral infusion of AAV-A-Syn (mutant form: A53T) into the substantia nigra pars compacta can bilaterally reverse the loss of DA markers in the striatum/SN and improve motor function in both young and aged mice and 3.) determine if the mechanism behind the striatal TH/DA restoration in the MPTP-treated mice following deletion of the Vgat gene within the EPN/GPi is due to increased striatal glutamate. Glutamate antagonists will be infused into the striatum to determine if this will block the DA recovery due to deletion of the Vgat gene in the EPN/GPi following MPTP."
"9592762","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammalian brain function critically relies on sophisticated cytoarchitectonic organization during embryonic development. Cell generation, migration, synapse formation and circuit integration often follow highly stereotyped patterns to form complex laminated or nuclear structures in the brain. Recently developed clonal lineage analysis has revealed stem cell behavior giving rise to laminar structures, such as the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and retina, with unprecedented single-cell resolution. However, the formation of nuclear structures by neural stem cells (NSCs) remains unclear and has yet to be systematically investigated. The mammalian hypothalamus is a heterogeneous nuclear structure that is critical for the integration and homeostatic maintenance of endocrine, autonomic and behavioral functions. Reconstructing how hypothalamic neurons are generated from individual NSCs and organized into discrete nuclei during early development is essential to understand the structure-function relationship of different hypothalamic nuclei and the extent to which this can be modulated by environmental conditions.  We have developed a genetically-based single-cell lineage tracing-technique that employs MADM (mosaic analysis of double marker) animals to label NSCs in the developing embryo and begin to address these outstanding questions of hypothalamic organization. The goal of the proposed research is to reconstruct and quantify the behavior of individually-labeled NSCs in vivo, decipher the general principles organizing hypothalamic nuclei, decode the ontogeny of individual hypothalamic nuclei and explore the ontogenetic plasticity of nuclear organization in the context of a maternal challenge.  The complexity of the anatomical and molecular subdivisions of the hypothalamus, and lack of appropriate genetic tools, has thus far prevented a deep understanding of the organization and ontogeny of this nuclear structure. Successful completion of our study will result in a comprehensive map of single NSCs and their progeny at regional, zonal and nuclear levels, the clonal organization of sibling neurons in a three-dimensional context to determine migratory patterns of newly born neurons, and the capacity of single stem cells to contribute to functionally distinct nuclei. We will also have validated an experimental platform for future mechanistic investigations of hypothalamic dysregulation under pathological conditions, which can lead to targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to preserve critical physiological functions."
"9429536","The advent of massive parallel sequencing highlighted the genetic complexity of cancer, and unveiled the putative contribution of several unsuspected genes to the process of malignant transformation. These advances also indicated a need for the systematic examination of newly-found mutant genes as to determine whether they truly contribute to cancer pathogenesis, or simply represent innocuous variants irrelevant to the observed phenotype. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, is curable in only ~60% of cases. This clinical challenge is associated with the disease?s complex genetics, which include disruption of epigenetic modifiers, constitutive activation of the NF-?B pathway, and deregulation of B cell relevant transcription factors. The latter, can derive from chromosomal translocation, genomic amplification/deletions and somatic mutations. Recently, we developed an IGH-targeted capture/sequencing strategy and discovered novel aberrant gene fusions in DLBCL including the juxtaposing of IRF8 (interferon regulatory factor 8) to the IGH locus, t(14;16)(q32;q24), a prototypical model of transcription factor deregulation in B cell lymphomas. Independently, IRF8 was found to be somatically mutated in ~10% of DLBCL biopsies. Interestingly, close to 50% of the IRF8-mutant DLBCLs also have mutations in KMT2D, a histone methyltransferase that when inactivated enhances the lymphomagenic potential of other genetic lesions. IRF8, a member of the interferon family of transcription factors, is expressed in the germinal center (GC) where it directly influences the expression of several key regulators of the GC reaction, including BCL6, AICDA and PRDM1. The central objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that IRF8 is a bona fide oncogene in DLBCL, which can be deregulated by chromosomal translocation and somatic mutations. To advance this concept, we found that ectopic expression of IRF8 in DLBCL cell lines promotes a lymphomagenic profile characterized by induction of BCL6 and AICDA, suppression of PRDM1 and resistance to apoptosis. In addition, we generated preliminary data to show that the missense IRF8 mutants found in DLBCL are all gain-of-function. Lastly, we created a mouse with B cell restricted transgenic expression of Irf8. Building on our preliminary data, and on the availability of this novel animal model, we propose to address the following specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanism for Irf8 lymphomagenesis in a mouse model that mimics the IGH/IRF8 fusion found in human DLBCL; 2) Characterize in vivo the pro-lymphoma cooperation between the oncogenic Irf8 and the tumor suppressor Kmt2d; 3) Define the functional consequences of the somatic IRF8 mutations found in DLBCL. When this project is completed, we will show that IRF8 functions as an oncogene that cooperates with KMT2D loss for the development of DLBCL. We also expect to mechanistically link IRF8?s lymphomagenesis to the deregulation of BCL6, AICDA and PRDM1."
"9450448","Age-associated immune defects are considered a primary risk factor for TB, but other factors such as the  heightened systemic inflammatory state (inflammaging) observed in elderly individuals have not been  previously considered. During infection, airborne Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is deposited in the lung  where it is exposed to different local environments over time. First, M.tb encounters the alveolar space, where  it will be in direct contact with Alveolar Lining Fluid (ALF) components, notably surfactant and complement, for  an undetermined period. We hypothesize that ALF, containing important innate immune determinants against  M.tb infection, is functionally deficient in old age, largely as a result of oxidative stress, which negatively  impacts the control of M.tb infection in the lung. ALF is generated, secreted and recycled by alveolar epithelial  cells, and is essential for maintaining lung function. Some human ALF components [surfactant proteins A (SP-  A) and D (SP-D), homeostatic hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases), and lipids] are critical elements of the innate  immune system during M.tb infection, playing an important role in M.tb-phagocyte encounters. Oxidative stress  associated with low grade chronic inflammation that occurs during aging is expected to result in changes in  ALF component production and activity. For example, alterations in surfactant lipids are predicted to negatively  affect SP-A and SP-D function. We know little about how oxidative stress and low grade inflammation  associated with aging impact M.tb infection progression in the lung. This knowledge gap limits our ability to  design new approaches for the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines that are effective in the  lung. Here we propose to determine the function of ALF components in the elderly human lung, and their  impact on the establishment and progression of M.tb infection using in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our  proposal is significant and innovative in the field of aging, determining how ALF soluble components in the  elderly lung influence M.tb infection and outcome. Our studies are closely linked to Projects 2 & 3 (innate &  adaptive responses to M.tb infection in aging, respectively) and synergize with Project 4 (circulating molecular  signatures of aging)."
"9459368","Project Summary/Abstract  Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is an optic neuropathy with a characteristic pattern of visual field loss and optic disc cupping due to progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is an important risk factor for POAG, and artificially raising IOP is very effective at inducing glaucoma in animal models. However, the relationship between IOP and RGC death is unclear since some patients with normal IOP develop glaucoma while others with elevated IOP do not. Our group made a breakthrough discovery that a mutation in ADAMTS10 causes POAG in Beagle dogs. This finding was independently validated and expanded by identification of another mutation in ADAMTS10 causing POAG in Norwegian Elkhound dogs and 3 other mutations in a closely-related gene, ADAMTS17, in 3 other dog breeds. Relevant to human glaucoma, an ADAMTS8 locus has been identified associated with vertical cup -disc ratio. These findings suggest that mutations in ADAMTS genes cause POAG. In humans, null mutations of ADAMTS10 cause Weill-Marchesani syndrome, a disease associated with defective microfibrils and characterized by short skeletal features, lens dislocation and glaucoma. ADAMTS10 is a microfibril-associated protein that plays a role in microfibril structure and function. Microfibrils are components of the extracellular matrix that are key regulators of Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF?) signaling and contribute to mechanotransduction involving ligand-independent activation of the Angiotensin II Type I Receptor (AT1R). Hyper-activation of TGF? signaling and altered mechanotransduction are key pathogenic mechanisms for both microfibril deficiencies and POAG. Identification of a microfibril-associated gene as causative for POAG led us to formulate our central hypothesis that ADAMTS10 mutations cause glaucoma by disrupting microfibril structure and function. Establishing microfibril defects as a disease mechanism would suggest that treatments effective in other diseases caused by microfibril deficiencies may be applied to POAG. AT1R blockers (ARBs) are effective in treating diseases associated with microfibril deficiencies and they have been considered as potential glaucoma treatments owing to their IOP-lowering and neuroprotective effects. Based on our microfibril hypothesis, we will test the efficacy of ARBs in treating glaucoma caused by ADAMTS10 mutations. For this project, we will use mouse and zebrafish lines homozygous for glaucoma-causing mutations in Adamts10. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the fundamental hypothesis that microfibril deficiencies cause POAG. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate molecular mechanisms of POAG caused by ADAMTS10 mutations. In Specific Aim 3, we will test the efficacy of ARBs in treating or preventing glaucoma phenotypes caused by ADAMTS10 mutations."
"9640398","Abstract Many mammalian organs (skin, stomach, intestines, colon, and eye) possess a source of adult stem cells that continually replenishes their rapidly self-renewing epithelial surface. The limbus contains a small subpopulation of rare limbal stem cells (LSC) that continually repopulates the corneal epithelium. Patients with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) are unable to regenerate the corneal epithelium, resulting in conjunctivalization of the corneal stroma that triggers neovascularization, chronic inflammation, and ultimately blindness due to an irreversibly opaque cornea. Several approaches have been used to replace LSC by transplanting limbal tissue or ex vivo expanded limbal cells. These procedures have obtained some success, mainly using autologous limbal tissue from patients with unilateral LSCD. Patients with bilateral LSCD have no source of autologous LSC and much less success was observed with allogeneic limbal tissue transplants. However, success of all these procedures was severely limited by the inability to prospectively identify and purify LSC. This problem was recently addressed by the three PIs of this proposal, who discovered that the ABCB5 gene, a new member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of active transporters, is expressed by stem cells of the limbus. Normal function of ABCB5+ LSC is required for corneal development and repair, through critical roles in stem cell maintenance and survival, and knockout mice that lack ABCB5 do not develop a fully differentiated mature corneal epithelium. Importantly, ABCB5 is a cell surface protein and specific monoclonal antibodies developed by the laboratories of Co-PIs Drs. M. Frank and N. Frank are capable of isolating pure ABCB5-positive cells from the limbus. Transplantation of purified human ABCB5+ (but not ABCB5-) LSC onto the corneal stroma of immunodeficient mice with induced LSCD restored the corneal epithelium, indicating that this purified LSC population has the potential to significantly improve therapy for corneal disease associated with LSCD. Our currently funded RO1 project builds upon these results to address the important challenges that prevent successful stem cell therapy for patients with unilateral or bilateral LSCD, with the overall hypothesis that ABCB5+ stem cells from the limbus can be isolated and expanded ex vivo as a source of stem cells to regenerate the corneal epithelium when transplanted to recipients with either a unilateral or bilateral LSCD. This supplemental grant application is based upon early results of this project demonstrating that human ABCB5+ LSC can be expanded in vitro for use as successful pure stem cells grafts in pre-clinical therapeutic transplantation models. With supplemental funding, we wish now to focus on furthering these results with a view towards advancing ABCB5+ LSC transplantation to clinical testing, through (1) conducting GMP-conforming pilot production of in vitro-expanded LSC for IND-enabling studies, and (2) using GMP-produced in vitro-expanded LSC for initial preclinical IND-enabling studies (pharmacology/efficacy and mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics/biodistribution, toxicology, and carcinogenicity)."

"9458100","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a mentored training grant that combines research efforts with a didactic plan designed to provide a strong background in immunology, skin physiology/carcinogenesis and the team science approach necessary for the PI's future success as an independent investigator. The PI has a long-standing interest in the inflammatory and immune-related molecular mechanisms of skin disease and the research focus of this proposal investigates the role of Toll-Like Receptor 3 in skin homeostasis, injury and neoplasia. TLR3 is over- expressed within non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and no study to date has examined whether activation of the TLR3 signaling pathway plays a role in protection or is involved in neoplasia initiation and progression. This proposal will use both in vitro and in vivo methodologies to test the overall hypothesis activation of the TLR3 signaling pathway induces injured keratinocytes to acquire cancer stem cell-like properties, which subsequently promotes tumorigenesis. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that TLR3 signaling promotes changes in keratinocytes consistent with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In Aim 2, we will use both in vitro and in vivo models to test the hypothesis that TLR3 signaling plays a causal role in formation NMSC by UVB. This proposal challenges current research which focuses on pro-inflammatory role of TLR3 and highlights its likely function as an initiator of tumorigenesis. Our proposal is significant in that it will advance the field of skin biology by increasing our understanding of a link between innate immunity and skin tumorigenesis."
"9462785","Project 2: TAU Abstract: The neuropathologic definition of Alzheimer's disease (AD) relies on the presence of two well-characterized protein aggregates in the brain, amyloid-beta (A?) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles. The widespread use of A? positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technology has helped identify the prevalence of significant A? deposition in vivo in the elderly population, in which elevated levels of A? are found in about 30% of cognitively normal elderly (NC) subjects at a mean age of about 75 years old, 60% of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, and 90% of clinically diagnosed AD subjects. Efforts to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents have been successful recently with the application of several new tau PET radioligands, including the radioligand [18F]T807 (T807). We propose to characterize the behavior of T807, in concert with other biomarkers of neurodegeneration, in NC, MCI, and AD subjects. In cross-sectional studies, we will investigate regional differences in brain tau load in the different subject groups and compare the in vivo topology of abnormal tau deposition with the pattern predicted by postmortem Braak staging. We will leverage existing data on [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) hypometabolism, hippocampal volume (HV) loss, [11C]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) measures of A? load, and cognitive performance measures in subjects recruited from NC, MCI and AD cohorts at the University of Pittsburgh in whom these biomarker measures have been obtained with separate funding to correlate with the T807 PET results. Following cross-sectional evaluation of tau load in the different groups, we will rescan all subjects using T807 at 30 months to evaluate longitudinal changes in T807 signal and compare tau changes with changes in the other biomarker measures in the same subjects. The combination of in vivo tau and A? imaging has the potential to provide a more complete view of the pathological progression of AD from prodromal to end-stage phases. Three NC groups will be evaluated in the proposed studies and compared to amyloid-positive MCI and AD groups. These NC groups include: amyloid-negative NC with no abnormal FDG and HV markers (Stage-0 NC); amyloid-positive NC with or without abnormal FDG and/or HV markers (Stage-1 and Stage-2 NC); and amyloid-negative NC with abnormal FDG and/or HV markers, characterized as  suspected non-amyloid pathophysiology (SNAP) . Early studies indicate that some SNAP subjects may be on an AD pathway of cognitive decline and some may be on non-AD pathways. It is not clear whether neocortical tauopathy precedes A? abnormalities in SNAP subjects or whether the order of tau vs. A? dysregulation will distinguish which pathway SNAP subjects take. In vivo topographic changes in tau deposition relative to changes in A? deposition will be determined using T807 PET imaging in concert with PiB PET imaging. It is anticipated that the use of both T807 and PiB in these studies will help clarify the temporal sequences of tau and A? changes in mesial temporal cortex and neocortical brain regions in normal aging and in AD pathways."
"9541855","Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how a therapeutically active drug delivery system (DDS) modified by hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will affect the pharmacokinetics and anticancer activity of oxaliplatin (OX). Specifically, this proposal will assess the sensitizing effects of our previously synthesized DDS modified by HCQ, termed Chloroquine-Altered PolySaccharide (CAPS), in the context of enhancing tumor uptake, reducing primary tumor growth, and preventing liver metastasis in pancreatic cancer (PC). The poor outcomes seen in patients diagnosed with PC can largely be attributed to the development of drug resistance. Recently, the ability of combinatorial therapies to prevent resistance has been examined, which has yielded promising results. However, combination therapies like FOLFIRINOX (FOLinic acid, Fluorouracil, IRINotecan, and OXaliplatin) suffer from increasing side effects that often require lowering the dose of drug treatments below what is required to see an optimal response from the cancer or discontinuing the therapy all together. To enhance tumor sensitivity towards chemotherapeutics and prevent resistance, chemosensitizing agents are being developed. One of the most promising agents is HCQ, which through several biological mechanisms like autophagy inhibition and CXCR4 antagonism can enhance the cancer killing ability of certain drugs. Thus creating a DDS modified by HCQ can increase the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic by sensitizing PC tumors to the therapeutic in addition to improving the pharmacokinetic profile and tumor accumulation. Because OX is one of the main sources of side effects in FOLFIRINOX therapy, OX has been selected for encapsulation with CAPS. CAPS retains the biological activity of HCQ in vitro. This preserved function translated into the ability of CAPS to reduce primary tumor growth and liver metastasis of PC in vivo more than free HCQ likely through increased tumor accumulation of HCQ via the DDS. Our hypothesis is that the combination of CAPS and OX can reduce tumor growth and metastatic spread of PC compared to the combination of HCQ and OX. Secondarily, encapsulating OX within CAPS nanoparticles (Chemo-CAPS) may further improve the anticancer activity for the combination of HCQ and OX through enhanced tumor accumulation of both drugs while reducing off-target effects. To test these hypotheses, two specific aims will be used. In Specific Aim 1, OX will be encapsulated within CAPS nanoparticles (Chemo-CAPS), and the drug release and stability of Chemo-CAPS will be determined. In Specific Aim 2, a comprehensive pharmacokinetic study of CAPS and Chemo-CAPS will evaluate tissue distribution, metabolism, excretion, blood levels, and tumor uptake of HCQ and OX in mice. Then, in an orthotopic syngeneic KPC mouse model of PC, the ability of CAPS and Chemo- CAPS to reduce primary tumor growth, inhibit liver metastasis, and mitigate side effects like neuropathy will be determined."
"9475078","This research will develop an innovative therapy to promote tissue regeneration and reverse the consequences of recalcitrant wound healing. It is particularly relevant to our Veteran population that suffers the consequences of injury and aging. The $5 billion global market for ?advanced wound care? is anticipated to triple in the next ten years. We have a rapidly growing cohort of older veterans with diabetes, a new cohort of wounded warriors with injuries that include non-healing ulcers from spinal cord injury, multiple traumatic injuries and burns. Hence Veteran populations are at risk for a staggering number of chronic wounds. We propose to use a secreted nanovesicle from adipose derived stem cells (human ADSC). Adipose tissue is an abundant and renewable source of stem cells. Human ADSC release trophic factors that stimulate endogenous repair mechanisms in wounds, and they have immunomodulatory effects, responding to the microenvironment. They have been shown to heal wounds. However, hADSC research is flawed by the lack of standardization and delivery methods. Our goal is to harness the promise of stem cell regenerative secreted factors to heal wounds. We have identified a wound healing treatment using conditioned media (CM) collected from hADSC in culture. We recognize that CM contains exosomes secreted by hADSC, and the factors within the exosomes act in a paracrine manner. In addition to lipids and proteins, exosomes contain various species of RNA. One type, long non- coding RNA, is of particular interest in that it is only secreted by stem cells. Once cells start to differentiate to lineages such as bone and adipocytes, it is retained for a nuclear function. The secreted long non-coding RNA that we find in exosomes is MALAT1. It functions in wound healing, and we predict that exosomes rich in MALAT1 will be able to heal a variety of wounds. We hypothesize that MALAT probably derepresses genes for migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis via its interaction with microRNAs. We will examine how exosomes function in vitro in a human dermal fibroblast wound healing assay. We will use a rat ischemic wound model for examining how exosomes function in vivo. Both of these models will let us optimize the number and concentrations of exosomes that allow for wound closure and modulation of angiogenesis. We propose improvements to hADSC that will allow for collection of more exosomes. Exosomes are more stable than stem cells for wound applications. They can be stored in low temperatures, applied topically and be made available to wounds in emergency rooms and for home use. This project is the first step in making hADSC exosomes a clinical reality for wound repair and tissue regeneration."
"9431046","Objective & Clinical Relationship: Our long-term goal is to identify the alcohol-mediated tissue injury mechanisms observed in individuals with alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) so that better early biomarkers of injury can be developed leading to enhanced approaches to minimize pathogen susceptibility and prevent the high costs of pneumonia. Research Design & Methodology: Alcohol abuse causing increased susceptibility to pneumonia has been known for over 200 years. NIAAA publications state that hospitalized individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) have a 3-fold risk of mortality from pneumonia. Alcohol modulates both the innate and adaptive immune systems of the lung resulting in increased susceptibility and decreased resolution of infection. For 20 years, our research group has been a recognized leader in studying the chronic effects of alcohol on the innate immunity provided by the mucociliary transport apparatus. Because the majority (>90%) individuals with AUDs smoke cigarettes, we have chosen to take the public health relevant approach of studying the combination lung injury effects of both cigarettes and alcohol. In our previous funding cycle, we identified that the lungs represent a unique environment for the formation of stable malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde protein adducts (MAA adducts), but only under conditions of combined cigarette smoke and alcohol exposure. These MAA adducts cause airway epithelial cell cilia slowing and impair the innate pathogen clearance from the lung. Our published and preliminary data demonstrate that surfactant protein D (SPD) is a major lung protein that gets adducted when lung aldehyde concentrations are elevated during combined smoke and alcohol exposure. Using human samples derived from the NIAAA-supported Colorado Pulmonary Alcohol Research Consortium, we have found that MAA adducts are detected in the lung lavage macrophages and fluid only in individuals with AUDs who also smoke. We have observed that the AUD smokers have decreased lung mucosal sIgA and that MAA adduct treatment of airway epithelium blocks transcytotic processing of sIgA mucosal secretion. Because of these important and novel observations, we now propose to extend our research on the pathogenesis of the MAA adduct to lung macrophages, mucosal sIgA, and SPD. Our overall hypothesis is that MAA adducts uniquely form in the lungs of individuals who consume both alcohol and smoke cigarettes, leading to alterations in innate lung defense. We will investigate this hypothesis through 3 aims: Aim 1: MAA adducted lung SPD (MAA-SPD) binds to lung macrophages via scavenger receptor A leading to alterations in macrophage function; Aim 2: MAA-SPD prevents sIgA mucosal secretion in lung by altering epithelial cell processing of dimerized IgA; and Aim 3: MAA adduction of SPD decreases its anti-microbial action."
